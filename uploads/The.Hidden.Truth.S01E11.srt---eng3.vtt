00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.880
Dad?

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.350
Dad?

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.430
Dad?

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.420
=The Hidden Truth=

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.060
=Episode 11=

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.200
This new place of mine

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.070
is way more comfortable than the old one.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.660
(May wealth flow in)

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.520
Trust me.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.560
Once we reopen,

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.710
you'll be the first call I make.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.360
Of course.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.750
Bye.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.240
Mr. Wang.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.870
Have you made up your mind?

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.120
When's the banquet?

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.710
Where?

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.120
I don't know yet.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.630
Bai's still preparing.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.960
I'm waiting for his word.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.360
But right now,

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.360
the question is you.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.710
What's your decision?

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.400
Don't stress too much.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.960
I can bring my guys to back you up.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.030
But like I said,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.840
I won't do the killing for you.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.470
This time,

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.430
I will cook myself.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.400
What did you buy?

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.240
Buy one, get one free.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.190
That's solid.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.310
Hello? Anyone?

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.840
Neighbors?

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.120
- Yeah.
- That's right.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.080
Could you help me

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.750
call a locksmith?

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.560
Dad?

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:19.790
Dad?

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:32.790
Yimo,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.480
where are you going?

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.440
Out for a bit.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.600
Let me go with you.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.960
Ms. Tong,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.560
let's talk inside.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.760
Okay.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.200
Yimo,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.040
listen to me.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.560
Ms. Tong,

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.720
about what happened before,

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.240
my dad chose to let it go

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.950
because he had feelings for you.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.560
So I didn't say much.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.630
I only hope

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.070
that once it settles,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.830
you and my dad can live a good life.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.200
Yimo,

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.360
what are you going to do?

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.040
You don't need to know.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.680
Just watch my dad for me.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.120
Don't let him be reckless.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.840
No.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.600
I can't let you leave.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.200
Ms. Tong.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.880
Listen to me.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.440
Mr. Bai,

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.600
you've been looking for me?

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.150
Sit.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.640
I've been waiting for you.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.000
Looks familiar?

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.000
Having a meal with you

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.550
wasn't easy.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.230
Let's eat.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.080
Why aren't you eating?

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.480
Not to your taste?

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.110
I'm picky.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.800
This meal...

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.240
You should enjoy it by yourself.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.870
After all,

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.510
there won't be many chances

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.280
like this again.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.040
Yimo?

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.440
Yimo?

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:08.710
Wang Yimo?

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.200
Ali.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.510
She left.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.320
How could you

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.670
lock your daughter inside

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.750
before leaving?

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:18.870
She called a locksmith.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.550
Here. Your new keys.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.470
Thanks.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:23.390
No problem.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.020
(Li Tong)

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:51.590
Hello?

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:52.750
Ali.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.130
Yimo came back

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.240
and ran out again.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.270
I tried to stop her.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.360
But I couldn't.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.200
Hello, Bai.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.870
I know it's you.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:34.910
Let my daughter go.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.790
This has nothing to do with her.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.670
Nothing to do with her?

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.320
How could it not?

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.320
Everything is about her.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.440
If it weren't for her,

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.270
we wouldn't be like this.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:49.790
Bai, listen to me.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:52.360
Come at me.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.270
Don't touch my daughter.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.270
Your daughter?

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.390
Your daughter's been dead for years.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.960
All these years,

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.000
you found yourself a stand-in.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.360
Raised her like she was your own.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:11.630
Wang Li,

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.240
so the little Huahua
who almost got me killed back then

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.550
was in your hands.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.040
No.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:21.910
She's in my hands.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:23.850
The afternoon after tomorrow.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.360
The cement plant outside the city.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.910
Come alone.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.870
Ali,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.910
I'll go with you.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.240
I'm going alone.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.550
Otherwise,

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.390
my daughter's in danger.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.060
(Procaine Injection)

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.840
This little girl

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.270
is pretty tough.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.080
Just like her dad.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.680
Master.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.160
Got it.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.670
Huangshan toll station

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.000
caught Wang Li's car on camera.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.670
The first time was at 11:41.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.030
And the second time

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.200
was at 1:26.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.030
That's about an hour and a half.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.750
Plenty of time

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.270
to dig up a body in the hills

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:43.870
and dump it by the road.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.080
It must be him.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.510
Wang Li dug up the remains

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.320
has to be tied to the Naked Banquet Case.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.790
He's the missing piece

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.600
from fifteen years ago.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.320
The kitchen team at the banquet

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:02.440
must've been his people.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.200
Have forensics

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.440
push harder.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:08.840
See if we can find

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.440
any direct evidence.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.080
Something's off.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.680
Really off.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.790
I've got a bad feeling.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.440
Maybe we shouldn't wait.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.790
Bring him in now.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.960
You think

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:34.000
he dug up the body

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.080
to draw our attention

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.680
to Bai?

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:38.960
Exactly.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.440
You and I both know Wang Li.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.320
He's sharp,

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:46.820
and he knows how to cover his tracks.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.480
This move's too abnormal.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.910
The reason you're uneasy

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:54.590
is probably

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.200
connected to Wang Yimo.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.670
I tried calling her

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.080
to ask about Wang Li.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:06.920
No answer.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.670
Something's happened to them.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.960
Go get Wang Li.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.160
Use Zhang Ming as the excuse.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.280
Bring him in quietly.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.120
Don't tip him off.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:21.960
See how he reacts.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.680
Yes, sir.

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.070
I just need to ask you a few things.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.000
Don't run.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.070
Wang Yimo's been abducted.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.440
I have to save her.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:52.660
Where?

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.030
I'll call the team. Don't go alone.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.150
Right now,

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.640
you're the only one I trust.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.590
Open the door.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.790
I'm coming with you.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.480
I have to go alone now.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.190
Before three.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.310
At the cement plant.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.550
If anything happens to me,

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.510
take care of Yimo.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.840
Wang Li!

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.830
Master, Wang Yimo was abducted.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.790
Wang Li went on his own.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.200
I couldn't stop him.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.310
Three p.m. The cement plant.

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:34.640
Bring backup. I'm going now.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.000
Bai?

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:55.150
Bai?

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.150
Bai?

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:07.720
Bai?

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.320
Where are you?

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.430
Yimo?

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.510
Wang Yimo!

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.070
How do I get up there?

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.480
Bai, come out!

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.080
Bai!

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.440
Bai!

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:41.790
Mr. Wang.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.110
Li Xu,

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.160
you prick.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.170
Pocketed it and bailed?

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.400
I found Bai for you.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:54.880
He's right here.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:56.750
You said

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.200
you'd handle it yourself.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.310
I didn't stop you, did I?

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.550
Our deal is over.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:03.510
What do you mean?

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.160
I had a deal with you.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.270
I had one with him too.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.440
Now it's between me and Bai.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.910
Go.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:23.840
Li Xu.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.160
You scumbag!

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:28.670
Let me go!

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:30.590
Stop!

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.840
Get him!

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.950
Darn it!

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.280
Freeze!

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.950
Police!

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:15.880
Drop it! Don't move!

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.320
Police! Don't move!

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.200
- Don't move.
- Drop it! Now!

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.320
Captain Zhao.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:25.320
Captain Zhao.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.480
Save my daughter.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:28.840
Where is she?

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.200
She's up there.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:33.870
Where is she?

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.240
Where's Tang Tang?

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.320
Tang Tang?

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.270
He went that way.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.700
Tang Tang!

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.910
Tang Tang.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.080
Tang Tang.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.310
Ambulance!

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.480
Mrs. Tang.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:50.950
Mrs. Tang.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:52.350
Tang.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.020
(Operating Room)

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.790
Doctor, is he okay?

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.810
He's not seriously injured.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.750
After treatment,

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:58.310
his vitals are stable.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:07.260
(Operating Room)

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.030
What's wrong with you?

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.750
What do you think?

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.440
Who knew Wang Li would call the cops?

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:54.920
Contact the company.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:57.110
Have them figure something out.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.480
We need to leave now.

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.750
Stop it. I can't read that.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.940
(You've lost control. Company spoiled you.)

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:18.750
Lost control?

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:20.670
Tell me.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.270
How did I lose control?

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.030
Where?

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.080
Caicai.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.030
You dare to push me this far?

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.720
Listen to me carefully.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:35.670
Right now,

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.830
we're in the same boat.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:41.720
If you want to walk away clean,

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:43.400
you'll have to protect me.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.030
Either we leave together,

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.000
or

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.760
we die together.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.280
Got it?

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.240
Master.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:11.670
How are you feeling?

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:14.350
Thirsty.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.950
Alright.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.000
No, wait.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.840
Hold on.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:31.110
Slow down.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.550
Did we get everyone?

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.000
Only Wang Li and Li Xu's men.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:44.350
We couldn't find

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.950
Wang Yimo.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.270
She must've taken

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.240
before we arrived.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.480
Need some vitamin?

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:04.030
I just peeled an apple.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:05.390
Well...

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.800
Alright.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:11.670
Alright, alright.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.960
Easy. Don't laugh.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.350
Be careful.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:20.350
Okay.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:23.400
I'm fine. Really.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.270
Be careful.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:26.110
Watch the steps.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.680
We're home.

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:33.370
Easy, easy.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.350
It's alright.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.030
I'll sit for a bit.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:40.200
Get some rest.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:48.870
Careful, it's hot.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:50.870
Master.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.210
Don't do this.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.270
You're making me nervous.

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.000
How come?

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.310
I'm just being nice.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:01.880
Sorry, old man.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.000
Been a rough few days for you.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.880
I've made you worry and scared.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.830
You've got thick skin

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:09.000
and you're still saying sorry?

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.550
Lucky, though.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.640
You fell from that height

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.160
and barely hurt.

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.310
Maybe your parents

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.440
are watching over you.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.040
You know,

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.830
waiting outside the OR for you,

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.070
this old heart of mine

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.920
almost gave out from the fear.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:37.480
Only happened twice in my life.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.920
Last time was your parents.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:48.960
Sit. Sit.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:49.820
Don't stand.

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.030
Making me nervous.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:02.150
Old man,

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.080
you have

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.000
never told me

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.350
how my parents died.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.310
Can you tell me today?

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.110
Back then,

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.110
your parents and I

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:29.790
were working

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:32.960
a wildlife smuggling case.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.880
During the chase,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:36.840
I was driving,

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:39.070
and the criminals rammed us.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.240
Your parents died

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:43.760
in the crash.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.920
After that,

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:55.960
I couldn't drive anymore.

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.310
Bai Qiming

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.590
was in that ring too.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.590
He was a minor player.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.200
We had no direct evidence.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.510
He got away.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.830
Bai Qiming?

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.920
I never thought he'd be tied to that case.

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:25.310
Seeing him again
in the Naked Banquet Case,

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.640
I regretted it deeply.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.240
If we'd widened the net

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.090
back then,

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:32.480
maybe none of that

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:33.720
would've happened.

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:35.190
I really...

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:39.030
I really regret it.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:41.790
That's enough.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.590
What do you always teach me?

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.110
Anyway,

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.880
cases are cases.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.030
Facts matter.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:53.070
Criminals were too cunning.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.750
That's not on you.

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:57.240
Look at me.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.110
I became a detective

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.030
and a pretty good one.

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:02.200
I do this not just for my parents,

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.350
but for you too.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.030
What's hanging there?

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.590
Certificate of Honor.

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:13.030
(Certificate of Honor)
Comrade Zhao Fengcheng.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.440
Third-Class Merit.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:17.720
You're a good cop.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.560
Right.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:29.660
(For Outstanding Service;
Zhao Fengcheng; Third-Class Merit)

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.880
Time to get up. What time is it?

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.920
Recovering doesn't mean sleeping all day.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.550
Let me sleep a bit more, just a little.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.280
What do you want for breakfast?

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.640
Wontons or Soup Dumplings.

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:08.590
Alright.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:11.370
There's an apple on the table.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.280
Eat it

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.480
before it browns.

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:16.240
Perfectly peeled today.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:19.400
Thank you.

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:27.670
Zhao.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:28.790
Paid already.

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:29.640
Okay.

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:32.590
How's Tang Tang?

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:33.490
He's fine.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:34.350
Good.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.160
- See you.
- Yeah, see you.

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.480
Robbery!

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.030
Give me my bag!

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:50.590
Help!

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.240
Anyone?

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:52.480
- Hello, 911?
- Call the police!

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.790
