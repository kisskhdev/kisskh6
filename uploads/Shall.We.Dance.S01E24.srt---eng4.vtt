00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.540
Aunt.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.860
Aunt.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.220
You have kept your doors
closed for many days.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.979
How did you

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.220
end up with white hair?

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.340
I came to bid you farewell.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.820
I want to take the child away.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.380
So she will no longer
bear the burden of her bloodline,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.980
and truly live as an ordinary person,
free and unbound.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.580
I will follow your wishes.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.900
But if one day

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.620
you wish to return,

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.180
will you come and see me?

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.700
All right.

00:01:49.725 --> 00:01:51.125
Before leaving,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.340
I would like to see Xiao Man once.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.700
All right.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:23.940
Sister in law.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.200
You protected me
and helped me ascend the throne.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.680
You endured public judgment
and assisted my rule until today.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.260
The hardships you bore
and the grace you showed

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.300
are things I will never forget.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.660
This was a duty I was bound to fulfill.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.940
From childhood, Your Majesty

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.900
was born in an abandoned palace

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.300
and never truly received
any fatherly love.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.980
Thankfully, Xiao Man stayed
by your side from a young age.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.520
These past two months, she has
been recovering from her injuries.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.700
The two of us often sit facing
each other in silence.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.180
Each time I try to speak,

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.980
the pain spreading through
my body chokes my throat.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.180
Why not give everyone
a little more time?

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.580
Time

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.740
can soothe the wounds in every heart.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.020
Your Majesty must create Great Qian

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.980
a completely new era.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.980
Aunt, please be at ease.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.499
I will devote myself to the people

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.220
with unwavering loyalty and effort.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.980
I,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.700
thank you, Aunt,
for your guidance and support.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.020
Thank you, Grand Princess,
for securing the state.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.980
Elder Sister.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.220
You can now live without restraint

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.420
and spend your life in freedom
and peace, can you not?

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.139
Go beyond the frontier.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.260
Let us go.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.300
Let us go.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.380
(Chu Wuju.)

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.020
(May I live unbound
from this day forward.)

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.180
(Free and at ease.)

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.139
(Xiao Man.)

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.340
(Your emperor
has finally kept his promise.)

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.059
(When the realm was struck by turmoil,)

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.300
(the state was preserved from peril.)

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.620
(He stood only by justice,)

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.220
(and thus drew
the hatred of the corrupt.)

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.459
(The late Emperor
knew the wrong done to him,)

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.100
(and I have long cherished his loyalty.)

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.580
(Today, the Zhen family
is fully exonerated.)

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.620
(Zhen Xiujin is posthumously honored
as Duke Protector of the State.)

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.700
(Xiao Congrong is posthumously honored
as Loyal and Righteous Defender-General.)

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.100
(The Zhen family's
eldest son, Zhen Muyu,)

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.499
(was in life Prince Consort
to the Grand Princess)

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.300
(and Minister of War.)

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.339
(In the campaign to quell
the border unrest,)

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.139
(he fell in service to the state.)

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.619
(He shall be laid to rest)

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.100
(alongside the Duke Protector
of the State and the Defender-General.)

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.579
(A mausoleum shall be built
beside the Imperial Tombs)

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.459
(to show my honor and remembrance.)

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.580
(By imperial decree.)

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.460
(Father.)

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:37.900
(Mother.)

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.820
(Uncle.)

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.260
(Elder Brother.)

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.380
(Your injustice)

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.300
(has finally been set right.)

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.980
(Your Majesty.)

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.460
(After all that has happened,)

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.539
(I still cannot let go)

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.300
(of my uncle's and brother's deaths.)

00:08:56.137 --> 00:08:58.097
(I wish to leave the palace for a time)

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.580
(and reflect in peace.)

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.580
Xiao Man.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.020
Are you leaving me again?

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.980
Can we let time take care of everything?

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.539
This is far enough.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.820
Do not walk me any farther.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.780
Xiao Man.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.860
Whether three years, five years,
or however many it takes,

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.539
this vast palace and I
will wait for your return,

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.299
day and night.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.620
We will wait for your return.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.619
I heard your son has fallen for the

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.620
(Three years later)
Wang family's fourth daughter.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.219
I am at my wits' end.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.779
Tell me, of all the young ladies out there,
why did my son have to choose her?

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.340
He just had to fancy
the Wang family's fourth daughter.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.060
He pesters me every day to go
and propose on his behalf.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.099
I say, you are the one
who is never satisfied.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.379
Is this not good enough?

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.499
Stop being so picky.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.179
At the very least, your son

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.459
is not like
our remarkable Son of Heaven.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.580
Is he?

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.779
You see, past emperors

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.019
all had countless consorts
in the inner palace.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.379
Ours is already twenty-two,

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.340
yet has neither consort nor heir.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:31.939
As an emperor,

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.780
he is a fine one.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.979
It is just that his fondness for men,

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.660
that will not do.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.500
What about the future of the realm...

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.539
Lower your voice.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.459
What?

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.179
What fondness for men?

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.179
Not so loud.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.059
Shh.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.380
Exactly.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.700
Why shush?

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.459
Is it not true that

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.419
everyone in the realm already knows?

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.259
I heard he

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.499
dotes on a single eunuch,

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.099
surname Jia, or was it Ma?

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.619
I cannot even recall the name.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.659
It must be rumor.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:03.780
I do not believe it.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.939
Our young emperor
has delayed for so long.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.940
Could he be waiting for you?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.659
Then I must hurry back and prepare
the betrothal gifts for my son.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.899
I need to give that troublemaker

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.420
some peace of mind.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.219
I think the fifteenth
of the eighth month would be perfect.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.819
A full moon and a happy reunion.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.139
Exactly.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.859
Time really flies. Mid Autumn Festival
will be here again soon.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.179
Waiting for good news from your family.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.300
Indeed.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.020
Time passes so quickly.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.939
If you ask me,
that fourth girl still will not do.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.700
Such a foul temper.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.820
I truly do not like her.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.220
How did he ever take a liking to her?

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.259
(Where did you come from?)

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.700
(How dare you flee the palace with
your belongings in the dead of night.)

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.139
(It is too late.)

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.339
(I should go back now.)

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.340
(See you tomorrow, Big Flower.)

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.739
(You must come tomorrow.)

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.220
(I will be waiting for you.)

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.780
(I will come.)

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.219
(We will dance together again tomorrow.)

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.100
(Woof.)

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.100
Where did you come from?

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.380
How dare you flee the palace with
your belongings in the dead of night.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.820
Which palace are you from?

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.580
Why are you here so late at night?

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.300
Do you not recognize me?

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.580
I do not.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.580
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.540
My name is Big Flower.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.300
I am Xiao Man.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.660
A friend once told me

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.340
that in dancing, what matters
most is not the steps.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.420
As long as you are happy,
that is enough.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.699
Except for you,

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.260
I will marry no one else.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.900
(But thankfully,)

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.900
(you are here.)

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.140
(Wishing to buy osmanthus wine
and sail together,)

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.700
(yet it is never quite)

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.260
(the same as our youthful days.)

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:25.630
(At last, the clouds part
and the moon appears.)

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.460
(The one who entered
my heart in lonely youth)

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:57.020
(is the one I cherish most
in this lifetime.)
