WEBVTT

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.939
Look.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.959
How about this one?

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.439
A junior executive at a company.

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:02.680
Parents are healthy.

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:03.340
This works.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.140
Her mom's nice.

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:06.120
Don't swear.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.519
I...

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.560
I meant the child's mother is nice.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.039
Why look at her mother?

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.479
Her father is alive and well.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.280
I want you to look at the girl.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.979
Fine.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.580
Xiao Cai,

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.460
are you planning to swap your son's wife?

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.319
What? No.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.879
I'm planning to introduce one to Yusheng.

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:22.840
He downloaded that app for me.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.599
On there,

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.259
not only can you pull up their profile,

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.139
but it can also calculate

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.659
whether two people are a match.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:28.479
Really?

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.919
Then calculate for me.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.780
Am I a match with Ms. Liu?

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.479
Pfft!

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:33.879
A match, right?

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.340
Surfing the web on phones is so convenient now.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.180
Back when I traded stocks,

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.939
I'd sit in front of the computer staring all day.

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:41.419
Now, I can watch from bed.

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.939
Yeah.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.860
Before, you lost money sitting.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.340
A "sit-loss."

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.259
Now you're a "lie-loss."

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.080
You're just jealous of me.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.199
Your lousy stocks.

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:51.500
What do I have to be jealous of?

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:52.719
Green and eco-friendly.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.719
You're the one.

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:54.539
Alright.

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:56.020
Stop bickering, you two old guys.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.080
Help me take a look.

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:58.800
Is this girl okay?

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.379
This one...

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:00.539
She's fine.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.520
Xiao Cai,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.599
did Yusheng ask you to find him a partner?

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:04.840
You're so enthusiastic.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.240
We have to take initiative.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.740
Right?

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.599
The kid helped us so much.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.860
If we introduce a partner to him,

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:12.000
isn't that our duty?

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.080
This is called...

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.740
"When eating the well, don't forget the water digger."

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:16.520
I don't think I said that right.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.900
Ms. Liu.

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.960
Come, here.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.620
Okay, Ms. Liu.

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:19.460
Sit at this table.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.219
Okay.

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.219
Yusheng.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.979
Look.

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:22.879
Quick, look at this one.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.740
This one.

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:25.340
Thirty-nine years old. How about it?

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:27.120
Auntie Cai.

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.699
How many times have I told you?

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.259
I already like someone.

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:31.680
Yingzi.

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:32.939
Stop thinking about her.

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:34.659
She's going abroad soon.

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.159
This one's good. Thirty-nine.

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.139
Besides, she's way too old for me.

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:38.639
This...

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.060
You kids don't understand.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.180
Older is better.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.759
This...

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.300
What's good about being old?

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:46.560
Ms. Liu.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.800
You...

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:49.180
What's wrong today?

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.139
You have to admit you're getting old.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.699
I feel like my health lately

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.139
just isn't what it used to be.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.219
Getting on in years,

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.719
who doesn't get sick?

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:01.120
Therefore,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.379
I've decided to make a will.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.099
Why make a will when you're fine?

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.479
Ms. Liu's idea is very forward-thinking.

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.960
It allows one to realize their personal will.

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:13.539
Right?

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.740
Yes.

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.079
I'll make one too.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.420
Learn from Ms. Liu.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.319
I'll make one too.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.319
Yusheng.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.100
About making this will...

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.639
You have to give me some advice.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.139
Sure.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.500
You dictate, and I'll type for you.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.839
Look at Yusheng here.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.639
Ms. Liu.

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:30.560
I'll go wait for you in the room then.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.379
Okay.

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.839
This...

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:33.500
Yusheng, don't run off!

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:35.160
This is really nice.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.500
Thirty-eight years old.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.120
Yusheng.

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:38.939
Overly enthusiastic.

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:42.579
Ms. Liu.

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:44.139
Do you really plan...

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.819
to donate all your assets?

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:46.519
That's right.

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.139
I'm donating it all.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.959
I'm not leaving a single thing for you lot.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.319
Yes, donating it all.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.339
So who do you plan to donate to?

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:56.100
Donate to whom?

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:58.319
To my grandson's school.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.720
Right.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.160
To my alma mater.

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.939
Yes.

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.959
He hasn't started school yet.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.779
I can pay for him to go to a good school.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.120
I can buy a house in the school district.

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:11.660
I was thinking...

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.620
I want to set up an art fund.

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:15.860
So that talented kids...

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.180
can get an education.

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:19.139
An art fund.

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:19.579
Yes.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.980
Is there anything else to add?

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.620
I'll add one more thing.

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:24.980
My house...

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.500
no matter who gets it...

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.480
it just can't go to that Little fox.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.079
I'm so furious.

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:34.220
That Little fox in our family...

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.720
just to get my house...

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:38.040
all day long...

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.899
drives a wedge between me and my son.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.980
Xiao Cai.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.120
Listen to me.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.459
If we're talking about...

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:45.379
those messy issues in your family...

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.000
if you make a will...

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:48.379
I think there won't be...

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.360
these troubles anymore.

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:50.259
I don't need one.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.899
My own stuff...

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:52.860
I can call the shots.

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:56.519
That's hard to say for sure.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.639
Say, if one day...

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:58.680
you suddenly just...

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:00.480
you know...

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.220
that...

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.819
that thing happens...

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:05.220
then the house goes to your son.

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:06.779
Going to my son is no problem.

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:08.879
As long as it doesn't go to that Little fox.

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:11.720
They're a married couple.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.339
So what if they're married?

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.879
That's exactly why...

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:19.720
this is the benefit of making a will.

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:20.899
It's down in black and white.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.259
You write it out clearly.

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:23.439
Then nothing will go wrong.

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:26.199
Yusheng!

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.839
Yusheng!

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:27.220
Auntie Cai.

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:28.019
Hurry up.

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:28.720
Hurry up and help...

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:29.980
Auntie Cai write a will.

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:30.680
You want to write one too?

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.540
I promise to introduce you to a great partner.

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:35.399
Please don't, Auntie Cai.

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:35.860
You...

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:37.480
I'll help you write the will.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.779
But you have to promise me...

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.139
stop setting me up on dates.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.519
On that matter...

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.399
I really can't promise.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.920
Professor Fan

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.779
Eat more vegetables

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.379
Green is lucky for you

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:03.240
Thanks

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.839
You should eat more eggs

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:05.360
Good for the brain

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.620
There's no audience here

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:11.560
It's no fun for us to bicker

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:13.079
You can say that again

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.199
Ms. Liu stays cooped up in her room all day

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:17.439
And who knows what Auntie Cai has been busy with lately

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:18.300
Auntie Cai

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.139
Auntie Cai

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:19.819
Sit here

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.639
No time

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.379
Speak of the devil

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.060
Old Fan

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:27.139
About what I told you the other day

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:28.579
About my cousin's daughter

00:07:29.519 --> 00:07:30.519
What cousin's daughter?

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:33.300
My third sister's girl

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:35.680
The one I asked you to find a husband for

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:38.860
That cousin's daughter of yours, right?

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.139
There's no one suitable

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:42.839
This kind of matchmaking business

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.420
Is Auntie Cai's specialty

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:45.699
True

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:47.540
Auntie Cai is too busy

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:48.540
I don't know if she

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.699
Has time for our business

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:50.120
Yeah

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:51.500
Don't give me that

00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:52.560
I am extremely busy right now

00:07:53.019 --> 00:07:53.779
The matchmaking agency

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:54.759
Is temporarily closed

00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:57.019
Sit here and eat

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.040
The food will get cold if you take it back

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:00.639
Let go

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.100
I'm really busy

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.339
Busy with what?

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:05.339
This cafeteria without Ms. Liu

00:08:05.579 --> 00:08:06.139
And with you here

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:08.180
Just lacks warmth

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.459
You can say that again

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:11.040
Just looking at Old Li

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.959
Makes me lose my appetite

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.600
What are you saying?

00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:16.279
I want to puke when I see you

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.160
I want to puke even more

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.139
Fine

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.120
I don't have time to listen to you two squabble

00:08:20.259 --> 00:08:21.160
I need to hurry back

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.279
To continue working on that will

00:08:22.459 --> 00:08:23.259
Wait

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:23.819
Wait a minute

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:26.259
Since you mentioned the will

00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:28.699
Can the two of us ask

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:30.240
How Ms. Liu's will is coming along?

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.360
Ms. Liu's will is finished

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.539
Spill it

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:36.500
What does the will say?

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:38.879
Did she mention me?

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:40.960
Why would she mention you?

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.720
What a joke. Why would she mention you?

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.580
Did she mention me?

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:47.419
You two are hilarious

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:51.019
In Ms. Liu's will

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.080
Regarding the two of you

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.700
Not a single word was mentioned

00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:01.879
Ms. Liu's will shows true caliber

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.779
What caliber?

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:04.820
She said

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.220
She wants to donate all her assets

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.200
To her alma mater

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:10.940
To establish a... what was it called?

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:11.940
Something-something fund

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.179
Scholarship

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:13.759
Right

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:16.159
I knew it

00:09:16.299 --> 00:09:17.980
Ms. Liu's caliber is just high

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:18.799
Can you compare?

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:20.240
Why can't I compare?

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.419
Compare what? You?

00:09:21.419 --> 00:09:21.960
I'm also planning to...

00:09:22.059 --> 00:09:22.840
Look

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.360
I'm going back

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.159
I'm not staying here with you

00:09:24.159 --> 00:09:24.659
While you two argue

00:09:24.659 --> 00:09:25.480
You two keep arguing

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.039
Argue! Fight it out!

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.320
The old lady has challenged us

00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:32.779
If that's the case

00:09:33.659 --> 00:09:34.840
I should go back immediately too

00:09:36.019 --> 00:09:36.840
What are you going to do?

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.539
I'm going to match Ms. Liu's caliber

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:40.960
I won't muddle along

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.960
Wasting time with you anymore

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.000
I'll compete too

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.340
It's just caliber

00:09:55.059 --> 00:09:56.440
I have to see yours first.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:56.820
You...

00:09:56.899 --> 00:09:57.820
Why should you see mine first?

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.679
Even a will,

00:09:58.799 --> 00:09:59.759
you want to plagiarize?

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.240
I want to see how far behind you are.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:02.919
So I can help you.

00:10:02.919 --> 00:10:03.299
What?

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.419
Don't fight!

00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:07.480
You two are hurting the unity here.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.399
How about...

00:10:10.259 --> 00:10:11.320
you look at mine first?

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.500
You wrote a will too?

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.179
All the seniors here are writing wills now.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:19.100
We're following the example of...

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.039
Ms. Liu from Changqing Residence.

00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:23.899
Ms. Liu writing a will...

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.399
how did you all find out?

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:26.759
Little Cai said so.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.320
Little Cai, that loudspeaker.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.759
Once she knows,

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.820
the whole community...

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.440
doesn't everyone know?

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.299
Right, exactly.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.259
The People's Commune broadcaster.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.779
"When I leave this world..."

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.220
"...take my own self's..."

00:10:40.659 --> 00:10:41.460
No, this won't do.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.259
You even put Beijing...

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.740
our local slang in there.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.399
This colloquialism...

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:45.799
Let me see this...

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:50.519
I've decided that when that day comes

00:10:50.759 --> 00:10:52.779
Probably a hundred years from now

00:10:53.659 --> 00:10:55.120
You've certainly set that date far in the future

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.159
A hundred years from now

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.120
Clinging to this dazzling world

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.059
Lacks caliber

00:10:59.059 --> 00:10:59.559
I say

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:00.519
Well

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.120
Let's see your caliber then, Little Li

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.799
Watch me

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:06.139
My caliber is way too high

00:11:06.419 --> 00:11:08.620
I can't leave a single cent to her

00:11:08.799 --> 00:11:10.019
That Little fox

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:10.779
Auntie Cai

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.019
Words like "Little fox"

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:14.440
Let's not write that in

00:11:14.539 --> 00:11:15.860
A will needs to be formal

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.259
Did I say Little fox?

00:11:17.539 --> 00:11:18.259
Hu Xiaoli

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.080
Hu Xiaoli

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:19.559
Fine

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.679
Write this down too

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.019
Asks what's for dinner the moment she walks in

00:11:24.379 --> 00:11:25.779
Crosses her legs

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.879
Just waiting to be served

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:30.500
Like you've been busy all day

00:11:30.659 --> 00:11:32.059
Like you're the only one who's tired, right?

00:11:32.059 --> 00:11:32.399
No

00:11:32.419 --> 00:11:34.019
And she's eyeing my apartment

00:11:34.019 --> 00:11:35.059
In her dreams!

00:11:35.059 --> 00:11:35.860
Auntie Cai

00:11:35.879 --> 00:11:37.000
Which sentence should I write?

00:11:37.039 --> 00:11:37.659
Write it all down

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.000
Xiao Cai

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.340
Don't get agitated

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.840
Don't rush the kid

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.220
I'm not rushing him

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.460
Yusheng, no rush, here

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.179
Have some water first

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.179
Thank you, Ms. Liu

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.220
Write this down

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:47.899
This sentence is especially important

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.500
Especially important

00:11:48.679 --> 00:11:49.059
Important

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.360
In case

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.580
The two of them get divorced

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:52.799
The grandson

00:11:53.019 --> 00:11:54.840
Must go to my son

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.460
About this

00:11:56.659 --> 00:11:57.539
Auntie Cai

00:11:57.799 --> 00:11:59.340
Your will doesn't have the final say

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.360
The court will consider everything

00:12:01.539 --> 00:12:03.159
The parents' income

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:04.659
And the child's wishes

00:12:04.659 --> 00:12:05.899
I don't have the final say?

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.960
Who has the final say?

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.120
That's funny

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.879
I'll be gone by then, right?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.539
Our ancestors had a saying

00:12:11.779 --> 00:12:12.740
The dead are the greatest

00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:13.360
Right?

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:13.679
Yes

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.139
Also

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.059
Add another one, add

00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:16.379
Supplement

00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:17.539
Add a clause

00:12:17.539 --> 00:12:18.299
Write it like this

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.419
If the Little fox

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.740
Hu Xiaoli

00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:25.159
Gets rid of her bad habits

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.820
I can give her a way out

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.360
And consider letting her live in my apartment

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.879
She's already living in your apartment right now

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.100
Exactly.

00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:42.539
The key lies in this sentence.

00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:43.340
Let me see yours.

00:12:44.259 --> 00:12:46.019
I have decided that in the near future,

00:12:46.019 --> 00:12:47.279
upon my departure from this world,

00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:49.759
I will donate my over eight million to my hometown

00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:51.460
and our retirement community.

00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:52.860
Caliber.

00:12:53.159 --> 00:12:54.379
That's great.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.279
Grandpa Li, have you decided

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.460
when you're going to donate?

00:12:57.559 --> 00:12:58.259
What's that supposed to mean?

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.159
Are you hoping for my early death or something?

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:00.860
No.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.539
That's not what I meant.

00:13:01.539 --> 00:13:02.539
The problem is,

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.139
do you have eight million?

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.559
Whether I have eight million isn't important.

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:09.379
The key is the caliber.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.460
Can you catch up?

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.879
Do I even need to catch up?

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.419
I plan to hand over my ten million

00:13:14.539 --> 00:13:16.159
entirely to the state.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.960
This caliber is leagues ahead of yours.

00:13:18.139 --> 00:13:20.139
Do you have ten million?

00:13:21.019 --> 00:13:22.279
Intellectual property!

00:13:22.539 --> 00:13:24.080
My life's work,

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.980
translations, copyrights,

00:13:26.059 --> 00:13:27.519
and all sorts of spiritual wealth.

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:28.980
It's worth more than ten million!

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.519
My god.

00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:32.919
He's just bluffing with us here.

00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:35.679
You couldn't possibly understand.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.879
I'm going to see Ms. Liu.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.460
She will correctly evaluate

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.179
the caliber of my will.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.600
You stop right there.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.700
I'm going with you.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.100
This...

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:47.980
what's going on?

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:49.100
Just blowing hot air.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.220
Won't admit the truth.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:53.980
It's just...

00:13:54.039 --> 00:13:54.919
that house,

00:13:55.019 --> 00:13:56.679
I'll leave it directly to my grandson.

00:13:57.059 --> 00:13:58.159
If I leave it to my son,

00:13:58.159 --> 00:13:58.720
wouldn't that be the same as

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.879
leaving it to that Little fox?

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.720
But before your grandson comes of age,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
his parents are still his legal guardians.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.580
What does that mean?

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.419
It means this house

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.500
will still be under your daughter-in-law, the Little fox,

00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:12.019
Hu Xiaoli's control.

00:14:12.539 --> 00:14:13.580
No way.

00:14:13.659 --> 00:14:14.580
That won't do.

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:15.139
That won't do.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.059
This...

00:14:16.139 --> 00:14:16.559
Um...

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.120
Yusheng,

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.580
hurry and think of an idea for Auntie Cai.

00:14:18.659 --> 00:14:20.000
How can we get this

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.519
legal guardian removed for her?

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.399
Removed?

00:14:23.019 --> 00:14:24.720
You want me to go be an assassin?

00:14:25.759 --> 00:14:26.440
Auntie Cai,

00:14:26.539 --> 00:14:27.620
don't worry.

00:14:28.379 --> 00:14:29.980
It's not like once we finish writing this,

00:14:30.059 --> 00:14:31.480
the house belongs to them immediately.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.299
This is a dictated will.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.899
We still need to find witnesses

00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:37.659
to prove you are of sound mind and not under duress.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.240
Aren't you all witnesses?

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.059
Aren't you all watching?

00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:40.940
No, we...

00:14:41.139 --> 00:14:43.279
You need to find professional lawyers and notaries.

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:44.179
Only then is it reasonable and legal.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.879
It's that much trouble?

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:48.840
It is that much trouble.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.000
Come in. What's going on here?

00:14:50.039 --> 00:14:50.860
Come here.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.700
Ms. Liu,

00:14:52.379 --> 00:14:53.740
look at the caliber of what I wrote.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.299
No.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.679
My will.

00:14:56.139 --> 00:14:56.899
Look at mine first.

00:14:56.899 --> 00:14:57.980
You fight over everything.

00:14:58.019 --> 00:14:58.860
Then let Yusheng have a look.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:14:59.259
Okay.

00:14:59.759 --> 00:15:01.340
Is there no first come, first served here?

00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:03.580
Yusheng has already written half of mine.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.139
No, we know how to write.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.419
We just want you to judge.

00:15:06.419 --> 00:15:07.440
See whose writing is better.

00:15:07.659 --> 00:15:09.059
Look at our caliber.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.940
Let me show you.

00:15:11.639 --> 00:15:14.559
I decided to donate all my savings

00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:16.379
to the Sanjiang region.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.419
Where?

00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:18.539
Sanjiang.

00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:20.059
Just Sanjiang.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:21.360
Well...

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:22.620
The term "Sanjiang"

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:24.259
first appeared in the Warring States period,

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.379
found in the Book of Documents.

00:15:26.299 --> 00:15:26.960
Showing off again.

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:28.980
The modern Sanjiang refers to

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:29.840
the Yangtze River,

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:30.720
the Yellow River,

00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:32.019
and the Lancang River.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.480
Alright, stop showing off.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.820
The Sanjiang I'm talking about

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.779
is from when I was in the Corps,

00:15:36.779 --> 00:15:37.840
the Sanjiang Plain.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.279
That is the Northeast's Sanjiang.

00:15:40.379 --> 00:15:43.620
It refers to the Heilongjiang, Songhua, and Wusuri Rivers.

00:15:44.139 --> 00:15:45.259
I know that.

00:15:45.679 --> 00:15:46.399
But in the future,

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:47.659
the person reading this document

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.039
might not necessarily know.

00:15:50.019 --> 00:15:51.240
Yusheng, do you know?

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.139
I...

00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:53.519
Grandpa Li,

00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:54.779
my geography isn't very good.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.399
The Sanjiang I'm talking about

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.519
isn't the Sanjiang that flows into the sea.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:01.440
It flows into...

00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:02.279
Me...

00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:05.179
There.

00:16:05.299 --> 00:16:06.460
It flowed into the computer.

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:14.059
It's all your fault.

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:16.580
You just had to compare your caliber with Ms. Liu.

00:16:16.659 --> 00:16:17.779
You have the nerve to blame me?

00:16:17.779 --> 00:16:19.259
If you hadn't knocked over the teacup...

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.240
...and flooded her computer...

00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:21.620
...would we have been kicked out?

00:16:21.659 --> 00:16:24.039
If you hadn't shown off your Warring States knowledge...

00:16:24.159 --> 00:16:25.980
...would I have needed to argue about the Three Rivers?

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.460
If I hadn't argued about the Three Rivers...

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.539
...would that cup have tipped over?

00:16:28.559 --> 00:16:29.419
If the cup hadn't tipped over...

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:30.559
...this whole thing...

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.460
...is all on you.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.279
You were the one who wanted to compare caliber.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.100
And now you're blaming me.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:34.899
Look at you...

00:16:36.279 --> 00:16:38.559
Why are you two arguing again?

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.539
Learn from me.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:42.720
Look at the two of you.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.419
Arguing every day.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.679
Look at us two.

00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:47.779
Happy every day.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.360
Who are you calling a dog?

00:16:50.899 --> 00:16:51.480
Well...

00:16:51.799 --> 00:16:52.860
You're with an old...

00:16:53.059 --> 00:16:54.159
What are you fussing about?

00:16:54.259 --> 00:16:55.659
Gou'er Ye, we aren't arguing.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.039
We're making our wills.

00:16:57.399 --> 00:16:58.740
Going to the underworld?

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.399
You're going to the underworld together?

00:17:02.539 --> 00:17:03.320
What are you talking about?

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.240
Old man.

00:17:04.299 --> 00:17:05.240
We are...

00:17:05.519 --> 00:17:06.720
...making wills.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.000
Not going to the underworld.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.460
We'll go to the underworld after making the wills.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.920
Stop mixing things up.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.200
Gou'er Ye.

00:17:13.539 --> 00:17:14.019
We...

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:15.619
...have to get this will written properly...

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:17.539
...so we can go to the underworld in peace.

00:17:18.299 --> 00:17:20.440
So how do you make a will?

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:22.099
You write down what you care about most...

00:17:22.259 --> 00:17:23.339
...what you can't let go of...

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:24.420
...write it all down.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.119
Close your eyes, kick the bucket...

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:29.480
...and let it all go.

00:17:31.299 --> 00:17:32.720
Let it go.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.640
He actually gets it.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.339
Yeah.

00:17:39.779 --> 00:17:41.140
Is it fixed yet?

00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:43.220
If it's fixed, we can continue writing.

00:17:43.539 --> 00:17:45.119
It's usable now...

00:17:45.259 --> 00:17:46.960
...but what we wrote before...

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.039
...wasn't saved.

00:17:48.099 --> 00:17:49.119
We have to rewrite it.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.200
So all my cursing at the Little fox was for nothing?

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.980
Auntie Cai.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.380
We're writing a will...

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.380
...not to curse people.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.039
It's for...

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:58.799
...the children.

00:17:59.339 --> 00:18:00.480
I know.

00:18:00.839 --> 00:18:02.099
Auntie Cai understands the logic.

00:18:02.299 --> 00:18:05.119
I just wanted to vent for a moment.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:05.980
How about this?

00:18:06.079 --> 00:18:07.359
I'll curse as hard as I can...

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.579
...and you write it down gently.

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:10.000
Alright.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.160
That Little fox...

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.140
If it weren't for back then...

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.599
...when her mother and I...

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:18.099
I...

00:18:19.259 --> 00:18:20.720
You scared me to death!

00:18:20.819 --> 00:18:21.640
What are you doing?

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.579
You're a big old...

00:18:23.319 --> 00:18:24.259
...grown man.

00:18:24.259 --> 00:18:26.359
You just walked in without knocking!

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.480
I'm looking for the college student.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.660
No matter who you're looking for, you have to knock!

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.720
This is a girls' dormitory...

00:18:32.759 --> 00:18:33.440
Grandpa Gou'er.

00:18:33.799 --> 00:18:35.000
What do you need me for?

00:18:35.079 --> 00:18:38.000
I want you to help me check this will...

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.059
...to see if it's written okay.

00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:40.319
Great, another line-cutter.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:42.700
Auntie Cai.

00:18:43.099 --> 00:18:45.539
Yours definitely won't be finished anytime soon.

00:18:45.599 --> 00:18:46.279
How about...

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.740
...I check Grandpa Gou'er's first?

00:18:47.799 --> 00:18:49.160
Then we can write yours properly.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:49.940
Is that okay with you?

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:50.880
It has to be okay...

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.579
...whether I like it or not.

00:18:51.579 --> 00:18:52.099
Look.

00:18:55.599 --> 00:18:55.900
Sir,

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:56.579
Please sit.

00:18:57.259 --> 00:18:58.000
Gou'er Ye.

00:18:58.579 --> 00:19:00.579
I understand what you mean here.

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:02.339
But I don't understand this clause.

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:04.180
This heir of yours...

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.099
Who is "Little Dog"?

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.480
Formal documents require real names.

00:19:08.539 --> 00:19:09.880
And ID numbers too.

00:19:10.099 --> 00:19:11.920
What "Little Dog"?

00:19:12.079 --> 00:19:12.460
You...

00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:15.099
Little Dog is Little Dog.

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:15.819
You know?

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.019
Where am I supposed to get an ID for it?

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.279
It's a dog!

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:21.940
You want to leave a will for a dog?

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:22.960
Come on.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.339
Stand up. One, two, three, go.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:26.740
Come.

00:19:27.579 --> 00:19:29.119
The main gate is right there, right?

00:19:29.859 --> 00:19:31.440
One, two, one.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.519
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:19:36.579 --> 00:19:37.680
To the right.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.039
To the right.

00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:39.000
Keep going right.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.420
And you'll be home.

00:19:42.579 --> 00:19:43.640
Hurry up.

00:19:44.079 --> 00:19:44.559
Hurry.

00:19:44.599 --> 00:19:45.240
Forget him. Let's...

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.720
Continue cursing that little fox.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.180
Come on.

00:19:52.079 --> 00:19:52.680
Today,

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.599
I'm treating Yusheng to a meal.

00:19:55.119 --> 00:19:55.839
Because...

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.539
This child did me a huge favor.

00:19:58.559 --> 00:19:59.960
He helped me complete...

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:00.980
The will.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:01.799
This way,

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:02.640
I can...

00:20:02.839 --> 00:20:04.240
Spite that little fox.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.660
Auntie Cai,

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.019
Don't say that.

00:20:07.099 --> 00:20:08.299
That's not it.

00:20:09.579 --> 00:20:10.500
I know.

00:20:10.839 --> 00:20:12.220
I'm just venting.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.740
We still have to...

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.240
Use the weapon of law, right?

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.779
That will hasn't taken effect yet.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.519
What's there to fear?

00:20:20.259 --> 00:20:21.940
I've already sent it to my son.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.359
I'll spite you, you little fox.

00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:26.039
Who is it?

00:20:26.099 --> 00:20:28.000
Who is a little fox?

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:32.819
I...

00:20:32.859 --> 00:20:33.740
Am called Hu Xiaoli.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.079
Not Little Fox.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:37.700
Chen Xiaobao.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.259
Come in! What are you hiding for?

00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:40.539
Scared of your own mother?

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.539
I'm not hiding.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.940
It's just that...

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.619
You guys...

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.359
Why...

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.059
Did you come so late?

00:20:49.299 --> 00:20:50.380
Is it late?

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.160
We saw that thing you sent...

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.559
The will.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:55.720
And came over immediately.

00:20:55.819 --> 00:20:56.960
Didn't dare delay for a moment.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.259
You saw it, right?

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.500
You know how tough this old lady is now, right?

00:21:05.299 --> 00:21:07.059
Came to beg for mercy, right?

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.079
Look at what you're saying.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.359
We can't thank you enough.

00:21:12.299 --> 00:21:13.500
Thank me?

00:21:14.059 --> 00:21:15.359
Thank me for what?

00:21:15.839 --> 00:21:17.579
Thank you for leaving that house...

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.339
To your eldest grandson.

00:21:20.079 --> 00:21:21.460
Who is your eldest grandson?

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.220
He is my own flesh and blood.

00:21:24.599 --> 00:21:25.660
Think about it.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.900
Who does your grandson listen to?

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.839
I raised my grandson single-handedly.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.359
Of course he listens to me.

00:21:32.839 --> 00:21:33.319
Is that so?

00:21:33.779 --> 00:21:34.900
Really?

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.420
That's hilarious.

00:21:37.579 --> 00:21:38.579
Please look over here.

00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:39.960
This is your eldest son, right?

00:21:40.019 --> 00:21:41.500
You raised him single-handedly too, right?

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.740
Who does he listen to now?

00:21:44.819 --> 00:21:45.799
Chen Dabao.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.099
Am I the only one talking?

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.460
Say a few words to your dear mother too.

00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:52.099
Aren't you quite talkative at home?

00:21:52.099 --> 00:21:54.000
Come on, say it to your mom's face.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:21:59.759
Mom,

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.319
you...

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.839
You really need to rest.

00:22:03.839 --> 00:22:04.539
Mom, look at you...

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.380
Is that the line?

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.779
Is that the line?

00:22:07.779 --> 00:22:08.960
What did I tell you at home?

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.799
There are so many people here.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:16.740
Fine.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.819
You all get to be the good guys,

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.339
and I'm the only bad guy, right?

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.640
No one said that.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.720
Right, we didn't say that.

00:22:25.339 --> 00:22:26.559
Save it, old man.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.339
My "good" mother-in-law here,

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.180
badmouths me to you every day.

00:22:30.579 --> 00:22:31.900
You think I don't know?

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.180
I work from dawn to dusk every day.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.220
What am I after?

00:22:35.579 --> 00:22:36.339
Isn't it all for

00:22:36.339 --> 00:22:38.240
the Chen family's eldest grandson?

00:22:39.519 --> 00:22:42.240
Saying I'm eyeing your houses.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.700
That's hilarious.

00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:46.599
If you're so tough, don't give them to anyone.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:47.900
Take all that fortune of yours

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.779
to the grave with you.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.759
Chen Dabao!

00:22:52.819 --> 00:22:54.200
Let's go. Come home.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.279
Wait...

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:57.960
Mom, we're leaving.

00:23:02.319 --> 00:23:03.119
Yusheng.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.079
That will...

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.319
it's settled.

00:23:07.819 --> 00:23:08.880
Scrap it and start over.

00:23:11.799 --> 00:23:13.900
People raise sons to support them in old age.

00:23:14.839 --> 00:23:15.900
But for me,

00:23:16.099 --> 00:23:18.440
I have to guard against my son in old age.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.740
Auntie Cai, that will you wrote is really...

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.980
Anyway, anyone who reads it would lose it.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.160
However,

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.859
the kid was also in the heat of the moment.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.039
Even in the heat of the moment,

00:23:32.079 --> 00:23:34.579
you can't talk to your elders like that.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:36.559
Auntie Cai,

00:23:37.019 --> 00:23:38.759
this is actually my fault too.

00:23:39.079 --> 00:23:40.740
I pretended to be an expert with half-baked knowledge.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.059
I invited a student from the law department

00:23:43.059 --> 00:23:43.819
to come over tomorrow

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.799
and explain to us

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:45.440
how a will

00:23:45.539 --> 00:23:46.519
should be made.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.119
A law student?

00:23:48.119 --> 00:23:48.920
Male or female?

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.720
Seeing anyone?

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.019
Oh, Auntie Cai.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:56.420
Gou'er Ye.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.759
Grandpa Fan.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.119
Grandpa Li.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:01.579
Hello.

00:24:04.599 --> 00:24:05.319
Hello.

00:24:05.519 --> 00:24:06.420
Really nice.

00:24:07.079 --> 00:24:07.900
You haven't even looked at it yet.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.000
How is it nice?

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.259
I mean you look really nice.

00:24:13.759 --> 00:24:14.839
Do you have a boyfriend?

00:24:14.839 --> 00:24:15.960
Auntie Cai, hold on a second.

00:24:17.859 --> 00:24:19.000
Can you take a look at ours?

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:19.980
And see what other problems there are?

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.079
Student Xiao Fang, tell us about all of them together.

00:24:22.579 --> 00:24:23.400
Grandpa Li,

00:24:23.759 --> 00:24:25.940
the main problem with yours is

00:24:26.819 --> 00:24:28.940
the fabrication of personal assets.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.059
This...

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:31.940
a will, you see,

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.759
must involve real, legal personal assets.

00:24:36.099 --> 00:24:36.900
Actually, I...

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.819
I mainly wanted to highlight my caliber.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.539
That doesn't matter.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.160
I'm in the prime of my life.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.240
I can still earn more.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.440
You can still earn?

00:24:45.539 --> 00:24:47.000
You get dizzy just turning around now.

00:24:48.759 --> 00:24:50.819
Grandpa Fan, your issues aren't major.

00:24:51.079 --> 00:24:52.039
It's mainly that

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.640
the copyright mentioned in the will...

00:24:54.859 --> 00:24:56.200
the moral rights within it

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.400
cannot be inherited.

00:24:57.579 --> 00:24:58.539
It's hollow, isn't it?

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.299
But this copyright

00:25:00.299 --> 00:25:01.319
can be transferred to

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.779
the administrative department for protection.

00:25:04.839 --> 00:25:05.960
College girl,

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.720
tell me about mine too.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:09.359
Gou'er Ye,

00:25:09.819 --> 00:25:10.619
I'm sorry,

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:11.299
well...

00:25:11.359 --> 00:25:12.259
our country doesn't yet have

00:25:12.259 --> 00:25:14.859
regulations regarding wills left to pets.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.680
This is my son!

00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:19.380
He's almost...

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.180
he's almost ten years old.

00:25:21.559 --> 00:25:23.480
You see, I'm afraid that one day...

00:25:24.059 --> 00:25:25.160
if I go before him,

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.240
there won't even be anyone to feed him.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.140
Grandpa Gou'er,

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.220
you don't need to make a will.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.319
If that day really comes,

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:32.380
I'll take care of the dog.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.519
I can do it too.

00:25:33.839 --> 00:25:34.700
Really?

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:35.259
Really.

00:25:35.819 --> 00:25:36.779
Then on behalf of...

00:25:37.019 --> 00:25:38.480
I have to thank you on behalf of your Uncle Dog.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.079
Thank you, my big nephew.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.220
What's this uncle and nephew stuff?

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.460
This is my son.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.460
Isn't that right?

00:25:47.519 --> 00:25:48.799
In terms of generation,

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.460
shouldn't you call him Uncle?

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.900
If there's nothing else,

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.099
I'll be heading back now.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.420
Wait a moment.

00:25:57.779 --> 00:25:58.980
You told me to wait earlier.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.240
It should be my turn now, right?

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:00.880
That's enough.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.420
Honestly.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:02.299
Young lady,

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.079
do you have a boyfriend or not?

00:26:04.119 --> 00:26:05.140
If you don't,

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.359
what do you think of our Yusheng?

00:26:06.359 --> 00:26:07.220
Look, him right there.

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:07.859
Here we go again.

00:26:07.859 --> 00:26:08.019
Here we go again.

00:26:08.559 --> 00:26:09.000
He...

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.059
is such a handsome boy.
