WEBVTT

02:21.180 --> 02:23.820
- Stay comfortable, Colonel.
- Thank you.

02:25.540 --> 02:28.780
I don't hide from you that I'm
very happy to have you by my side.

02:29.580 --> 02:33.540
This company perhaps
it is the most risky of my life

02:33.700 --> 02:36.100
And I just want people
trusted with me.

02:36.540 --> 02:39.940
They are aware of all slander
that they say on your account.

02:40.780 --> 02:44.020
It is said that in Türkiye
You have become of Muslim faith

02:44.340 --> 02:46.540
And that you fought under false name.

02:47.020 --> 02:49.260
It only happened once, in truth.

02:49.940 --> 02:51.940
My battle name was Osman Bey.

02:53.380 --> 02:58.500
My officers think that from that country
have taken customs, habits, thoughts.

02:59.340 --> 03:00.780
They consider you ...

03:01.900 --> 03:03.260
... like an extravagant.

03:04.780 --> 03:06.460
Why do they have a lot with you?

03:08.020 --> 03:11.020
- Because they are not like them.
- that is, how are you?

03:11.100 --> 03:17.620
A free man in the service of freedom
wherever it is necessary to defend it.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.340
I'm here, because I believe as you too,
that the time has come...

03:21.420 --> 03:24.220
to hunt those who hold hostage
South and Italy.

03:24.460 --> 03:27.180
Yes, but the mail
is played in Sicily...

03:27.460 --> 03:31.820
and the voices that come from there
they are conflicting. What do you know?

03:32.900 --> 03:36.220
I believe in the Sicilians
who speak little,

03:37.580 --> 03:40.540
In those who run inside,
they suffer.

03:41.220 --> 03:45.580
It is a people which is revealed
above all in the silences,

03:46.020 --> 03:48.260
...in the words he does not say.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.260
Good morning.

04:15.900 --> 04:17.540
- Tricò Domenico?
- Sissignor.

04:17.660 --> 04:20.259
- It was Antonino Pio.
- Tell us about your insulting leg.

04:20.379 --> 04:23.820
I was a child
And I was working in a mill.

04:24.380 --> 04:26.940
I turned the mill
to pull the water from the well.

04:27.180 --> 04:28.860
One day I stopped that I was tired

04:28.940 --> 04:33.220
And the master gave me a blow
with an iron that launched me forever.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.060
But if there is to run I run.

04:35.260 --> 04:36.980
How did you get on?

04:37.060 --> 04:40.500
I was making my mind. A thousand crafts.
I also did the artificant.

04:41.180 --> 04:44.820
They called me for fire games
in patronal feasts,

04:44.980 --> 04:47.620
Then one day everything went on fire
And they blamed me,

04:47.700 --> 04:49.020
But what did I have to do with it?

04:49.100 --> 04:50.700
And I ran away on the continent.

04:50.860 --> 04:54.220
And I made other jobs
always in patronal feasts.

04:54.420 --> 04:59.100
- Why do you want to return to Sicily?
- Colonel, do you ask me too?

04:59.700 --> 05:00.980
To free it from these cuckolds.

05:01.180 --> 05:02.620
Enlisted.

05:03.660 --> 05:05.100
Thank you.

05:08.580 --> 05:10.260
Thank you.

05:10.420 --> 05:12.420
It is well.

05:15.220 --> 05:17.460
Excuse me, it came from the heart.

05:17.620 --> 05:20.380
Ragusìn,
Do you know how they say in my part?

05:20.540 --> 05:23.500
"The best word is that
that is not said. "

05:23.660 --> 05:25.700
- Ah, yes?
- Yes.

05:26.380 --> 05:28.260
The opposite is true for me.

05:28.460 --> 05:31.700
The word must be clear, like oil

05:31.860 --> 05:34.260
Otherwise you don't understand
anything anymore.

05:35.940 --> 05:38.660
Don't fear, from now on I will
keep the tongue in brake.

05:39.420 --> 05:41.260
Indeed, forgive me.

05:42.780 --> 05:44.340
All right.

05:45.100 --> 05:47.100
Let's go on.

05:56.980 --> 05:58.540
Come on, young man.

06:06.060 --> 06:09.140
You are Marchetti
Bepin aged eleven

06:10.860 --> 06:14.260
- And you would like to enlist with us.
- Yes, Colonel.

06:15.860 --> 06:18.980
But you realize that you are alone
A child. Do you know what awaits you?

06:19.140 --> 06:23.060
- I'm ready for everything for Garibaldi.
- Are you alone?

06:23.260 --> 06:26.460
No, there is also my father.
Marchetti Luigi.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.180
Doctor and patriot.

06:30.340 --> 06:32.660
You have already enrolled it.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.580
Well.

06:34.740 --> 06:36.860
Now you are angreen too.

06:48.660 --> 06:50.060
Thank you.

07:02.460 --> 07:05.500
- Are you the last one?
- it seems to me yes.

07:05.620 --> 07:08.700
- Come on, then, what are you
waiting for? Hurry up. Here I am.

07:25.180 --> 07:28.780
- You are a rosary.
- to serve it.

07:30.940 --> 07:33.780
Here it is written that you were born in Palermo.
Why do you speak in this way?

07:33.860 --> 07:38.100
Colonel, I have gone away for years
from that city and I live here to the north.

07:43.540 --> 07:45.460
but I was Palermo.

07:45.540 --> 07:48.220
If you were Palermo,
You are still and you will always be.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.500
On the other hand, declared here
you have attended

07:50.580 --> 07:53.260
- The Nunziatella military school.
- Yes, of course.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.180
It is necessary that I know well
that school.

07:56.220 --> 07:58.460
I entered it at nine
And I went out to 19.

07:58.540 --> 08:02.820
I also entered as a child, but I was
Forced to go away before time

08:02.980 --> 08:05.380
- Due to a family mourning.
- Your father?

08:05.580 --> 08:09.780
An uncle of mine, Baron.
The only one who could pay the straight line.

08:11.580 --> 08:14.620
Who were your instructors?
Crisanti was still there?

08:14.700 --> 08:18.060
- and how, chrysants. A good person.
- Yes?

08:18.500 --> 08:21.260
- What about Major Salerno?
- He too, an exquisite person.

08:21.380 --> 08:24.860
No, you chrys and Salerno
You can't have known them,

08:25.020 --> 08:28.220
both went away
long before I came.

08:31.020 --> 08:33.740
- Maybe I have been wrong.
- You are certainly wrong.

08:33.900 --> 08:38.339
And tell me, of the discipline of weapons
And there is some notion of shooting?

08:38.580 --> 08:39.859
- A little something.
- Enroll.

08:39.940 --> 08:41.660
- Enrolled?
- Enroll.

08:54.060 --> 08:55.260
Thank you.

09:03.580 --> 09:06.740
Don't do that face, Ragusìn.
With what awaits us,

09:06.820 --> 09:09.060
Even the impostors can be useful.

09:31.660 --> 09:34.100
To read I brought myself
Victor Hugo's poems

09:34.220 --> 09:36.860
for the Palermo nights,
If we ever get there.

09:37.020 --> 09:38.460
We will get there.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.820
Garibaldi has never lost a battle.

09:40.980 --> 09:43.140
But are you not afraid?

09:43.220 --> 09:46.500
Fear? I don't know what it is.

09:46.580 --> 09:51.780
And then, to die to free Sicily
From the Bourbons, huh? And unite Italy ...

09:51.940 --> 09:53.860
That's what we want,
isn't it?

09:54.340 --> 09:55.900
And what do you laugh?

09:56.060 --> 09:58.740
Last night
I arrived that it was already late,

09:58.940 --> 10:01.100
and when I entered
I found an old man

10:01.260 --> 10:04.380
who prayed to his
hands on and cursed ...

10:04.540 --> 10:08.020
Where you go, what he did to you bad
The king of Naples?

10:08.140 --> 10:12.100
What did the Bourbons do you wrong?
Back home, Briganti!

10:12.260 --> 10:14.620
And I, I immediately took the hat

10:15.100 --> 10:16.460
And I made it disappear ...

10:16.940 --> 10:18.060
As.

10:18.900 --> 10:20.140
There he is.

10:20.820 --> 10:21.940
Stupid!

10:32.500 --> 10:35.860
Long live Italy! Long live the king!

10:36.020 --> 10:40.500
Long live Garibaldi! Long live Garibaldi!

10:46.260 --> 10:48.620
Where is the general?

10:48.780 --> 10:51.340
To look for ships
who have to take us to Sicily.

10:51.500 --> 10:55.740
They had to be already here and they
are not there. Let's start well.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.500
But you are really good.

12:08.580 --> 12:10.340
It's luck.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.980
Hey Scemo,
Are you not a magician?

12:13.140 --> 12:15.380
- What do you say?
- Of course yes.

12:15.940 --> 12:19.460
Here they are! Here they are!

12:54.420 --> 12:57.900
Are we all there?
Courage, it passes soon.

13:01.020 --> 13:03.020
"Saveria of my heart,

13:03.100 --> 13:08.220
If God wants, I'm in a ship
that will take me to you.

13:09.060 --> 13:11.620
There is a very ugly time

13:12.100 --> 13:15.660
And the boys are all throwing up.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.860
I only think about you

13:19.020 --> 13:23.180
And I can't wait to hug you again.

13:23.540 --> 13:26.020
The thought of seeing you again

13:26.180 --> 13:29.100
He gives me strength and courage. "

13:30.060 --> 13:31.220
Your…

13:33.780 --> 13:36.020
Do-me ...

13:36.460 --> 13:38.060
ni-co.

13:38.220 --> 13:40.740
To bed and always be stretched out.

13:40.900 --> 13:43.020
I recommend,
you drink little.

13:43.180 --> 13:48.020
My name is Rosa, I'm a fighter
Me too. I come from Savoy

13:48.180 --> 13:52.260
And I'm here because I want too,
Like you, united and free Italy.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.860
Belly up.

14:11.860 --> 14:14.940
- What does a female make us on a ship?
- Pirla,

14:15.100 --> 14:17.220
She is the bride of Crispi.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.940
then, we have
the ball and the cartridge case.

14:33.260 --> 14:34.980
We insert and roll up.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.580
- Eh?
- Let's roll up.

14:36.740 --> 14:38.980
Let's make you taught it the same.

14:39.260 --> 14:41.740
When you hear the ball, close.

14:41.900 --> 14:44.500
- Eh?

14:44.660 --> 14:47.820
Guys, when one closes, closes.
The word itself says it.

14:47.980 --> 14:49.340
Pack ...

14:49.580 --> 14:52.060
We remove this and fill.

14:53.780 --> 14:55.900
Sorry.

14:56.180 --> 15:00.620
I was looking for Domenico Tricò.
He sends me the Lieutenant Ragusìn.

15:00.860 --> 15:02.260
Come on.

15:05.060 --> 15:06.060
Please?

15:06.220 --> 15:08.460
Look, I realized that
you are Sicilian.

15:11.260 --> 15:13.620
Take those bags and
take them here.

15:14.700 --> 15:17.940
- Do I only have
to take them? Yes, just you!

15:22.540 --> 15:25.100
After the dust we close above.

15:25.980 --> 15:27.980
We close tight ...

15:28.420 --> 15:30.260
Kiss to the Bourbons.

15:31.740 --> 15:34.420
Barcino, look that you have to
load them on the shoulders.

15:34.580 --> 15:36.900
And take them here. Do soon.

15:41.820 --> 15:42.820
Here.

15:43.460 --> 15:47.780
With this we do instead
cannon balls for the Bourbons.

15:47.900 --> 15:49.060
Pam!

15:51.980 --> 15:54.780
What are you afraid?
Are you Bourbone?

16:17.900 --> 16:20.220
Colonel, we got skilled.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.660
We arrived! We arrived!

16:24.060 --> 16:25.060
Let's go.

16:26.460 --> 16:27.980
Here it is!

16:29.060 --> 16:30.260
Marsala!

16:30.460 --> 16:32.900
- Is it Marsala?
- Yes, it's Marsala.

16:39.860 --> 16:42.140
- here they are!
- Viva Garibaldi!

16:47.260 --> 16:48.380
Come on! Come on!

17:02.420 --> 17:04.419
On the ground!

17:07.100 --> 17:11.619
Why do you stop? We have to bring
The sheltering cannons to the walls!

17:12.220 --> 17:14.260
On your feet, strength!
Standing, let's go!

17:17.260 --> 17:18.419
But what the fuck ...

17:19.980 --> 17:21.820
Gather to the Navy!

17:38.020 --> 17:39.740
Mind, with me they have it.

18:15.540 --> 18:17.620
- go!
- Ahia!

18:18.060 --> 18:20.140
- Who is? It's me,
what do you do here? Go away.

18:20.260 --> 18:22.980
What you are doing,
I'm running away from this hell.

18:23.140 --> 18:25.780
You are also a deserter, go.

18:26.180 --> 18:28.060
I? Why are you what are you?

18:28.740 --> 18:29.780
Come on, let me enter.

18:29.940 --> 18:33.460
No, this is my hiding place.
Look for another. Horned.

18:33.740 --> 18:36.820
- If they take me, they shoot me.
- And what do I care?

18:37.140 --> 18:38.980
But I swear I first denounce you.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.940
You are a cuckold,
infamous and traitor!

18:46.020 --> 18:48.860
We just miss that they kill me.
Next, enter.

18:50.140 --> 18:51.180
Deserter I?

18:51.340 --> 18:54.420
I who did all the ammunition
For Garibaldi on the steamer.

18:54.620 --> 18:56.460
If it was not for me like
Did he make the war?

18:56.540 --> 18:57.900
Who pulled him, the stones?

18:57.980 --> 19:01.340
Look that I also threw the blood
on that steamer.

19:01.540 --> 19:04.660
With all the bags you made me
Bringing the hernia came to me.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.860
They should give
me the hero medal.

19:08.980 --> 19:10.700
Hero with this face?

19:11.460 --> 19:12.860
You can do the fuck.

19:13.020 --> 19:16.180
Then it means that the Padreno
He put together for this,

19:16.260 --> 19:18.020
Because we look like it.

19:18.380 --> 19:20.740
"Marsala, 11 May.

19:20.900 --> 19:24.420
Landing and despite
the cannonate, no dead. "

19:26.260 --> 19:27.860
No, indeed ...

19:28.260 --> 19:30.580
There is a victim and...
and he is a dog.

19:35.580 --> 19:39.780
There are also two deserters.
However, luck assists us.

19:39.900 --> 19:42.260
Luck counts nothing
For a military.

19:45.620 --> 19:47.620
Luck helps fools.

19:49.420 --> 19:53.780
- "Fortuna Favet Fatuis?"
- Everyone helped us in Marsala.

19:53.940 --> 19:57.780
Men, boys, children.

19:58.300 --> 20:03.500
Even the friars, set aside
The sacraments ran to help us.

20:03.940 --> 20:04.940
All generous!

20:06.660 --> 20:11.420
Veneti, Lombardi, Toscani,
Piedmontese, Emiliani, Ligurian.

20:11.740 --> 20:13.500
All ready to sacrifice yourself!

20:14.100 --> 20:18.020
The only exception, the only shame,
Two Sicilians.

20:19.380 --> 20:21.860
Two miserable beggars!

20:22.180 --> 20:24.220
Two cacasotto deserters

20:24.380 --> 20:26.900
they flee
to the first battle signs

20:27.140 --> 20:30.100
than instead of the blood
they have a spiered shit!

20:36.660 --> 20:37.980
Ragusìn.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.660
- Soon, the name register.
- Yes.

20:42.140 --> 20:44.980
Please God
that you don't make me meet again!

20:54.060 --> 20:55.140
Nobody should know

20:55.220 --> 20:59.540
that those two miserable took part
to our glorious expedition.

21:22.380 --> 21:24.900
- I'm finally free.
- To do that?

21:25.100 --> 21:27.180
I know. I greet you.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.340
But what are you following me?

21:47.500 --> 21:50.020
But when ever.
I'm doing my way.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.140
To go where?

21:51.220 --> 21:52.780
- In Catania.
- In Catania?

21:52.860 --> 21:53.860
Sissignor.

21:53.940 --> 21:55.740
And this, in your opinion,
Is it the road to Catania?

21:55.940 --> 21:57.300
Yes.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.780
But let me be the pleasure.

22:28.100 --> 22:31.060
People of Salemi, citizens,

22:31.700 --> 22:35.900
We landed here
To free the beautiful land of Sicily

22:36.060 --> 22:38.700
by the Borbone oppressor ...

22:43.420 --> 22:47.540
In the name of Vittorio Emanuele,
Constitutional re of Italy.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.500
- Long live the king!
- Viva Garibaldi!

22:53.540 --> 22:58.700
My men will take covered,
Food, cash in the municipal coffers.

22:59.460 --> 23:04.060
My first act of government
it will be abolishing taxes

23:04.180 --> 23:07.780
on salt and bread and ...

23:08.380 --> 23:12.620
divide the landlords
And distribute the earth!

23:12.780 --> 23:14.820
Viva Garibaldi!

23:19.660 --> 23:22.140
From you I expect loyalty and courage.

23:22.820 --> 23:26.100
Account on your help
and on your commitment of patriots.

23:26.420 --> 23:28.780
My lieutenant, Nino Bixio,

23:29.220 --> 23:31.460
It will give you other important communications.

23:31.620 --> 23:33.660
Viva Garibaldi!

23:43.300 --> 23:47.300
I will be short and very clear.

23:47.940 --> 23:48.940
I warn you.

23:50.420 --> 23:53.740
Anyone will not fight
on our side

23:55.060 --> 23:56.980
will be considered a traitor

23:59.260 --> 24:03.380
and will undergo the consequences
of his cowardly gesture.

24:16.140 --> 24:19.220
- Are you still here?
- Do you think you're only hungry?

24:22.260 --> 24:23.740
Floor.

24:24.100 --> 24:25.740
- It is tender.
- Yes.

24:25.900 --> 24:28.500
Three quarters is mine, a quarter is yours.
I saw it before.

24:28.620 --> 24:29.940
Come here.

24:32.860 --> 24:34.060
Floor.

24:38.260 --> 24:39.580
Let's go.

24:40.460 --> 24:41.460
What is it?

24:41.620 --> 24:43.860
What happens? Oh!

24:44.020 --> 24:47.260
Cuckold!
Cornuto and thief, lay the sheep!

24:47.460 --> 24:49.780
- The rifle!
- Escape!

24:50.460 --> 24:52.100
Ouch ...

24:52.380 --> 24:53.820
Let's run away before you recharge!

24:54.020 --> 24:55.700
Children of whore!

25:01.860 --> 25:04.100
There was little to do
that the idioticated one whimped me.

25:04.260 --> 25:05.460
He would have done well.

25:05.620 --> 25:08.220
Anyway, the two of us must
get to agree.

25:08.820 --> 25:11.100
The step I say.
Come behind me.

25:11.260 --> 25:15.140
How beautiful this. I am walking forward
And suddenly I have to come behind you.

25:15.260 --> 25:17.180
Because who said it
What do you have to go on?

25:18.380 --> 25:20.900
- What if I didn't agree?
- You go alone.

25:20.980 --> 25:23.780
Oh well, I come behind you,
But stop now.

25:24.340 --> 25:26.500
I am tired and it lasts my ass.

25:43.900 --> 25:46.060
Can you know where we are going?

25:47.060 --> 25:49.900
I to my country
to marry my girlfriend.

25:50.020 --> 25:51.220
You, I don't know.

25:53.740 --> 25:56.460
For this you were united
at the expense of the thousand.

25:56.540 --> 25:58.260
To take a ride.

25:59.220 --> 26:01.260
And instead you to make Italy united.
It is true?

26:01.380 --> 26:03.740
Italy? But that I care.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.900
Tell me the truth,
Why did you embark on the ship?

26:10.500 --> 26:12.260
To escape from Venice.

26:12.740 --> 26:14.980
Mind, even run away.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.060
And who followed you, thoughts?

26:17.500 --> 26:20.100
An infamous and false accusation.

26:20.900 --> 26:22.620
You kissed with the cards, is it true?

26:23.260 --> 26:24.780
See you sleep.

26:39.940 --> 26:42.140
- Who is?
- Shut up!

26:42.740 --> 26:44.020
Do slowly.

27:12.140 --> 27:13.540
Peace and good, sister.

27:14.020 --> 27:15.860
Can you open me for pleasure?

27:16.260 --> 27:17.820
We are hungry.

27:20.940 --> 27:23.380
What are you doing? They are women.

27:23.700 --> 27:25.260
You have to go there with feeling.

27:25.460 --> 27:27.420
And what should I do,
Do I have to start crying?

27:27.740 --> 27:32.900
Don't worry, there is always a trick.
Now I do something that works safe.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.060
- Meaning what?
- The deaf -mute.

27:37.300 --> 27:39.980
- Do you know how to do the deaf -mute?
- Certain.

27:40.820 --> 27:41.900
We see.

27:48.020 --> 27:49.060
What happens?

27:49.420 --> 27:52.340
Nothing, the poor man was injured.

27:52.500 --> 27:56.780
He cannot speak because he is deaf -mute,
from birth.

27:56.940 --> 27:58.580
Poor.

28:01.260 --> 28:02.860
You see that it worked.

28:04.860 --> 28:09.420
Good morning, Mother Badesssa.
Unfortunately, a fatality was injured.

28:11.140 --> 28:12.660
Where?

28:15.660 --> 28:18.980
Show the mother Badessa
Where did you hurt yourself.

28:19.180 --> 28:21.100
- Now?
- Safe.

28:34.220 --> 28:35.740
Fuck. It is a paradise.

28:36.180 --> 28:38.460
SSH… Remember that you are silent.

29:05.620 --> 29:06.820
At what point are we?

29:06.900 --> 29:08.700
So much is so missing?

29:09.060 --> 29:11.660
It still takes a little patience.

29:11.820 --> 29:14.100
Luckily it was pepper.

29:58.940 --> 29:59.940
Is it scurrile?

30:00.180 --> 30:02.460
It seemed so innocent to me. Excuse me.

30:02.540 --> 30:05.260
Ave, Maria, full of grace,
The Lord is with you.

Lieutenant Colonel?

30:39.260 --> 30:40.580
Of Orsini.

30:41.460 --> 30:43.780
An old acquaintance.

30:49.580 --> 30:52.020
has played
in our Bourbon army

30:52.260 --> 30:53.860
with the degrees of major.

30:54.340 --> 30:57.700
and here it is,
With Garibaldi.

30:58.820 --> 31:03.620
All this to satisfy
its sinister revolutionary ambitions.

31:07.420 --> 31:09.860
It is a vain of the worst species.

31:20.460 --> 31:22.780
Colonel?

31:22.940 --> 31:25.820
- What are we waiting for?
- The general order.

31:57.260 --> 31:59.140
Give the order to the first battalion
to advance.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.740
Play the attack.

32:11.420 --> 32:15.780

35:05.740 --> 35:07.260
Gramaccini?

35:14.820 --> 35:19.020
We gave him a nice wood, though.
Is it true, Colonel?

35:19.340 --> 35:22.540
We won,
But there is nothing to celebrate, lieutenant.

35:23.260 --> 35:24.980
Look around.

35:29.540 --> 35:31.020
Agazzi.

35:34.140 --> 35:35.900

35:54.860 --> 35:57.940
I understand
that I can try every challenge with you.

35:58.420 --> 36:02.380
I had counted on your bayonets
And I didn't deceive myself.

36:02.620 --> 36:06.020
This tells us how much we can do

36:06.100 --> 36:10.100
When the entire Italian family
It will be brought together under one flag.

36:12.620 --> 36:16.620
Friends that generously
they offer us refuge tonight

36:17.660 --> 36:19.580
they give us their sincere wine

36:22.460 --> 36:24.740
and I take this opportunity to make a toast

36:26.060 --> 36:27.860
and tell you thanks.

36:28.460 --> 36:30.340
Prosit.

36:32.940 --> 36:33.940
I feel you.

36:34.460 --> 36:36.220
I know you are there.

36:36.580 --> 36:38.260
Sister Anna, I recognized you.

36:38.380 --> 36:40.460
Here you are. Come here I take you.

36:41.340 --> 36:43.700
Where do you go?

36:43.860 --> 36:45.500
Come here.

36:45.660 --> 36:49.180
I saw you, stop.
Stop, Monella.

36:49.340 --> 36:50.740
I take you to Morsi, where are you?

36:51.060 --> 36:53.820
Stop, I told you stopped!
Come here.

36:53.980 --> 36:55.980
Come here!

36:58.860 --> 37:02.260
Where? I saw you, come here.

37:17.220 --> 37:19.020
Why
Did you throw this card?

37:19.100 --> 37:21.140
Let me do my game,
Sister Agostina.

37:21.260 --> 37:22.740
As you want, Assuntina.

37:22.820 --> 37:24.820
Sister Vittoria has prepared
The usual soup?

37:24.900 --> 37:27.260
- Tennerumi.
- What a hassle.

37:27.340 --> 37:29.660
- She only knows how to do that.
- I know.

37:36.940 --> 37:38.660
What do you want?

37:49.900 --> 37:52.260
He is thirsty this poor man.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.940
Water and mint.

38:05.780 --> 38:07.540
Assuntina ...

38:23.620 --> 38:24.620
Mhm.

38:24.940 --> 38:26.940
- Mhm?
- Mhm.

38:34.860 --> 38:36.500
He wants to play with money.

38:36.820 --> 38:37.940
Mhm.

39:14.020 --> 39:15.820
Mind, this is a cuckold!

39:16.700 --> 39:20.100
Don't be frightened, sister,
So much can hear anything.

39:20.220 --> 39:22.180
I told you that it is deaf, as well as silent.

39:22.300 --> 39:25.260
But you made a double sin
with that word.

39:25.500 --> 39:28.460
For you he sang the rooster of San Pietro.
Chicchirichì.

39:28.740 --> 39:32.180
What do you want to do it?
I took the vice in the family.

39:33.220 --> 39:35.460
My grandfather, good soul.

39:35.860 --> 39:39.980
My father, good soul.
My brothers, good soul.

39:40.620 --> 39:42.700
- The loved cousins ​​...
- Good soul.

39:43.140 --> 39:45.540
They always stayed with cards in hand.

39:45.940 --> 39:48.260
My father with these
He made us live in thirteen.

39:48.460 --> 39:51.500
Then, always for these cursed cards
He died killed.

39:52.020 --> 39:54.140
But you can't hear anything.

39:54.260 --> 39:56.980
Me and Sister Agostina
We are talking to the wall.

39:57.820 --> 40:00.380
Cricco, Crocco and Fiasco's handle.

40:08.460 --> 40:11.060
Tricò, this is paradise.

40:11.860 --> 40:13.460
Shadow, fresh ...

40:14.060 --> 40:15.700
Top quality food.

40:15.860 --> 40:17.580
Morning and evening.

40:18.780 --> 40:20.100
And also some games.

40:20.300 --> 40:21.700
Look here.

40:22.340 --> 40:25.100
Today I collected the begging of the sisters.

40:25.940 --> 40:27.860
Money earned honestly.

40:28.100 --> 40:29.100
Without cheating.

40:29.180 --> 40:32.740
And then there are the eyes of Assuntina
that make you dissolve.

40:32.980 --> 40:35.660
- But why don't we stay here?
- What are you saying?

40:36.260 --> 40:37.860
But when ever? No.

40:38.540 --> 40:40.660
I have to go to the country, I have to get married.

40:41.460 --> 40:44.060
I'm not here
to be enchanted by the fairies.

40:44.180 --> 40:45.740
But that I care about me.

40:46.500 --> 40:49.020
Indeed, I will tell you more.

40:49.180 --> 40:50.620
Tomorrow I greet everyone ...

40:51.020 --> 40:52.140
And I'm leaving.

40:53.620 --> 40:56.500
What is there, Baronetto?
You dumbfounded yourself, huh?

40:56.860 --> 40:57.980
Don't you say anything?

40:58.140 --> 40:59.820
And that I tell you, tricò.

41:00.140 --> 41:03.340
At least you have the hope of a wife,
of a family.

41:03.660 --> 41:05.220
I have nobody.

41:07.060 --> 41:08.820
My family is this.

41:13.140 --> 41:14.820
Goodnight, tricò.

41:15.860 --> 41:17.140
Goodnight, Spita '.

41:29.660 --> 41:33.900
Colonel, it was enough to ask.
I would have done myself immediately.

41:34.820 --> 41:36.740
This is a Turkish coffee, lieutenant.

41:37.340 --> 41:39.900
His preparation is a divinatory art.

41:44.300 --> 41:45.300
Do you want to?

41:47.500 --> 41:48.580
Yes please.

41:48.860 --> 41:51.740
A little clutch, just to like.

42:08.580 --> 42:10.780
Yes, it's true.
The first few times sucks a little.

42:10.860 --> 42:12.180
You have to get used to it.

42:28.020 --> 42:31.420
In Constantinople I learned to read
in coffee funds.

42:32.580 --> 42:34.620
What do you see, Colonel?

42:35.260 --> 42:38.180
I see that the Sicilians will welcome us
as liberators.

42:38.340 --> 42:39.460
Well.

42:39.620 --> 42:42.260
But this is only this
that appears on the surface.

42:42.460 --> 42:47.380
The truth is very different.
Do you see these jagged edges?

42:48.260 --> 42:50.780
Hide a warning.

42:50.940 --> 42:54.100
If I can ask ... which one?

42:55.820 --> 43:00.420
Well, if I told you,
The prediction is not ... it wouldn't be worth, right?

43:42.420 --> 43:47.100
Ave, Maria,
Full of grace, the Lord is with you.

43:47.260 --> 43:49.620
You are blessed among women

43:49.780 --> 43:53.980
And blessed is the fruit of your breast,
Jesus.

43:54.140 --> 43:57.100
Santa Maria, Mother of God,

43:57.260 --> 43:59.860
Pray for us sinners

44:00.020 --> 44:03.860
Now and in the hour of our death,
amen.

44:04.020 --> 44:08.860
Ave, Maria, full of grace,
The Lord is with you.

44:09.020 --> 44:11.780
You are blessed among women

44:11.940 --> 44:14.980
And blessed is the fruit of your breast,
Jesus.

45:02.540 --> 45:04.780
There is a mistake, he is right, sister.

45:04.940 --> 45:07.580
You had a king in his hand,
If you do the account, he wins.

45:10.580 --> 45:12.100
What a scimunita.

45:13.060 --> 45:15.340
I was wrong the accounts, sorry.

45:15.900 --> 45:18.460
Santa Rosalia must forgive me.

45:19.500 --> 45:20.900
Where?

45:21.260 --> 45:22.260
Ah, here you are!

45:22.540 --> 45:24.500
Cornuto, thief, infamous and traitor.

45:24.660 --> 45:27.060
- Where is my money?
- What happened?

45:27.260 --> 45:31.140
You got your eyes immediately.
You have stolen all my savings.

45:31.220 --> 45:33.060
You made your friend,
Instead you are infamous and traitor.

45:33.140 --> 45:35.820
But what are you saying, I have been here.
Ask the sisters.

45:35.980 --> 45:37.820
I told you it was a cuckold!

45:37.980 --> 45:40.700
This filibusiere speaks better than me,
Other than silent.

45:40.860 --> 45:42.500
And you stole all the money!

45:42.660 --> 45:45.340
First it's up to me.
Come here. Where is the money?

45:45.860 --> 45:48.020
Stop! Nobody is fault.

45:48.180 --> 45:51.780
Rosario has always been here,
Then he would never do it. It's too good.

45:51.940 --> 45:53.660
I know who stole your money.

45:53.780 --> 45:56.660
What are you saying? What do you know!

45:56.900 --> 45:57.980
Oh…

45:58.940 --> 46:00.340
There was something between you,

46:00.500 --> 46:03.380
And you were united to steal the money
To me and that other.

46:03.460 --> 46:07.060
What do you say, Sister Agostina?
It was the abbess to steal.

46:07.460 --> 46:10.660
The abbess? What do you say, do you assume?

46:10.780 --> 46:14.460
Yes, she is stronger than her.
The instinct to steal.

46:14.740 --> 46:18.940
You don't know, but I saw it while
He stole the money from the bishop of Caltanisetta.

46:19.060 --> 46:21.820
She wouldn't want to,
It is the devil who pushed it.

46:22.020 --> 46:24.020
I swear on Santa Rita.

46:32.900 --> 46:36.020
Cornuta, false and stinking of a nun.

46:36.260 --> 46:38.860
You stole your money
Of a poor unfortunate like me?

46:39.060 --> 46:41.020
Where did you put them? Where did you hide them?

46:41.220 --> 46:43.180
Tell me, where did you hide them?

46:43.260 --> 46:45.420
Where did you hide them? Where are they?

46:45.500 --> 46:48.900
- Where are they?
- What do you want?

46:49.020 --> 46:50.660
Where are they?

46:50.900 --> 46:53.260
- Do you have it below?
- No! What?

46:53.420 --> 46:54.540
You have them below!

46:54.620 --> 46:56.220
You have it below.

46:56.340 --> 46:58.140
Where did you put them? Where did you hide them?

46:58.260 --> 47:00.260
Damm them, tell me where they are!

47:02.460 --> 47:03.620
Come here!

47:04.220 --> 47:05.220
Stay back!

47:05.500 --> 47:07.380
Stay back! Stay back!

47:07.580 --> 47:09.620
- Let's go away!
- My money has stolen!

47:09.700 --> 47:11.260
My money has stolen!

47:11.460 --> 47:14.020
My money has stolen!

47:21.420 --> 47:23.620
Mind, how many are.

47:27.060 --> 47:29.820
Sisters, peace is with all of us.

47:29.980 --> 47:33.140
Care them out, these cuckolds!

47:33.340 --> 47:34.820
Floor!

47:35.140 --> 47:36.860
Piano, I'm lame!

47:42.380 --> 47:43.780
Floor!

47:43.940 --> 47:45.420
Piano, which are lame!

47:45.620 --> 47:47.620
Shame! Infamous!

47:48.700 --> 47:51.460
Other than the door of paradise,
This is the door of hell!

47:51.580 --> 47:54.540
These are not nuns, they are devils!

47:55.420 --> 47:56.660
Finish it.

47:57.140 --> 47:59.420
The prickly pear ice cream ...
poison was.

47:59.700 --> 48:01.460
Think about your girlfriend waiting for you.

48:01.540 --> 48:04.060
But if I'm naked like a worm,
All the money stole me.

48:04.140 --> 48:06.500
I talk to us with your girlfriend,
Just calm down.

48:06.660 --> 48:07.660
I'm calm.

48:07.740 --> 48:09.180
- So are you calm?
- So I'm calm.

48:09.260 --> 48:12.660
- So are you calm?
- When they are calm I'm like that, let's go!

48:14.700 --> 48:16.900
Get up before I get pissed off!

48:55.180 --> 48:58.860
♪ You wake up with the Sol d'Api ... ♪

49:20.380 --> 49:22.980
- Have you seen the Colonel?
- It's up to the Rocca.

49:25.340 --> 49:27.660
This is better than that
Mom makes you.

49:27.820 --> 49:29.740
You can't believe it ...

49:30.220 --> 49:33.740
This is a cursed place.
We should escape it.

49:33.980 --> 49:36.500
Do you know how many killed here?

49:36.660 --> 49:40.060
This, my guys, is a slaughterhouse.

49:40.620 --> 49:43.660
Whoever arrives in these parts is better
that the sign of the cross is made.

49:43.820 --> 49:47.020
Brigands can go out
at any moment, and there is one ...

49:47.180 --> 49:48.700
Peppe the orbo.

49:48.860 --> 49:52.540
Lame and with one eye that has fun
to get the eyes of the unfortunate

49:52.620 --> 49:54.380
I who happen to subdown.

49:58.700 --> 49:59.980
Laugh, laugh.

50:11.140 --> 50:13.140
- Is this Palermo?
- Yes.

50:14.420 --> 50:16.700
It is the city where I grew up,

50:17.820 --> 50:20.780
where I understood all that
that I know of life.

50:21.860 --> 50:26.140
Here I learned what justice are
and human dignity

50:26.580 --> 50:32.060
and that our efforts towards the truth
They are often ambiguous, dark.

50:35.300 --> 50:37.940
- Are you so long?
- Twelve years.

50:38.940 --> 50:42.140
I started thinking of returning
the next day and instead ...

50:43.180 --> 50:46.460
- Destiny commands us.
- That's not the case.

50:46.660 --> 50:50.100
Destiny has play only when
We move and let him in.

50:53.340 --> 50:54.700
- Yes?
- Yes.

50:56.380 --> 50:58.860
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

51:02.140 --> 51:03.140
Colonel ...

51:05.340 --> 51:08.700
You have had luck
to go away soon from here.

51:11.660 --> 51:14.540
It's the first time
I go away from home...

51:15.980 --> 51:18.020
and I must say that I don't mind.

51:21.900 --> 51:24.660
But ... Excuse me, Colonel.

51:26.220 --> 51:31.500
You know how to explain me
Why are the Sicilians so slandered?

51:31.900 --> 51:35.980
Since we arrived here,
I see nothing but sympathy,

51:36.580 --> 51:39.580
...welcome, kindness.

51:41.660 --> 51:43.580
Why do they all
talk about it badly?

51:44.620 --> 51:46.540
Especially in my part.

51:47.860 --> 51:49.540
You see, Lieutenant ...

51:50.940 --> 51:54.940
The Sicilians have lost all hope
to change the course of history,

51:55.180 --> 51:56.860
they no longer believe in anything

51:58.940 --> 52:01.300
...not even in illusions
who move the world.

52:04.460 --> 52:08.540
This is because when they tried
to improve their condition,

52:09.740 --> 52:12.580
...their attempts have been
suffocated in the blood.

52:13.260 --> 52:15.140
- by whom?
- from those who dominate them,

52:15.740 --> 52:18.940
the most corrupt and ignorant
aristocracy of Europe.

52:23.260 --> 52:27.260
You are young and you have
chosen to fight for freedom.

52:27.980 --> 52:29.780
Consider yourself lucky.

52:30.700 --> 52:35.260
Keep this hope tight
to be able to change the world.

52:38.260 --> 52:39.820
I wish me, Colonel.

52:45.580 --> 52:47.700
It won't be a quiet night.

52:48.940 --> 52:52.460
It doesn't matter,
we are now used to now.

52:52.700 --> 52:54.340
Let me saddle a horse.

53:20.900 --> 53:24.220
Maddalena woman,
there is a visit for you.

53:26.020 --> 53:28.020
Who is it?

53:33.780 --> 53:35.820
Who are you?

53:36.660 --> 53:38.940
Why don't you talk?

53:44.860 --> 53:47.860
- Vincenzo ...
- Yes, it's me.

53:52.260 --> 53:55.500
- Are you with them?
- Don't worry, mom.

53:55.940 --> 53:58.500
I came here only to hug you.

54:08.380 --> 54:12.260
Why ... have you betrayed our king?

54:13.220 --> 54:15.260
Vincenzo Mio ...

54:16.660 --> 54:20.540
Your father and I educated you
To love the things that ...

54:21.340 --> 54:24.740
that we have loved, but you ...

54:25.900 --> 54:29.860
you insist on ... to flee them.

He arrived in Sicily. Do you know anything about it?

55:23.580 --> 55:25.700
And why do you ask us?

55:26.460 --> 55:28.300
We don't even know
Who is this Garibaldi.

55:28.420 --> 55:31.220
But how is it? One who came
with a thousand other men...

55:31.340 --> 55:34.740
to free Sicily from misery and
from slavery, like Jesus Christ.

55:35.060 --> 55:38.180

These nonsense? They are cracks.

55:39.380 --> 55:41.900

Sicily this is and this remains.

They are just like my friend says.

The continental promises,
But then in that place he puts it to you.

55:49.820 --> 55:53.140
We want to fight with Garibaldi
at the cost of dying.

55:54.260 --> 55:57.900

And go and earn the bread.

56:33.180 --> 56:34.260
Do you have any water?

56:34.420 --> 56:35.420
It's here.

56:36.660 --> 56:38.940
It's fresh, we have it
Taken a little while ago to the river.

56:52.140 --> 56:53.580
The Lord pays it to you.

56:54.820 --> 56:57.740
- Let's go. We say goodbye.
- let's say goodbye.

56:58.980 --> 57:01.180
In your opinion,
how old is that boy?

57:01.460 --> 57:03.140
Will it be fifteen years old?

57:48.500 --> 57:51.060

on the windows. See it?

57:52.900 --> 57:55.420
So what wait, go.

57:56.460 --> 57:57.740
Wait.

57:58.020 --> 57:59.460
Let it enjoy it from afar.

58:00.580 --> 58:02.420
As I am excited.

Stop it.

Saveria, my blood.

58:14.340 --> 58:15.740
As he changed.

58:15.820 --> 58:17.060
First how was it?

58:17.260 --> 58:20.580
He was younger,
but always beautiful.

58:21.260 --> 58:23.100
Now he has become more woman.

58:23.940 --> 58:26.820
But of course,
it's ten years old that you left.

58:27.380 --> 58:30.260
Look ...
It spreads the clothes of the children.

58:30.340 --> 58:31.620
Who knows who I am?

58:32.260 --> 58:35.740
It has always been like this,
A big heart helps everyone.

58:37.260 --> 58:40.220
The one with red hair
He is the same as my brother Antonino.

58:40.300 --> 58:42.260
My smaller brother,
I told you about it.

58:42.700 --> 58:44.420
Then they will be the
children of your brother.

58:44.500 --> 58:47.940
Safe. After all these years
He will have married him too.

58:48.260 --> 58:51.620
In fact, see him..there is mine there
brother Antonino. See that he is going down.

58:51.700 --> 58:54.420
The one with red hair.
And the boy is the same as him.

58:54.620 --> 58:57.380
Sure they are all his children,
The boy and the girl.

58:57.500 --> 58:58.980
I'm happy for him.

58:59.260 --> 59:00.740
Two has had it.

59:03.100 --> 59:04.580
And where is your brother's wife?

59:05.220 --> 59:06.620
And who knows?

59:07.620 --> 59:10.100
maybe
He also remained a widower.

59:18.940 --> 59:20.820
Ten years are many ...

59:21.580 --> 59:25.780
For a woman to be all alone
This time is a big sacrifice.

59:27.380 --> 59:29.740
That's why he didn't answer
to your letters.

The Bourbons.

01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:32.100
They killed all the men
of the country,

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:33.980
my children too.

01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:37.700
Everyone shot,
even the parish priest.

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:39.140
I am sorry.

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:41.980
Come here.

01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.980
These were my children,

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:01.580
They are no longer needed.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:14.260
Tie '.

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.420
It's better that way.

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:31.380
- What?
- Nothing, Saveria.

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.260
What did you think?

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:38.220
Who made one like me,

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:41.180
Without money,
without art or part.

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.540
It's better that way.

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:51.780
Wakes up!

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:54.900
- Wake up, we have to go away from here.
- Wake up!

01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:56.340
Force! Hurry up!

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.500
Let's go, Picciotti.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:09.420
- Let's go, Picciotti!
- Garibaldi!

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.980
Let's go!

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.660
Run, run!

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:19.940
Come on, let's go.
Bastards are about to arrive.

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.780
Below!

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.220
ssh ... shut up!

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:24.580
We resort to you,
exile children of Eva.

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:28.380
To you we sigh, gements and crying
in this valley of tears.

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:31.580
ORSU therefore, our lawyer,
contact us ...

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:34.900
shut up!
You are worse than a priest.

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.540
Bepin!

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.860
Bepin!

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.140
Bepin!

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:04.700
Bepin!

01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:57.860
The general asks for you.

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:03.060
Five days
of preparations and negotiations,

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:06.820
...Palermo ready to receive us,
the barricades prepared.

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:09.900
Everything ...
calculated, meditated...

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:13.700
...and now we are here to do
An inlookers back.

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:16.380
How much can we get back?
How much?

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.140
We have a crevasse behind us,
We cannot do the front.

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:23.660
This is my most important mission.
What do we do?

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:26.780
They rejected us, but that's not enough.
They want to humiliate us,

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:31.820
Put the Desfected Medal for us
forcing us to a shameful escape.

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:36.420
Well, do they want this?
We will make sure that they believe it.

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:41.060
We will give him the illusion
that we are withdrawing inland.

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:44.740
Are you thinking of
a diversionary maneuver?

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:49.700
How many men do you need?

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:56.260
Few, in the column that will pretend to escape.
The most will come with me in Palermo.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:01.180
I can know who you have foreseen
in command of these few unhappy?

01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:04.340
You.

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:15.380
I know your commitment

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:19.900
And I know you know like no other
The pitfalls of the Sicilian territory.

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:22.060
You are the most suitable,
Colonel.

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:26.180
The only one who can lead to
a successful end this difficult mission.

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:31.660
You will have to make Von Mechel believe
That Garibaldi is with you and is fleeing.

01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:44.220
General,

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:49.100
You know well that the company
that you have just described

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:51.980
It will hardly go well.

01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:58.780
Also, you know my great desire
to enter Palermo by your side.

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.820
I know well that I ask
you for a great sacrifice.

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:06.620
To the Palermo military I remove
pleasure to conquer their hometown

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:07.980
And I put ...

01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:10.980
man in great danger.

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:15.220
Believe, the choice
is suffered and meditated.

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:17.980
Unfortunately,
there are no alternatives.

01:08:29.579 --> 01:08:30.659
When so ...

01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:34.220
There is nothing more to add.

01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.820
He stood out at your orders.

01:08:44.699 --> 01:08:46.100
Orsini ...

01:08:47.699 --> 01:08:49.060
You have a free hand.

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:52.820
I know you will be able to evaluate the dangers
of the mission that I entrust to you.

01:08:53.739 --> 01:08:55.140
Don't scruple.

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:58.820
Act in the way
that it seems more convenient to you.

01:09:02.579 --> 01:09:04.619
Are there any news, Colonel?

01:09:07.699 --> 01:09:09.940
Ragusìn, do you have a girlfriend?

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:13.100
Yes, in Vicenza.

01:09:13.659 --> 01:09:15.140
When I come back, we get married.

01:09:15.739 --> 01:09:17.380
Have you already consumed?

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.460
Here you are…

01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:22.820
Women I had, huh?
But you know ...

01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:26.180
I am ... romantic,

01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:29.140
- An honest man.
- Lieutenant ...

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:33.619
of life must be sucking
All the taste.

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:36.460
Excess of honesty
It can become a defect.

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:39.980
Write to your girlfriend
to pray for you.

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:44.860
Tomorrow we leave for a mission
for which ... I don't guarantee return.

01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:54.980
And I recommend,

01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:58.380
silence with the company.

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:02.980
I'm hungry too,
but what can I tell you?

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:06.100
Now we find a place, we fall asleep,
So we don't think about it anymore.

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:09.340
But that changes. I even sleep,
I dream things to eat

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.860
And when you wake up
I'm more hungry than before.

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:14.780
Instead if I sleep,
I feel thoughts of women.

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:16.220
- Of women?
- Of women!

01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:18.140
I dreamed of the abbess tonight

01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:20.940
who with the rolling pin kneaded
fresh pasta on its thighs.

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.060
The abbess.

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:25.700
Only that at some point he changed face
and became that of Assuntina.

01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:28.540
How are you going to think
to the old one of the abbess.

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:30.100
The brain.

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:32.980
But at least the pasta
Fresh you ate it or not?

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:36.340
- And of course.
- Altoolà! Stop or shot.

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:07.100
In the end, you too came
With Garibaldi.

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:08.380
You did well.

01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:11.740
Hey, what do you do?

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:13.780
These are our friends.

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:18.820
This…

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:20.540
Now there are two.

01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:25.220
Eh, the war, what do you want?
"It is a fetusa", as you say.

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:30.660
But in Calatafimi
We sang it to the Regi.

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:37.540
And where are you cheering from?
I believed you dead.

01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:41.060
But what a dead!
They are deserters.

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.380
Look whoever meets.

01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:55.420
Come on.

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:06.420
Colonel ...

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:08.860
It was all so confused.

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:14.220
In Marsala, do you remember it?
Cannonate, the barrels ...

01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:16.700
And we lost ourselves.

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:21.820
But I swear, we fought
with blood in the eyes.

01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:25.860
Then what happened after
I don't know how to say.

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:48.220
It is useless to waste bullets
with these two.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.260
For me you are already dead.

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:58.220
- What do we do?
- We keep them.

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:00.820
With what awaits us,

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:04.660
Two cowards can also serve.

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:30.020
Good luck, Orsini.

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:36.140
- See you in Palermo.
- Good luck to you too, general.

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.460
We will see each other in Palermo.

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:04.620
Company, forward.

01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:32.260
Sorry, lieutenant.

01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:34.940
Why are we leaving our companions?

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:38.700
Are we not going to Palermo to fight?
Where do we go?

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:43.220
Hey…what is it,
the game of questions?

01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:45.300
They told you that do you ask
the questions about the donkeys?

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:47.340
Let's go, up, force.

01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:52.940
♪ You wake up with the Sol d'Api ♪ ♪

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:57.620
♪ and you showed that
you are not cowardly ♪

01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:03.260
♪ For this reason you
are more dear to me ... ♪

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:06.700
It was lucky not to go to Palermo.

01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:09.460
But because it was not nice if
we entered in Palermo by victoriosi?

01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:12.620
But which victorious,
That will be a carnage.

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.620
We had a ass to finish
in the column of Orsini.

01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:18.900
I don't believe in the ass,
Only the cards count.

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:36.060
Good morning, Colonel. I am
the above of the Baron of Santa Eufemia

01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:39.100
and I honor myself to be a friend
of your illustrious family.

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:43.420
I come to offer you my respects
And to offer you my help.

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:47.780
Thanks, but I don't need
of anyone's help.

01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:52.420
Excellence, you are Sicilian
And you know better than me

01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:54.860
than in these country roads...

01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:59.300
...a protection that does not
stand out it can help.

01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:03.660
It may be, but the protection of
which you deal with you don't care.

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:08.180
Your way of speaking surprises me,
Excellence.

01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:11.380
But save the excellence.

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:17.500
Colonel ...

01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:26.820
Before leaving you, I have to let
you know that my presence here...

01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:29.860
is due to an agreement entered
into with your superiors.

01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:32.540
- Which superior?
- Don't you guess it?

01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:37.460
High officers who enjoy trust
of your general.

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:39.660
Here I command.

01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:43.580
They are not superior to us,
is it clear? Command me.

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:45.220
If so…

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:49.500
Good luck, Colonel.

01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:56.060
Let's go, Picciotti.

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:06.220
- Colonel, what did that man want?
- Didn't you understand it?

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.980
Dear Ragusìn ...

01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:13.340
Now the barons and the mafia
They started playing the revolution.

01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:17.620
After the Bourbons we will have
to hunt also this gentaglia,

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.260
...if those who govern
us have the courage.

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:23.660
But ...
it seemed to me very respectful.

01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:27.900
Lieutenant, you are a good official,
but you didn't understand anything about Sicily.

01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:56.980
the bird
He entered the cage.

01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:12.820
Are you afraid of water?

01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:15.540
I come from the countryside.

01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:17.460
Don't you wash in the countryside?

01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:19.740
But how much is you?

01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:22.580
These are for you.

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:26.540
Thank you.

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:30.100
- Don't let me make a bad impression.
- Listen!

01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:34.220
What we hoped is happening.
The enemy is behind us.

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:38.020
We are called to face
This great disparity of forces.

01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:40.740
As? With intelligence,

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:44.020
The only resource we have.

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:47.460
We will not give the enemy
the time to reflect.

01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:51.140
Even if we are few,
We have to seem many.

01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:52.820
This is the deception.

01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:57.620
We have an advantage in our favor,
Corleone.

01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:00.540
From up there we can keep the enemy
under shooting

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:02.540
and commit it as long as possible.

01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:07.260
A day lost next to us
It is one day earned for Garibaldi,

01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:09.380
For Sicily, for Italy.

01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:19.060
Saveria ...

01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:21.100
Saveria ...

01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:24.180
Saveria, my life,

01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:26.580
But do you like it again?

01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:29.220
Or did you change your mind?

01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:32.380
Now with money ...

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.260
First the house ...

01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:37.980
And then we get married, my life.

01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:43.060
First the house...
and then we get married.

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:46.020
Eh?

01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:08.260
- Ragusìn.
- commands.

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:11.980
Get occupy with Colubrina
that fortress.

01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:14.020
Yes, Lord.

01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:39.700
Colonel Orsini, that God bless her.

01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:44.060
Me and my fellow villagers
We are at your disposal.

01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:47.380
- Viva Garibaldi!
- Viva Garibaldi!

01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:55.620
This, you must bring it up there.

01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:57.900
It is an order of the colonel.

01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:03.580
Let's go, guys.

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:06.140
Keep hard.

01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:21.140
There is no one.

01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:23.820
We leave the cannon
here and run away.

01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.420
But where you run away, walk.

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.020
Behind we have the Bourbons,

01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:31.460
in front of Orsini and this time
If they take us, they shot us safe.

01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:33.940
- Walk.
- As you say.

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:35.460
- Oh ...
- Eh?

01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:37.980
If anything,
I heard from a picciotto...

01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:41.260
that if we remain alive
they give us the allowance.

01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:46.260
And do you believe it?
You are truly stupid, spitale.

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:52.180
If this was able to Garibaldi,
It would be too beautiful.

01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:54.380
You imagine if Palermo make capital.

01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:56.020
Palermo cannot do it.

01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:58.340
Too dirty.

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:02.660
- If anything Naples.
- Why, is Naples clean?

01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:04.260
So I heard.

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:09.900
The only fear is if they change their mind
And they make capital Milan, these cuckolds.

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:12.380
They can't do it Milan, it is above ...

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:14.380
And who arrives more?

01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:17.540
Precisely for this.
It is there above that they have the money.

01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:11.580
Fold!

01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:15.500
You can't pass here!
We have to get around them, go up the fortress.

01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:19.420
Come here!

01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:35.740
Guys, look down,
The cuckolds are going up.

01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:37.780
I go to tell the Colonel.

01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:40.420
- What do we do?
- You have to stop them.

01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:41.780
And how do we stop them?

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:43.980
With this.

01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:50.260
First the other, struggled.

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:52.460
Mind, three times I explained to him.
Give me here!

01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:54.300
The piston.

01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:56.100
Come on, fast!

01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:58.140
Come on, strength.

01:24:58.220 --> 01:24:59.900
Hid, hid.

01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:01.220
Removed, removed.

01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:06.060
Go, make your job.

01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:13.940
What happened?

01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:15.500
It happened that it didn't work.

01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:18.780
- You said you know how to burst.
- Of course I can do it!

01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:35.660
You see that it worked,
They are running away. Cuckold!

01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:37.620
Let's do another
that we make them dance.

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:39.340
Go, go!

01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:47.900
they discovered
our maneuver.

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:50.260
They are more than they seem.

01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:53.260
The fortress is also protected.

01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:57.020
Then we will wait.

01:25:57.260 --> 01:25:59.100
They cannot resist for a long time.

01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:02.940
Let the camp set up.

01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:16.940
Mammuzza ...

01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:20.620
Mammuzza ... Mammuzza ...

01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:22.180
Oh, Nico '.

01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:23.660
Nico '...

01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:25.580
What happened?

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:28.660
They fuck me, I'm dying.

01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:32.180
But what are you dying? Look at me.

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.860
But that you are dying, this
It is a crack. What are you doing, jokes?

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:38.420
Don't worry, we take you
to the camp and we are sewing.

01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:40.620
Oh! Look at me.

01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:42.940
We have to enter Palermo, right?
How did you say?

01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:44.580
We have to go to free Sicily.

01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:47.420
- Look at me though, eyes open.
- In Palermo?

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:48.500
Palermo.

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:50.180
You told us to come here

01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:52.500
To come and free
Palermo, do you remember?

01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:54.980
Do you remember? Look at me, Nico '.

01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:58.820
You made a head like that! Tell you.
Sicily ... look at me though.

01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:00.900
- Picciotti ...
- Eh?

01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:04.340
But where is Palermo, on the continent?

01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:12.260
Little boy, look at me!

01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:13.820
Don't go!

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:16.540
- Nico '!
- Dome '... Dome'!

01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:52.420
♪ Goodbye, my beautiful, goodbye ♪

01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:58.780
♪ The army goes away ♪

01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:04.460
♪ And if I did not leave too ♪

01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:07.900
♪ It would be a cowardice ♪

01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:12.060
Colonel,
The artillerymen turned on the fires.

01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:14.860
They wait for your orders.

01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:20.660
Well, Ragusìn.

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.980
Now we can leave the country too.

01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:43.700
the time has come,
Woods.

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:48.620
I want to surprise them
Before you do the day.

01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:48.220
Give me a torch.

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:55.700
This gentaglia who helped them
must be punished!

01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:57.340
Give the country on fire!

01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:59.540
Force the doors!

01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:01.780
Enter the houses!

01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:04.060
The doors down!

01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:07.620
Force the doors!

01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:11.140
The doors!

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:33.580
- They don't let us enter the country.
- why?

01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:37.820
Colonel,
Your presence here is not welcome.

01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:41.460
In these floats there are injured
who have been traveling with me for many days.

01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:45.460
- They need food, rest.
- I understand it and I dolial.

01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:49.220
But you will have to look for refuge
In neighboring countries, not here.

01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:53.020
These men have left
House and affections

01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:54.940
To come to the rescue of Sicily.

01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:59.780
- Where is your gratitude?
- Vossignoria asks too much.

01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:03.500
I had offered you
My help and you refused it.

01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:07.500
The people of Giuliana still have
the sense of honor and respect.

01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:09.500
Honor and respect!

01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:13.780
You use these words
mortifying its meaning

01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:17.540
and my contempt
For people like you are enormous.

01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:22.580
Yes? And what about them?
Also this poor people despised?

01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:25.700
Feel you, to whoever you want
to take the ass, piece of stupid!

01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:29.620
Leave this poor people alone.
Do you know how we treat the bastards like you?

01:31:29.740 --> 01:31:32.220
No, no, no. Ragusìn, not so.

01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:36.420
I would like to solve the question too
like you,

01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:38.260
But it would be a mistake.

01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:40.780
Gazzette from all over the world

01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:43.060
would write
that the liberators of Sicily

01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:46.100
they occupied a country
with violence and blood

01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:49.900
And this must not happen,

01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:51.660
never.

01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:56.220
Gentlemen ...

01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:03.580
I leave you to your quiet.

01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:07.060
You are now only shadows,

01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:10.180
...agonizing ghosts,

01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:13.780
...larvae of a world
that will disappear.

01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:18.580
...in Italy for which
we are fighting

01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:22.740
there will be no more
place for those like you.

01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:26.260
Viva Garibaldi!
Long live freedom!

01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:29.180
Viva Garibaldi!
Long live freedom!

01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:32.020
Viva Garibaldi!
Long live freedom!

01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:34.740
Viva Garibaldi!
Long live freedom!

01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:37.820
Viva Garibaldi!
Long live freedom!

01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:40.420
Viva Garibaldi!
Long live freedom!

01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:43.100
Viva Garibaldi!
Long live freedom!

01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:45.580
Viva Garibaldi!
Long live freedom!

01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:28.020
- Colonel, welcome to Sambuca.
- My respects, Mr. Mayor.

01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:31.860
We will do everything possible
To give asylum to the injured,

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:34.820
But if the Bourbons follow you here,

01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:37.940
We risk
to be the first to be shot.

01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:42.260
Our friends from Corleone have seen
The sacrifices of a lifetime go in smoke

01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:45.260
- and become ash.
- Did they put Corleone on fire?

01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:47.540
- Yes.
- Our homes too

01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:51.700
they will be on fire without
even making sure to rummage.

01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:56.180
We think it's safer host the wounded
in the homes of the popular.

01:33:56.820 --> 01:34:01.620
Humble, poor houses,
but inhabited by people of heart.

01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:05.940
Before saying a word,
they would get killed.

01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:10.380
Then I do you the bang,
but you do not scare yourself.

01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:12.260
I did this.

01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:15.340
Here it is.

01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:16.500
Feel.

01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:18.660
Bomb!

01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:21.260
Do we make another one?

01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:24.820
Attention, all here.

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:28.460
Here it is, you hear!

01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:31.100
Bomb!

01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:12.780
This is the most beautiful of all.
Now it arrives. Hear it!

01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:16.460
But do not scare yourself.
Hearing it, hearing it.

01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:25.220
Rose'…

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:27.420
But where's going?

01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:05.180
Assuntina!
Why do you hide?

01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:08.900
- You are wrong, it's not me.
- I understand that it is you.

01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:12.420
Your nun's guise,
What happened to it?

01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:21.060
True, it's me.
After you leave,

01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:24.020
The abbess hoped to me from the convent
because I said it was a thief

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:26.380
And I stripped me of God's dress.

01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:28.020
Oh!

01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:31.660
But are you here?
It is half an hour looking for you.

01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:35.500
What are you doing in the cemetery?

01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:44.620
This girl
It is the same as Assuntina.

01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:45.980
It's her.

01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:49.980
Is it she?

01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:59.380
Colonel Orsini,
I have a message for you.

01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:07.820
General Garibaldi
entered Palermo.

01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:11.540
I can't believe it, Colonel.

01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:14.500
Yes, but now we have
to save this country.

01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:18.060
Call me the mayor and the priest.

01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:34.020
Enjoy your meal.

01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:37.180
- Mmm ...
- Mmm ...

01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:38.900
- Good has come.
- Yes.

01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:50.820
- I don't deserve your smiles.
- Why, do you assume?

01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:53.260
It's so nice to see you again.

01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:55.980
I will tell you something.

01:37:56.540 --> 01:37:58.580
- Talk, we hear you.
- We hear you.

01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:02.500
- It's a bad thing.
- Ugly?

01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:05.380
But that it can be there
badly in a house like that...

01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:07.620
...and with a plate
of pasta like this.

01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:12.380
I stole your money.

01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:17.820
Calm down!
Place it.

01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:20.620
I didn't have a dowry,
For this I made myself a nun.

01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:24.540
But when you arrived at the convent
I wanted to marry me.

01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:27.300
And the idea came to me
to steal Domenico's money.

01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:30.980
But the other night I dreamed of
an angel who had Garibaldi's face.

01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:35.140
He told me to return them
And I promised him to obey.

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:49.580
There are only a few ears missing.

01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:52.180
I ask you for forgiveness,
Domenico.

01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:19.420
The pasta was cold.

01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:23.020
Oh ... the pasta cools!

01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:45.220
Feel, feel, feel!

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:49.340
By order of
the mayor of Sambuca,

01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:52.220
...to all citizens,

01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:56.780
...go home and
put the butter to the door.

01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:59.500
The enemy who with
cowardice and scarring...

01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:01.540
...he set fire to Corleone

01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:04.180
...he is coming to Sambuca!

01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:07.020
Be careful.

01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:15.740
Let's go! Let's go!

01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:19.460
The guards are coming, run!

01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:51.180
Ave, Maria, full of grace,
The Lord is with you.

01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:53.340
You are blessed among women...

01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:55.540
and blessed is the fruit
of your breast, Jesus.

01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:59.140
Santa Maria, Mother of God ...

01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:23.660
See it like this.

01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:28.580
This population of Sambuca
He moved me.

01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:33.180
In these living conditions,

01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:36.140
not different from those
of the donkey or goat,

01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:40.260
...these people keep
Human feelings intact and tall.

01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:45.460
Sweetness, pity, courage.

01:41:48.540 --> 01:41:50.260
I wonder if we have the right,

01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:52.700
...as happened in Corleone,
to bring them ...

01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:55.700
New suffering.

01:41:57.380 --> 01:41:59.140
The violence of the war,

01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:03.780
The risk of looting
and devastation.

01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:07.980
In the name of what, then?

01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:11.540
In the name of freedom.

01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:15.260
Freedom in the future to be able
to elect representatives,

01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:19.100
maybe to publish newspapers
And even of writing books.

01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:23.380
But the freedom of not hungry now,

01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:26.220
to dress dignity now,

01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:28.700
...to live in more
human places now!

01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:32.220
But Colonel, we have
A mission to carry on.

01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:33.620
If we fail the goal,

01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:36.660
Things, for this poor people,
they will never change.

01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:41.340
Who tells you that they will change with us?
- Everyone thinks in Europe.

01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:44.500
- Didn't he read what Dumas writes?
- Dear lieutenant,

01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:49.420
Dumas is an ingenuity writer
who uses fantasy to make propaganda.

01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:52.420
He is a clothes.

01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:58.540
We are meeting an era in which
The abbers will be made.

- Isn't there anyone here?
- How not? There are many Christians.

01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:57.980
But at this time
Nobody has been seen yet.

01:45:58.220 --> 01:45:59.460
They sleep,

01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:00.660
they work,

01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:02.260
cheat.

01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:04.260
Who knows?

01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:27.140
Parish priest,
where are you going?

01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:30.380
You forgot what you
The Colonel told you last night.

01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:34.180
You have to go to the Bourbons and
to say that Garibaldi entered Palermo.

01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:38.540
The Lord must forgive me,

01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:40.980
...but I am a poor man.

01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:42.940
I can't do it.

01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:45.100
Believe me, my legs tremble.

01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:46.900
Please ...

01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:48.420
Let me go.

01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:51.340
But also to you,
who makes you do it?

01:46:52.300 --> 01:46:53.740
Escape with me.

01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:55.860
These kill us all.

01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:20.780
Commander! That God bless you,
You finally arrived.

01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:25.260
though,
Unfortunately, you arrived late.

01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:26.940
Everyone has disappeared.

01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:28.740
It remained

01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:31.340
Just a few children,
some patients,

01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:32.620
some...

01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:34.860
...a few dying, me.

01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:36.460
Few people.

01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:40.060
- Sa, rumors turn.
- What rumors?

01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:41.220
By Garibaldi.

01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:45.180
Of Garibaldi said he was close here
with his troop and who are brigands.

01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:46.500
They behave badly!

01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:50.180
Enter the churches,
Seviziano Sisters and novices.

01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:53.220
Fortunately, you arrived.
I play the bells for celebration ...

01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:57.100
- No, you won't play anything.
- Oh well, as you want.

01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:59.540
I ... I said to celebrate it.

01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:03.940
Where is the mayor?
Why don't you get to greet me?

01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:05.980
The mayor?

01:48:06.460 --> 01:48:09.940
- Well…
- that I can do for you ...

01:48:10.180 --> 01:48:14.940
Very illustrious excellence?
What a surprise, what a joy!

01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:18.420
Who have those two in their heads?
Do they want to make us kill?

01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:23.020
Excellence,
Having here is a party for us.

01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:28.620
Of course, as you see,
people are afraid.

01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:32.660
The danger of falling
in hostage of that bandit of Garibaldi

01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:34.700
He kept us in terror,

01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:36.860
But your presence, excellence ...

01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:39.620
Your presence comforts us.

01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:42.580
Eh ...

01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:45.020
Comforts us.

01:48:49.740 --> 01:48:53.620
- Where did you hide them?
Who are you talking about, excellence?

01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:56.620
Nobody was seen here,
Only the flies.

01:48:56.740 --> 01:49:00.460
- You know who I am talking about,
Garibaldi... Garibaldi?

01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:03.340
- Mhm.
- Why, excellence, don't you know?

01:49:04.060 --> 01:49:07.580
Garibaldi, unfortunately,
Tonight he entered Palermo.

01:49:08.660 --> 01:49:11.020
Garibaldi in Palermo?

01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:15.500
It is the truth.

01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:20.580
Between midnight eleven and
He entered Palermo, unfortunately.

01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:28.700
Word of priest, Word of God.

01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:34.940
- Lieutenant, take the weapons.
- Upon orders.

01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:38.900
Liars!
You are two damn liars!

01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:43.140
Garibaldi is hidden here!
Open this door!

01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:44.660
Let me enter!

01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:49.180
I swear to you, it's the truth.
Garibaldi entered Palermo tonight.

01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:57.660
Colonel, this is a quiet country
who is not looking for trouble

01:49:57.780 --> 01:50:00.180
And it doesn't
deserve your suspicion.

01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:09.380
The army will arrive in a second...

01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:13.900
...and he will sift the whole country,
House for home, hole hole.

01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:27.780
Colonel, are we kidding?

01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:31.780
An deployment of forces like this
For a country of poor people?

01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:34.620
You are aiming for a cannon
against an ant.

01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:37.780
While Garibaldi if they are fun in Palermo,
Do you take it with us?

01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:42.820
Then if you don't believe it, take us
As hostages and bring us to Palermo.

01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:48.260
There you will understand, when we arrive,
if we have said a lie or if it is the truth.

01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:52.180
Right, Colonel. What does the country
have to do with it? We are there.

01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:55.260
In case you will shoot us.

01:50:56.780 --> 01:51:01.460
As it is right that it happens to two cowards
who dare to lie to a royal officer,

01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:06.780
But if it's true ...
Let us go, right?

01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:10.580
Eh.

01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:15.780
Look at them well,
Your mayor and your priest

01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:20.060
because if they lied,
You will not see them anymore!

01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:46.380
These are no longer needed to me,

01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:51.340
but remember, there are games
that can be done with one hand...

01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:55.700
...and games that are made
with two hands.

01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:00.860
Thank you.

01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:27.180
"I haven't seen them anymore
and I haven't had them anymore...

01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:32.260
yet I have been looking for them for years,
Domenico Tricò and Rosario Spitale.

01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:36.260
wherever it came to me
A report, I ran to see.

01:53:36.460 --> 01:53:38.460
I went today
At the asylum of Palermo

01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:42.500
To check a track provided to me
from the prefecture. "

01:54:27.540 --> 01:54:29.100
It's him.

01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:43.820
Tricò ...

01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:51.460
They look like mice,
but they are birds...

01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:53.820
...and they also fly at night.

01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:06.020
Unfortunately
this also like the others

01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:08.580
It turned out to be a false track.

01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:12.820
As long as it is,
I won't stop looking for them.

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:17.300
I feel the duty to honor
To the two valiant picciotti,

01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:19.820
that omisi from the relationship
that I stiff for Garibaldi

01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:23.420
In the aftermath of the victorious
Shipping of the thousand.

01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:27.020
Omission that
I have never forgiven me.

01:55:28.180 --> 01:55:32.580
Today after the many
compromises that occurred

01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:35.660
and the many instances betrayed,

01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:39.060
I feel a certain bitterness
for the political outcome

01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:41.860
which followed our expedition.

01:55:42.260 --> 01:55:44.260
The image of those two poor Christs

01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:49.260
than with impotence
I saw moving away from the square

01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:53.060
It is the only consolation
to my disappointment.

01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:57.580
Hence my will
to redeem their sacrifice...

01:55:57.740 --> 01:56:00.500
...and not to let him
fall into oblivion.

01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:14.620
Bear, please approach.

01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:03.780
Goes thought.

01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:27.340
Goes thought.

01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:32.740
Please.

01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:54.660
Follow me.

01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:10.260
The tables are all busy.
You have to be patient here.

01:58:10.780 --> 01:58:13.380
If you sit down,
I bring you something to drink.

01:58:13.540 --> 01:58:15.820
Water and anise, thanks.

01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:42.460
gentlemen, turned.
For the counter it is Regina.

01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:03.580
For the counter
it is infantrymen.

01:59:38.940 --> 01:59:41.180
- Please.
- Thank you.

01:59:59.180 --> 02:00:01.700
- Please, Lord.
- Thank you.

02:00:03.580 --> 02:00:05.540
Those two are already seated.

02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:23.340
Good evening.
Is it free? I can?

02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:32.420
is a pleasure
make your knowledge.

02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:34.020
- Our pleasure.
- can I?

02:00:34.100 --> 02:00:35.860
Very happy. Please.

02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:50.380
Please.

02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:10.460
Ah ...

02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:49.980
Word.

02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:56.940
Word.

02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:11.380
Everything.

02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:13.700
I see.

02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:16.660
- step.
- Pass.

02:02:23.060 --> 02:02:25.540
Britno of axes.

02:02:34.220 --> 02:02:35.820
It takes luck.

02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:45.580
There is another one.

02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:08.500
Good evening.

02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:28.340
Colonel Orsini.

02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:33.980
What a pleasure to see you again.

02:03:34.580 --> 02:03:37.420
You came
Why do you want to play a game?

02:03:38.100 --> 02:03:39.460
Yes.

02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:44.620
First, though, the young
lady has to leave the salon.

02:03:46.340 --> 02:03:48.900
We play this game in my own way.

02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:26.700
Now you can give the cards.

02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:42.620
Poor Italy,

02:05:44.900 --> 02:05:47.220
What a blunder!

02:06:16.900 --> 02:06:20.180
[sound "goes, thought, on golden in"
from Nabucco, act III of Giuseppe Verdi]
