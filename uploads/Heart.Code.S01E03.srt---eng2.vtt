00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:11.125
Hey.

00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:11.965
Do you know each other?

00:00:12.025 --> 00:00:13.905
She’s the bakery owner you’re so obsessed with.

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:16.305
Instructor, please train my daughter well.

00:00:16.393 --> 00:00:17.185
No favoritism.

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:18.105
No special treatment.

00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:20.465
Wrong is wrong. Fill in whatever she lacks.

00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:22.285
I want my daughter to be a survivor.

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:23.465
And to be able to stand on her own.

00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:25.291
It's only the first day.

00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:27.545
Don't you want to stay and
fight just a little longer?

00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:28.905
Stay and prove.

00:00:28.985 --> 00:00:31.025
Show the people who think you've already given up

00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:33.505
that you aren't as weak as they thought.

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:35.265
Your daughter makes such delicious cakes.

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:37.044
Why did you let her become a police?

00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:19.785
Why...

00:01:21.273 --> 00:01:22.894
Your heart is beating so fast.

00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:31.825
It's okay.

00:04:10.025 --> 00:04:13.105
Without a brooch, just tie
a knot at the corner like this.

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:16.505
Then, tuck in all four corners neatly

00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:18.345
Pull it as tight as possible.

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:20.465
And then, tuck in the edges along the sides.

00:04:21.085 --> 00:04:21.905
Like this.

00:04:24.345 --> 00:04:25.391
And then, take the blanket.

00:04:26.825 --> 00:04:28.863
Then, you double-check everything.

00:04:30.225 --> 00:04:30.985
Done.

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:37.287
Why is this so complicated?

00:04:37.505 --> 00:04:39.145
It's just for a few hours of sleep anyway.

00:04:42.465 --> 00:04:44.091
I'll make the bed for you this time

00:04:45.265 --> 00:04:46.692
Because if I let you do it yourself.

00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:48.585
We definitely won't make it to the assembly on time.

00:04:49.905 --> 00:04:50.331
Oh.

00:04:51.847 --> 00:04:53.265
I thought you were worried about me.

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:54.313
Turns out.

00:04:54.465 --> 00:04:55.985
You’re just afraid of
getting punished because of me.

00:05:07.534 --> 00:05:09.242
Who would ever worry about a naughty kid like you?

00:05:42.585 --> 00:05:43.412
Anyway...

00:05:43.924 --> 00:05:45.019
Let's practice this evening.

00:05:45.665 --> 00:05:46.825
Then tomorrow, you’ll do it on your own.

00:05:57.905 --> 00:05:59.145
Before we begin today's training,

00:06:00.145 --> 00:06:01.345
I have a question to ask.

00:06:03.545 --> 00:06:04.578
Who broke the rules last night?

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:07.802
Sneaking in for a shower

00:06:08.425 --> 00:06:09.732
during unauthorized hours.

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:13.858
Step forward, right now!

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:18.305
Before I have someone check the CCTV footage.

00:06:47.585 --> 00:06:48.385
Who else?

00:06:49.825 --> 00:06:50.625
No one else, sir.

00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:52.225
Just me.

00:06:55.865 --> 00:06:56.665
Are you sure?

00:06:58.065 --> 00:06:58.985
Yes, I'm sure.

00:07:04.865 --> 00:07:06.225
Since you've admitted to it.

00:07:07.905 --> 00:07:08.865
After dinner

00:07:09.585 --> 00:07:10.545
report to me.

00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:12.425
Yes, sir.

00:07:15.305 --> 00:07:16.225
Back to your position.

00:07:38.145 --> 00:07:38.945
Hey.

00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:40.825
Why did you do this?

00:07:40.985 --> 00:07:43.385
I’m not okay with you taking the blame for me.

00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:45.985
If I had stopped you from the beginning,

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:47.545
You wouldn't have taken that shower.

00:07:48.345 --> 00:07:49.665
Supporting someone in doing wrong,

00:07:49.745 --> 00:07:51.345
is a violation too.

00:07:54.825 --> 00:07:55.385
Then...

00:07:55.705 --> 00:07:56.825
After target practice,

00:07:57.265 --> 00:07:58.505
I’m going to see the instructor with you.

00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:02.585
Don't make a big deal out of it.

00:08:03.185 --> 00:08:04.585
I'm stronger than you.

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:06.828
And I'm more used to the system.

00:08:08.505 --> 00:08:09.025
Listen,

00:08:10.105 --> 00:08:11.345
If you feel guilty,

00:08:11.705 --> 00:08:13.265
then just focus on doing a great job.

00:08:14.185 --> 00:08:15.625
Blow that target to pieces.

00:08:20.385 --> 00:08:21.345
This range

00:08:22.385 --> 00:08:24.185
isn't just about hitting the target.

00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:25.665
It’s about focus.

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:27.225
And self-control.

00:08:27.345 --> 00:08:29.105
To become one with your weapon.

00:08:29.572 --> 00:08:30.585
Before pulling the trigger,

00:08:30.785 --> 00:08:31.638
your mind must be still.

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:35.065
Pick your preferred weapon.

00:09:00.651 --> 00:09:01.437
Back straight.

00:09:04.689 --> 00:09:05.948
Arms out.

00:09:08.372 --> 00:09:09.405
Steady your aim.

00:09:15.185 --> 00:09:16.313
Lower your hands a bit.

00:09:34.825 --> 00:09:35.677
That's it.

00:09:45.207 --> 00:09:46.345
Don't forget to rack the slide.

00:09:48.564 --> 00:09:49.336
Like this.

00:09:52.185 --> 00:09:52.745
Umm.

00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:54.957
Keep your arms straight.

00:10:14.258 --> 00:10:15.211
Whoa!

00:10:16.425 --> 00:10:17.979
How are you such a sharpshooter?

00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:19.555
Hey,

00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:21.127
I thought you were James Bond.

00:10:23.444 --> 00:10:24.226
What about yours?

00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:25.051
How did it go?

00:10:25.165 --> 00:10:26.085
Hey you guys.

00:10:26.557 --> 00:10:28.052
Where did all these bullets come from?

00:10:28.505 --> 00:10:29.185
Let me see.

00:10:29.705 --> 00:10:30.870
- Did you actually fire these yourself?
- Oh, wait.

00:10:30.905 --> 00:10:32.085
There were only ten rounds.

00:10:32.225 --> 00:10:33.051
Yeah, you're right.

00:10:33.145 --> 00:10:34.038
Let me take a look.

00:10:36.946 --> 00:10:38.289
I did hit the target.

00:10:45.426 --> 00:10:46.731
just someone else's target.

00:10:49.225 --> 00:10:50.310
You did good.

00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:52.703
You actually hit it three times.

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:55.517
Really?

00:10:58.191 --> 00:10:58.929
You're pretty good.

00:11:07.597 --> 00:11:08.345
Hey.

00:11:10.532 --> 00:11:11.659
keep these to stay awake.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.470
Thanks.

00:11:15.245 --> 00:11:15.739
You

00:11:15.858 --> 00:11:17.545
really remind me of my father.

00:11:18.275 --> 00:11:19.044
How so?

00:11:21.336 --> 00:11:22.018
Well...

00:11:23.124 --> 00:11:24.178
I mean that

00:11:24.498 --> 00:11:25.976
most fathers

00:11:26.164 --> 00:11:27.694
don't like their kids eating sweets, right?

00:11:27.945 --> 00:11:28.831
Because they're worried about cavities

00:11:29.065 --> 00:11:29.465
Hmm.

00:11:29.585 --> 00:11:30.870
But my dad.

00:11:31.105 --> 00:11:32.751
He liked me to carry candy to school.

00:11:33.335 --> 00:11:34.626
He said it was to help me stay awake.

00:11:35.145 --> 00:11:35.805
See?

00:11:35.965 --> 00:11:37.026
You're just like him.

00:11:40.105 --> 00:11:40.967
Hey.

00:11:41.665 --> 00:11:42.943
Little one.

00:11:47.785 --> 00:11:48.546
Hurry up!

00:11:48.705 --> 00:11:49.645
We're going to be late!

00:11:52.065 --> 00:11:54.418
The transit period is the most vulnerable phase.

00:11:55.655 --> 00:11:58.150
Assailants often take
this opportunity to surround,

00:11:58.724 --> 00:11:59.590
ambush,

00:12:00.202 --> 00:12:01.329
or plant explosives.

00:12:01.745 --> 00:12:02.838
In this case,

00:12:03.172 --> 00:12:03.840
the driver

00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:05.677
is positioned in the front right seat.

00:12:06.265 --> 00:12:08.905
The front left seat is for a skilled bodyguard,

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:10.160
responsible for route observation.

00:12:11.572 --> 00:12:13.645
The rear left seat is the primary spot

00:12:13.882 --> 00:12:15.005
reserved for the VIP.

00:12:15.555 --> 00:12:16.821
The rear right seat

00:12:17.245 --> 00:12:18.849
is occupied by another elite bodyguard,

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.804
tasked with flanking the VIP.

00:12:21.117 --> 00:12:23.305
The person closest to the VIP

00:12:24.145 --> 00:12:26.063
is responsible for acting as a human shield.

00:12:27.075 --> 00:12:28.915
This simulation

00:12:28.985 --> 00:12:30.705
involves driving through a high-risk area.

00:12:31.336 --> 00:12:32.205
Ambush in progress.

00:12:32.665 --> 00:12:35.105
00 from 31006, reporting Code 30.

00:12:35.185 --> 00:12:37.430
Convoy under fire during VIP transit.

00:12:47.628 --> 00:12:49.158
Shots fired from the rear.

00:12:49.305 --> 00:12:51.218
Roadblock ahead, path is blocked.

00:12:51.812 --> 00:12:53.475
Unable to proceed. Obstruction ahead.

00:12:58.965 --> 00:13:00.609
- Exit the vehicle.
- Exit the vehicle.

00:13:07.016 --> 00:13:08.390
Evacuate the VIP.

00:13:10.025 --> 00:13:11.527
Use the vehicle as hard cover.

00:13:11.997 --> 00:13:13.200
Wait for reinforcements.

00:13:21.065 --> 00:13:24.305
Reinforcements will pull up to extract

00:13:24.713 --> 00:13:25.906
the VIP immediately.

00:13:26.625 --> 00:13:28.122
- Get in.
- Get in.

00:13:30.171 --> 00:13:31.005
Go.

00:13:41.496 --> 00:13:42.414
Get in.

00:13:44.505 --> 00:13:45.551
Get in.

00:14:42.825 --> 00:14:44.445
Exhausted feels like I just
came back from an actual war zone.

00:14:45.458 --> 00:14:46.769
Will I make it through the afternoon?

00:14:48.981 --> 00:14:50.341
Just have to push through it.

00:14:50.633 --> 00:14:52.018
unless you want to get chewed out.

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:53.750
Chewed out?

00:14:55.113 --> 00:14:56.546
But at this point, I have to give in.

00:14:56.985 --> 00:14:58.682
My neck, back, and shoulders are killing me.

00:15:03.345 --> 00:15:04.703
Come here. I’ll give you a massage.

00:15:09.757 --> 00:15:11.047
Are you sure about this?

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:14.331
Come on.

00:15:15.305 --> 00:15:15.955
Lie down over there.

00:16:23.739 --> 00:16:24.536
You.

00:16:24.795 --> 00:16:26.282
Hey, you're trembling. I can't do this right.

00:16:27.819 --> 00:16:29.245
It's because you're pressing too hard.

00:16:30.625 --> 00:16:31.750
I'm ticklish.

00:16:33.945 --> 00:16:35.315
Fine, I'll go easier then.

00:16:46.915 --> 00:16:48.165
Is this pressure okay?

00:16:58.985 --> 00:16:59.826
Yeah, that's actually pretty good.

00:17:42.065 --> 00:17:43.051
Feeling better?

00:17:44.465 --> 00:17:45.002
Yes.

00:17:50.585 --> 00:17:51.099
Let's go.

00:18:02.035 --> 00:18:02.835
Hello, Ken.

00:18:03.604 --> 00:18:05.305
Hey, did you just wake up?

00:18:05.615 --> 00:18:06.965
Yeah, I was on the night shift.

00:18:08.265 --> 00:18:11.585
Listen, I wanted to tell you that
Deputy Phakphum was in an accident yesterday.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:12.358
What?

00:18:13.945 --> 00:18:15.715
An accident? Where did it happen?

00:18:16.305 --> 00:18:17.840
And is he okay? How bad is it?

00:18:18.665 --> 00:18:19.785
He's in the hospital now.

00:18:21.185 --> 00:18:22.581
He should be fine now.

00:18:24.929 --> 00:18:26.463
I see.

00:18:26.745 --> 00:18:28.265
But based on the witness statements,

00:18:29.983 --> 00:18:31.451
I don't think it was an accident.

00:18:32.385 --> 00:18:33.785
It looked like a deliberate hit.

00:18:34.365 --> 00:18:35.325
Look into it for me.

00:18:35.785 --> 00:18:38.325
Ok. I'll head over and check
with the local precinct right away.

00:18:43.611 --> 00:18:47.638
I really can't tonight.
I have a VIP surgery case early tomorrow morning.

00:18:49.705 --> 00:18:51.409
But we haven't seen each other all week.

00:18:51.785 --> 00:18:52.915
I miss you so much.

00:18:55.329 --> 00:18:56.779
I miss you too.

00:18:57.524 --> 00:18:58.515
I have to go now.

00:18:58.945 --> 00:19:01.085
Okay, honey. Call me when you're done.

00:19:03.985 --> 00:19:05.085
I’m gonna barf.

00:19:06.715 --> 00:19:07.378
Dad.

00:19:08.233 --> 00:19:09.103
Not this again.

00:19:09.527 --> 00:19:11.812
I’m a grown man. Show me some respect.

00:19:12.945 --> 00:19:14.376
If you want my respect,

00:19:15.085 --> 00:19:17.082
then start acting like you deserve it.

00:19:18.063 --> 00:19:19.465
Are you talking to that girl again?

00:19:20.305 --> 00:19:23.558
Meeting’s starting, and
you're still wasting time on a girl.

00:19:24.615 --> 00:19:26.814
Does my talking to Ann benefit you in any way?

00:19:29.138 --> 00:19:29.875
Sir.

00:19:33.913 --> 00:19:34.545
What?

00:19:36.404 --> 00:19:37.868
That Phakphum. He survived.

00:19:42.905 --> 00:19:43.605
Please, come in.

00:19:44.303 --> 00:19:45.197
This way, please.

00:19:47.585 --> 00:19:48.485
Hello, sir.

00:19:49.138 --> 00:19:49.945
Hello, sir.

00:19:52.485 --> 00:19:53.802
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:55.525
Hello.

00:19:57.652 --> 00:19:59.505
Please excuse me for a moment. I'll be right back.

00:20:03.225 --> 00:20:04.484
Here are your documents.

00:20:09.145 --> 00:20:10.052
All done, Sir.

00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:11.225
Sir.

00:20:13.945 --> 00:20:15.252
How is his condition?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.901
Overall, there are no fractures.
Just some muscle bruising and a sprain.

00:20:19.265 --> 00:20:21.075
So, the doctor wants to keep
him overnight for observation.

00:20:22.265 --> 00:20:25.207
In this case, we'll have to
postpone your surgery for now.

00:20:26.146 --> 00:20:26.863
I understand.

00:20:28.265 --> 00:20:31.576
Ever since the Director passed away,
the hospital has been in total chaos.

00:20:32.118 --> 00:20:33.948
But I’ll find the earliest available date for you.

00:20:35.625 --> 00:20:36.085
Yes.

00:20:41.425 --> 00:20:42.713
Could I have a moment, please?

00:20:46.105 --> 00:20:47.065
Then, I'll take my leave now.

00:21:05.113 --> 00:21:07.287
The assailant killed in the
shootout was indeed one of Burin’s men.

00:21:08.385 --> 00:21:09.785
As for the one who escaped in the vehicle.

00:21:10.305 --> 00:21:12.435
I have the team reviewing
the CCTV footage right now.

00:21:14.025 --> 00:21:14.738
Look closely.

00:21:15.207 --> 00:21:16.299
Don't let them cut the evidence.

00:21:17.378 --> 00:21:17.945
Yes, sir.

00:21:19.235 --> 00:21:22.139
It's a good thing Vicky is
in there, otherwise I'd be worried.

00:21:29.353 --> 00:21:31.322
I think tonight.

00:21:32.174 --> 00:21:33.913
007 won't be getting any sleep.

00:21:36.306 --> 00:21:37.371
After dinner.

00:21:38.111 --> 00:21:38.873
Report to me.

00:21:40.094 --> 00:21:40.797
Yes, sir.

00:21:48.745 --> 00:21:49.545
Seriously?

00:21:52.065 --> 00:21:55.437
You really think a perfectionist
like her would break the rules?

00:21:56.905 --> 00:21:58.338
Well, if it wasn't her, then who else could it be?

00:22:02.557 --> 00:22:04.386
Well... last night.

00:22:05.265 --> 00:22:06.505
when I got up for my shift.

00:22:07.433 --> 00:22:08.505
I saw

00:22:25.945 --> 00:22:28.465
I knew it! It must be her.

00:22:28.545 --> 00:22:32.145
Why does this person always have to cause trouble?

00:22:32.225 --> 00:22:34.665
- Right.
- And why did 007 have to take the fall for her?

00:22:35.037 --> 00:22:36.505
Or maybe

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.602
What a waste for 007,

00:22:41.315 --> 00:22:42.818
she’s had a flawless record.

00:22:43.461 --> 00:22:45.755
- Both here and in real life.
- Ugh!

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.776
You actually know 007?

00:22:50.807 --> 00:22:51.765
Uh...

00:22:53.736 --> 00:22:55.525
I think I’d better go to sleep.

00:22:55.625 --> 00:22:57.465
- Oh.
- I don't want to break the rules like she did.

00:22:57.781 --> 00:23:01.105
Hey, wait! Tell me first

00:23:01.402 --> 00:23:02.425
I'm going to bed.

00:23:27.465 --> 00:23:30.738
Are you... being punished with gym cleaning duty?

00:23:39.785 --> 00:23:40.351
Yes.

00:23:46.865 --> 00:23:48.805
Here, let me give you a hand.

00:24:39.705 --> 00:24:40.765
That took forever.

00:24:46.545 --> 00:24:47.245
Let's go.

00:24:50.105 --> 00:24:50.675
Hey.

00:24:56.637 --> 00:24:59.037
Since we're here in the gym alone together.

00:25:00.998 --> 00:25:03.148
Let's make good use of our free time.

00:25:09.416 --> 00:25:11.899
Make good use of our time.

00:25:14.025 --> 00:25:15.047
How?

00:25:24.385 --> 00:25:25.051
Here.

00:26:03.865 --> 00:26:04.585
Hey.

00:26:17.985 --> 00:26:19.465
You should be more careful.

00:26:20.665 --> 00:26:22.438
The attackers could strike at any moment.

00:26:25.225 --> 00:26:26.282
Come on.

00:26:28.532 --> 00:26:29.207
Hurry up.

00:26:36.647 --> 00:26:37.447
Hmm.

00:26:37.788 --> 00:26:40.425
So this is your idea of making good use of your time?

00:26:42.995 --> 00:26:44.738
I'm training you in self- defense.

00:26:45.259 --> 00:26:47.746
If you want to get better, now is the time.

00:26:48.727 --> 00:26:49.388
Come on,

00:26:49.823 --> 00:26:50.665
Let's keep practicing.

00:26:56.518 --> 00:26:58.405
If you encounter someone bigger

00:26:58.918 --> 00:27:00.765
or stronger,

00:27:02.616 --> 00:27:04.536
use close- quarters combat.

00:27:05.371 --> 00:27:08.095
The legs are the base, and they are the weakness.

00:27:10.345 --> 00:27:11.002
Get down.

00:27:14.025 --> 00:27:14.630
Huh?

00:27:15.339 --> 00:27:16.425
Here too?

00:27:17.505 --> 00:27:18.094
Yes.

00:27:18.825 --> 00:27:20.275
Both the gym and the restrooms.

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:21.899
t's a combo set punishment.

00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:28.845
oh my god

00:28:07.899 --> 00:28:08.856
I’m dead.

00:28:09.665 --> 00:28:10.842
Take a break if you're tired.

00:28:14.745 --> 00:28:15.743
Are you worried about me?

00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:29.047
I’m more worried about myself.

00:28:32.459 --> 00:28:34.602
I'm afraid if someone around here faints again.

00:28:36.145 --> 00:28:37.638
I’ll have to drag them to the infirmary.

00:28:47.665 --> 00:28:48.699
I'm sorry

00:28:49.506 --> 00:28:51.301
for causing you so much trouble since day one.

00:28:53.611 --> 00:28:54.565
It’s fine.

00:28:55.695 --> 00:29:00.132
Luckily, I used to lift weights
a lot, so I’m used to heavy lifting.

00:29:01.645 --> 00:29:02.331
Hey!

00:29:02.783 --> 00:29:04.247
Are you calling me fat?

00:29:05.336 --> 00:29:06.491
I’m just teasing.

00:29:07.778 --> 00:29:10.821
You're a baker,
but I wonder if you ever eat your own cakes.

00:29:11.722 --> 00:29:12.511
You're so thin.

00:29:17.736 --> 00:29:18.431
Go.

00:29:19.225 --> 00:29:20.327
Get back to work.

00:29:21.092 --> 00:29:22.212
The sooner you can rest.

00:29:24.821 --> 00:29:25.353
Go.

00:29:26.305 --> 00:29:26.891
Move it.

00:29:29.985 --> 00:29:30.602
Alright.

00:29:49.585 --> 00:29:50.738
Hey, hey!

00:29:51.089 --> 00:29:52.838
That's too much, stop.

00:30:00.105 --> 00:30:01.284
Let's just use two bottles

00:30:01.458 --> 00:30:02.508
so we can get this over with.

00:30:06.505 --> 00:30:07.423
Hey.

00:30:07.625 --> 00:30:08.685
What are you doing?

00:30:14.465 --> 00:30:15.025
Ow!

00:30:59.065 --> 00:31:00.865
Are you okay? Are you okay?

00:31:03.265 --> 00:31:04.188
Hey.

00:31:07.092 --> 00:31:08.511
help.

00:31:35.757 --> 00:31:36.877
I'll be right behind you.

00:31:36.955 --> 00:31:37.858
Please take care of her.

00:31:38.415 --> 00:31:41.325
Doctors, is she going to be okay?

00:31:41.517 --> 00:31:42.491
it's alright.

00:31:43.665 --> 00:31:44.325
Go.

00:31:53.625 --> 00:31:55.148
You should head to the infirmary first.

00:31:56.025 --> 00:31:57.635
Even though you don't seem to be badly affected,

00:31:57.865 --> 00:31:59.346
I'd like to check just to be sure.

00:32:00.815 --> 00:32:02.678
Why is 007 in such a state?

00:32:06.741 --> 00:32:09.367
You mixed bleach containing hypochlorite

00:32:10.049 --> 00:32:12.125
with a regular floor cleaner.

00:32:12.991 --> 00:32:15.614
When these two react together,

00:32:16.153 --> 00:32:18.522
they produce chlorine gas or a toxic gas.

00:32:19.917 --> 00:32:20.939
It's extremely dangerous.

00:32:23.078 --> 00:32:25.110
007 likely inhaled a lot of it.

00:32:25.785 --> 00:32:28.678
Or was in an area with a higher concentration.

00:32:30.005 --> 00:32:33.113
And some people are just
extra sensitive to these irritants.

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:40.125
I had no idea they couldn't be mixed.

00:32:40.275 --> 00:32:41.805
I just saw them in the same bucket.

00:32:44.397 --> 00:32:46.125
Most people don't know.

00:32:46.633 --> 00:32:48.463
Which is why we keep seeing
reports of related deaths in the news.

00:32:48.755 --> 00:32:49.945
It can actually be fatal?

00:32:52.261 --> 00:32:55.611
In severe cases, it can
lead to respiratory failure.

00:32:56.695 --> 00:32:57.774
But as for 007,

00:32:58.501 --> 00:32:59.701
I think she'll be fine.

00:33:00.414 --> 00:33:02.393
She realized what was
happening in time and got out quickly.

00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:22.484
021, do you need anything else?

00:33:27.385 --> 00:33:28.108
P'Ngam.

00:33:28.905 --> 00:33:32.793
Could you please hide me in
the cart and take me out? I’m begging you.

00:33:32.945 --> 00:33:36.042
Oh, no way. It’s too risky.

00:33:37.145 --> 00:33:39.287
If we plan it carefully, no one will find out.

00:33:39.395 --> 00:33:42.619
- Please, I’m begging you.
- And where exactly are you going?

00:33:42.745 --> 00:33:44.153
Is it really that important?

00:33:46.105 --> 00:33:47.071
I’m worried

00:33:47.305 --> 00:33:48.365
about 007.

00:33:48.625 --> 00:33:49.638
I want to go visit her.

00:33:51.294 --> 00:33:53.445
But isn't 007 in the hospital

00:33:53.585 --> 00:33:54.776
because of you?

00:34:00.379 --> 00:34:02.251
You know about that?

00:34:03.065 --> 00:34:05.725
Oh, the whole center knows.

00:34:06.049 --> 00:34:08.400
And don't think I'm just
a housekeeper trying to lecture you

00:34:08.814 --> 00:34:11.746
If you sneak out to see your friend and get caught.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.868
Won't that just cause more trouble for your friend,

00:34:13.972 --> 00:34:16.118
yourself, and me too?

00:34:16.932 --> 00:34:18.550
I think if there's no other way,

00:34:18.745 --> 00:34:20.805
you should just be patient and
wait for your friend to return.

00:34:22.153 --> 00:34:23.325
Please give this to my friend.

00:34:53.225 --> 00:34:54.265
You can all eat now.

00:34:55.585 --> 00:34:56.825
Thank you.

00:35:46.585 --> 00:35:48.905
No, I just wanted to ask...

00:35:49.105 --> 00:35:51.611
- Have you ever heard of it?
- For real?

00:35:53.092 --> 00:35:54.772
- Take your pick.
- Hey.

00:35:57.461 --> 00:35:58.164
Let's go.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.838
Ugh, don't worry about Tarn. She's fine now.

00:36:30.985 --> 00:36:33.718
Look at her, eating like five months pregnant.

00:36:35.221 --> 00:36:36.581
How did this even happen, Tarn?

00:36:37.225 --> 00:36:39.127
You're usually such a careful person.

00:36:40.449 --> 00:36:43.398
Tarn wasn't the one who did it.

00:36:43.576 --> 00:36:46.665
Who did this to you? Just tell me.

00:36:46.785 --> 00:36:47.585
Who did this?

00:36:47.858 --> 00:36:50.918
Who's out to get you?
Just tell me, and I'll make them pay for it!

00:36:52.313 --> 00:36:53.012
Ugh!

00:36:53.785 --> 00:36:55.618
You don't have to report every single thing to him.

00:36:56.125 --> 00:36:58.348
- What, are you his wife or something?
- Crazy.

00:36:58.505 --> 00:37:01.461
I didn't report anything.
He just happened to call.

00:37:02.529 --> 00:37:06.654
Pete, I gotta go. Tarn is about to eat me alive.

00:37:07.045 --> 00:37:09.085
You take care of yourself too.

00:37:09.461 --> 00:37:10.605
Got it, wifey.

00:37:11.378 --> 00:37:12.407
Ew, I’m gonna puke!

00:37:14.985 --> 00:37:15.847
Oh, by the way

00:37:16.988 --> 00:37:18.299
How is 021 doing?

00:37:19.113 --> 00:37:20.965
Hmm.

00:37:21.746 --> 00:37:22.765
Are you worried about her?

00:37:38.865 --> 00:37:40.905
(Father)

00:37:46.705 --> 00:37:47.492
Hey.

00:37:47.823 --> 00:37:48.825
What are you doing?

00:37:50.065 --> 00:37:50.865
Hey.

00:37:52.084 --> 00:37:53.402
Help!

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:56.658
...This person always has to cause trouble?

00:37:56.705 --> 00:37:59.186
And why did 007 have to take the fall for her?

00:38:00.772 --> 00:38:02.428
What a waste for 007,

00:38:03.002 --> 00:38:04.498
she’s had a flawless record.

00:38:05.065 --> 00:38:06.685
Both here and in real life.

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:16.145
(Done with your training for today?)

00:38:17.305 --> 00:38:19.625
(Are you tired, sweetie?)

00:38:22.905 --> 00:38:26.865
(I am, but your daughter is a pro anyway.)

00:38:27.465 --> 00:38:30.465
(That’s why you're there, you're the best.)

00:38:33.225 --> 00:38:36.225
(More like best at causing trouble)

00:38:42.825 --> 00:38:45.825
(Then you must learn from your mistakes and fix it.)

00:38:51.705 --> 00:38:54.185
(I'm proud of you, Vicky.)

00:39:25.465 --> 00:39:26.105
Oh.

00:39:28.473 --> 00:39:29.458
Are you leaving already?

00:39:30.418 --> 00:39:32.745
My apologies, I just heard the news.

00:39:41.357 --> 00:39:42.289
Please don't trouble yourself.

00:39:43.454 --> 00:39:44.585
I wasn't seriously injured

00:39:52.518 --> 00:39:53.329
I see.

00:39:55.127 --> 00:39:56.414
You truly are a survivor.

00:39:57.785 --> 00:39:59.985
In truth, I’ve always admired you.

00:40:01.345 --> 00:40:04.230
Perhaps we should rekindle our old relationship?

00:40:09.105 --> 00:40:11.465
I have no desire to be anyone's enemy.

00:40:16.706 --> 00:40:19.145
My son just came back from abroad earlier this year.

00:40:20.348 --> 00:40:22.873
I'd like him to get to know your daughter.

00:40:23.858 --> 00:40:26.571
If the two of them like
each other. That would be wonderful.

00:40:30.299 --> 00:40:31.346
I’m sorry.

00:40:32.887 --> 00:40:35.082
I never interfere in my child's private life.

00:40:38.212 --> 00:40:40.456
Still, I’d like you to consider it.

00:40:42.191 --> 00:40:43.096
I’m sure you understand.

00:40:43.985 --> 00:40:47.385
this would be beneficial
for both of us in the long run.

00:41:16.021 --> 00:41:16.925
I apologize, Sir.

00:41:22.699 --> 00:41:24.675
Even though I know she's not seriously hurt.

00:41:25.078 --> 00:41:26.532
I still really want to visit her.

00:41:28.705 --> 00:41:31.040
I understand, but I'm not sure how I can help.

00:41:32.785 --> 00:41:34.598
Oh, there is one more way.

00:41:36.105 --> 00:41:40.125
This week's top scorer gets to leave the center.

00:41:42.115 --> 00:41:43.645
Are you serious, teacher?

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.298
But I'm not sure.

00:41:47.454 --> 00:41:48.710
How many people the instructor will allow.

00:41:49.225 --> 00:41:52.042
Sometimes it's two or three,
but sometimes it's just one.

00:41:58.425 --> 00:41:59.225
Start.

00:43:17.736 --> 00:43:19.645
Why is 007 in such a state?

00:43:23.265 --> 00:43:25.225
007 likely inhaled a lot of it.

00:43:26.031 --> 00:43:28.785
Or was in an area with a higher concentration.

00:43:30.945 --> 00:43:32.000
I’m worried

00:43:32.174 --> 00:43:33.315
- about 007.
- Hey.

00:43:33.454 --> 00:43:34.645
I want to go visit her.

00:43:57.078 --> 00:43:58.818
If you encounter someone bigger

00:43:59.465 --> 00:44:03.892
or stronger, The legs are
the base, and they are the weakness.

00:44:13.677 --> 00:44:14.445
021

00:44:15.353 --> 00:44:16.258
is the winner.

00:44:18.745 --> 00:44:20.985
One slip-up and you'll be at a disadvantage.

00:44:21.837 --> 00:44:22.915
You must use your wits.

00:44:23.663 --> 00:44:25.051
And strike the enemy immediately.

00:44:26.442 --> 00:44:27.185
Hey.

00:44:31.265 --> 00:44:32.244
Stop.

00:44:33.336 --> 00:44:34.685
021 is the winner.

00:44:51.665 --> 00:44:52.911
This is how you should attack

00:45:11.305 --> 00:45:12.178
Stop.

00:45:13.245 --> 00:45:15.005
021 is the winner.

00:45:21.205 --> 00:45:24.637
Those with the highest scores in both practical

00:45:25.065 --> 00:45:26.348
and academic assessments

00:45:26.866 --> 00:45:28.369
ranking in the top three

00:45:28.678 --> 00:45:29.757
will receive a reward.

00:45:31.505 --> 00:45:32.546
In first place

00:45:35.266 --> 00:45:36.487
009.

00:45:41.145 --> 00:45:42.484
In second place.

00:45:43.972 --> 00:45:44.807
014

00:45:49.315 --> 00:45:50.619
As for third place.

00:45:51.322 --> 00:45:54.007
We have a tie between two people."

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.656
The first one is

00:45:58.612 --> 00:46:00.574
011

00:46:04.567 --> 00:46:05.732
And the second one is

00:46:10.865 --> 00:46:14.157
The doctor said you should stay
until Sunday. Why the rush to leave, huh?

00:46:16.225 --> 00:46:17.256
Or

00:46:18.313 --> 00:46:19.343
is it because of someone?

00:46:20.825 --> 00:46:21.732
Who are you worried about?

00:46:22.786 --> 00:46:23.465
Who is it?

00:46:25.265 --> 00:46:26.543
I'm worried about my classes.

00:46:26.905 --> 00:46:28.400
I've got a lot of catching up to do.

00:46:28.706 --> 00:46:29.851
Ugh.

00:46:30.049 --> 00:46:32.692
Pete and I had it all planned out.
We were supposed to go out today.

00:46:33.454 --> 00:46:35.525
- Can't you head back to the center tomorrow instead?
- Umm.

00:46:36.178 --> 00:46:36.814
True.

00:46:41.425 --> 00:46:42.838
And the second one is

00:46:43.945 --> 00:46:44.793
021

00:46:46.465 --> 00:46:47.265
Me?

00:46:49.158 --> 00:46:50.146
Are you sure?

00:46:59.885 --> 00:47:00.925
Hey, Tarn.

00:47:01.565 --> 00:47:05.284
A few days ago, news broke that
Deputy Phakphum's car was hit downtown.

00:47:05.847 --> 00:47:07.082
Ken said

00:47:07.732 --> 00:47:09.065
it looked like an attempted assassination.

00:47:10.442 --> 00:47:12.025
But luckily, the Deputy is doing okay.

00:47:20.574 --> 00:47:21.398
You.

00:48:28.136 --> 00:48:29.795
Because I wanted to apologize to you.

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:33.433
I kept telling myself to get the best scores possible.

00:48:37.405 --> 00:48:38.884
Not only are you a great driver,

00:48:39.131 --> 00:48:41.336
but you also have such strong determination.

00:48:42.059 --> 00:48:43.757
I'm so proud of you.

00:48:45.305 --> 00:48:47.607
I can't believe I did it either.

00:48:48.884 --> 00:48:50.296
I feel much more confident now.

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:53.774
As for the final practical exam before graduation.

00:48:54.105 --> 00:48:55.565
I believe you'll do just as well.

00:48:59.425 --> 00:48:59.934
An exam?

00:49:00.705 --> 00:49:01.715
What's the topic this time?

00:49:03.065 --> 00:49:05.875
The instructors will create unique
simulated scenarios for each team.

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:08.085
A team?

00:49:09.913 --> 00:49:11.795
Am I going to be a burden again?

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:16.494
Then how about we practice more?

00:49:17.684 --> 00:49:20.911
So you'll feel confident when we're actually in the field.

00:49:22.873 --> 00:49:27.025
Did you hear that? Let's practice together.

00:49:28.428 --> 00:49:29.621
My heart is melting.

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:35.625
what are you teasing me about?

00:49:38.885 --> 00:49:39.711
Anyway guys.

00:49:40.619 --> 00:49:42.031
I don't want to go back to the center today.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.751
- Whoa, Why?
- I don't want to go back.

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.565
- Do you have a fever?
- You were literally just sick a moment ago.

00:49:47.673 --> 00:49:48.525
Right?

00:49:48.945 --> 00:49:50.814
- And you're planning to teach her.
- Yeah.

00:50:24.945 --> 00:50:29.025
Our training mission is to protect and rescue a VIP.

00:50:29.211 --> 00:50:30.546
Who is trapped inside a warehouse.

00:50:30.971 --> 00:50:33.238
And evacuate them from the field safely.

00:50:33.945 --> 00:50:36.305
I'll play the role of the VIP who needs protection.

00:50:37.364 --> 00:50:39.945
I’ll be the opposition unit
trying to intercept the VIP protection.

00:50:40.385 --> 00:50:43.905
I'm on the support team,
responsible for covering the rear.

00:50:44.625 --> 00:50:45.538
And

00:50:45.896 --> 00:50:49.197
I am the mission leader and the frontline guard.

00:50:49.593 --> 00:50:51.298
Tasked with clearing the path ahead.

00:50:51.545 --> 00:50:54.085
Securing the route before the team reaches the VIP.

00:51:02.545 --> 00:51:03.345
Clear.

00:51:16.865 --> 00:51:17.665
Keep moving.

00:51:24.985 --> 00:51:25.705
Target spotted.

00:51:28.595 --> 00:51:29.958
Clear. Proceed.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.715
- Bang!
- Hey.

00:51:56.385 --> 00:51:57.551
Hey, Tarn.

00:51:58.042 --> 00:52:00.776
I'm the VIP! Aren't you
supposed to be protecting me?

00:52:02.971 --> 00:52:03.583
Sorry.

00:52:05.419 --> 00:52:06.014
Oh wow.

00:52:07.023 --> 00:52:08.665
This wasn't the plan.

00:52:10.265 --> 00:52:12.595
So what? Couldn't be helped?

00:52:16.258 --> 00:52:18.164
forget it. Let's go again.

00:52:18.612 --> 00:52:19.315
Ugh.

00:52:20.654 --> 00:52:21.562
What?

00:52:22.223 --> 00:52:23.200
Start over.

00:52:23.861 --> 00:52:24.574
Try again.

00:52:37.105 --> 00:52:40.028
The final exam mission is a hostage rescue.

00:52:40.494 --> 00:52:43.285
Participants will be divided into teams of three.

00:52:43.652 --> 00:52:45.687
Enemies will be hiding around various corners.

00:52:47.065 --> 00:52:51.298
If a participant is hit by the opposing
side, they must exit the match immediately.

00:52:55.805 --> 00:52:56.710
Queue one.

00:52:56.964 --> 00:52:57.927
Clear.

00:53:00.637 --> 00:53:01.447
Proceed.

00:53:10.932 --> 00:53:11.593
Clear.

00:53:15.698 --> 00:53:16.633
Front clear.

00:53:20.578 --> 00:53:21.225
Hey.

00:53:28.153 --> 00:53:29.398
Queue two clear.

00:53:37.426 --> 00:53:38.244
Proceed.

00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:51.433
Queue three clear.

00:53:59.339 --> 00:54:00.539
Hostage rescued successfully.

00:54:00.619 --> 00:54:01.927
Mission accomplished.

00:54:17.665 --> 00:54:18.828
Yay!

00:54:18.911 --> 00:54:19.823
Can you promise me.

00:54:20.785 --> 00:54:22.021
That once we leave this place.

00:54:22.785 --> 00:54:23.917
We'll still be friends?

00:54:25.924 --> 00:54:28.571
I know you're threatening me, sir.

00:54:29.242 --> 00:54:30.630
If you don't want to end up in prison

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:32.369
sooner than you should.

00:54:32.685 --> 00:54:34.000
Stay away from my daughter.

00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:35.771
Today,

00:54:36.282 --> 00:54:37.273
my daughter

00:54:38.397 --> 00:54:39.605
is here as well.

00:54:40.167 --> 00:54:41.985
Her code is 021.

00:54:44.647 --> 00:54:46.265
Phavika Ratchanon.
