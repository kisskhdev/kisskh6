{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:37.825
You instigated all the devotees
and backed her into a corner.

00:01:37.905 --> 00:01:39.305
There might be no blood on your hands,

00:01:39.385 --> 00:01:41.225
but can you truly say
that you committed no wrongdoing?

00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:44.305
But I didn't kill her.

00:01:44.385 --> 00:01:46.745
Even if you take me to His Majesty,

00:01:46.825 --> 00:01:48.825
I am still innocent.

00:01:50.345 --> 00:01:52.465
Killing someone
gets you the death penalty.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.305
Extensive abuse
of witchcraft in the palace

00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:55.385
also gets you the death penalty.

00:01:55.985 --> 00:01:57.905
Just now, you confessed to all of them.

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:05.785
- I didn't!
- Back off!

00:02:10.024 --> 00:02:11.024
Your Ladyship.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:13.185
I didn't.

00:02:14.025 --> 00:02:16.505
It was Gonglian.
It was Gonglian. Your Ladyship.

00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:18.745
- It wasn't me.
- Take him away.

00:02:19.345 --> 00:02:21.185
- Yes.
- It was all Gonglian!

00:02:21.265 --> 00:02:23.505
I didn't do it. I didn't do it!

00:02:36.385 --> 00:02:38.385
- He escaped?
- Yes.

00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:52.945
White Asura?

00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:57.505
White Asura.

00:02:58.385 --> 00:02:59.465
For you.

00:03:04.345 --> 00:03:06.105
Is this rouge for me?

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:07.305
Yes.

00:03:07.945 --> 00:03:11.185
Use it and your eyes will return.

00:03:13.825 --> 00:03:16.065
My eyes will return.

00:03:18.185 --> 00:03:20.025
No! I don't want it!

00:03:22.465 --> 00:03:26.145
A girl said you'd only return my eyes

00:03:27.105 --> 00:03:28.625
if she died.

00:03:30.305 --> 00:03:31.145
And then?

00:03:31.865 --> 00:03:34.025
Of course, I couldn't let her die.

00:03:34.825 --> 00:03:36.425
I said I didn't want her help.

00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:40.105
Supervisor Luo will treat me
when he comes back anyway.

00:03:41.185 --> 00:03:44.385
I've returned it to you.
I don't want you to treat my eyes.

00:03:45.145 --> 00:03:48.665
Then, can you not let her die?

00:03:48.745 --> 00:03:49.585
Please.

00:03:51.385 --> 00:03:53.745
Where did she go? Why did she die?

00:03:55.065 --> 00:03:56.665
She didn't die.

00:03:57.505 --> 00:03:59.185
She said she was tired

00:03:59.265 --> 00:04:01.105
and wanted to take a break.

00:04:02.465 --> 00:04:03.305
And then?

00:04:03.385 --> 00:04:04.625
Then,

00:04:07.105 --> 00:04:08.825
she turned into a bird

00:04:09.425 --> 00:04:10.785
and flew away.

00:04:11.545 --> 00:04:13.185
She flew away.

00:04:14.105 --> 00:04:15.985
You look a little like her.

00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:17.825
Do you know her?

00:04:19.905 --> 00:04:21.105
Her name is…

00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:24.305
Her name is…

00:04:25.305 --> 00:04:26.345
Her name is…

00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:30.105
Gonglian.

00:04:31.265 --> 00:04:32.105
Gonglian.

00:04:34.865 --> 00:04:35.705
White Asura.

00:04:37.025 --> 00:04:38.305
We finally meet.

00:04:39.465 --> 00:04:40.945
Why are you here?

00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:42.985
He also wanted to see a deity,

00:04:43.065 --> 00:04:44.945
so I asked him to hide here.

00:04:45.465 --> 00:04:47.705
She was never affected
by your and Wang Anping's hypnosis.

00:04:48.465 --> 00:04:49.785
She is just naive.

00:04:50.385 --> 00:04:52.425
She trusts everything she sees and hears.

00:04:53.145 --> 00:04:54.465
This rouge contains poison.

00:04:55.705 --> 00:04:58.945
You want to poison Talent Dong
to avenge Gonglian.

00:04:59.025 --> 00:05:01.465
She is not the accomplice
to your sister's murder.

00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:03.225
Come to the Palace Investigation Bureau
with me.

00:05:13.025 --> 00:05:15.465
We've been waiting for you, White Asura.

00:05:16.425 --> 00:05:17.385
I'm not trying to escape.

00:05:17.465 --> 00:05:18.505
I know.

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:21.985
You want to jump down from here
like your sister did.

00:05:27.545 --> 00:05:28.385
It's really high.

00:05:28.465 --> 00:05:30.985
She must have been very afraid
when she stood here.

00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:34.265
However, there was something
even scarier behind her.

00:05:34.345 --> 00:05:37.545
She was cornered
and could only jump down from here.

00:05:37.625 --> 00:05:40.305
You aren't the one
who drove Gonglian to her death.

00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:41.545
You've always tried to save her.

00:05:43.465 --> 00:05:44.825
I know everything,

00:05:46.505 --> 00:05:47.625
but I failed to save her.

00:05:48.905 --> 00:05:52.225
Those people have been consumed
by their obsession with White Asura.

00:05:53.545 --> 00:05:55.865
Why did Wang Anping
want her dead so badly?

00:05:56.985 --> 00:06:01.785
Because a person's desire is insatiable.

00:06:01.865 --> 00:06:02.905
People always want more.

00:06:02.985 --> 00:06:05.665
In the beginning,
everyone only asked White Asura

00:06:05.745 --> 00:06:07.025
to bless them with life-saving herbs,

00:06:07.105 --> 00:06:08.865
enough charcoal to last the winter,

00:06:10.025 --> 00:06:11.665
or an opportunity
to return home to see their family.

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:13.345
But slowly…

00:06:14.105 --> 00:06:15.145
These are the wishes

00:06:15.225 --> 00:06:16.745
they left for White Asura
in the past few days.

00:06:17.345 --> 00:06:19.585
Make some arrangements
and see what you can do.

00:06:19.665 --> 00:06:20.505
WHITE ASURA, PLEASE MAKE HIM LOSE HIS
RIGHT HAND AS A PUNISHMENT FOR BULLYING ME

00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:21.505
I WAS PUNISHED BY SUPERINTENDENT
DAY AND NIGHT FOR BREAKING A CERAMIC

00:06:22.585 --> 00:06:23.585
They want to hurt people.

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:28.465
He is being bullied
at the Imperial Food Service.

00:06:29.065 --> 00:06:33.225
First, he had hot oil poured on his hand,
and he almost lost his ability to cook.

00:06:33.305 --> 00:06:34.585
GONGLIAN, PALACE MAID

00:06:35.865 --> 00:06:37.385
This man is even more unfortunate.

00:06:37.465 --> 00:06:39.865
He's not good with words
and offended the superintendent.

00:06:39.945 --> 00:06:42.705
He was not allowed to wash his robes
with hot water in the winter,

00:06:42.785 --> 00:06:44.465
and he ended up
with frostbite on both hands.

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:47.305
Poor soul.

00:06:49.425 --> 00:06:51.025
But it doesn't justify the wish
to make a colleague lose an arm

00:06:51.105 --> 00:06:52.065
or harm the superintendent.

00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:55.545
It's just a small punishment.
A small punishment.

00:06:57.825 --> 00:06:59.545
They are very pious.

00:06:59.625 --> 00:07:01.825
They have also helped others a lot.

00:07:03.945 --> 00:07:07.505
Perhaps you can think about
how you can help them

00:07:07.585 --> 00:07:09.225
so they are not disheartened.

00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:13.105
What are you doing? Gonglian.

00:07:16.945 --> 00:07:17.785
No wonder.

00:07:18.425 --> 00:07:20.265
I heard you've been
very generous recently.

00:07:20.345 --> 00:07:21.825
It's like you've found a way
to make money.

00:07:21.905 --> 00:07:22.825
Not so loud!

00:07:22.905 --> 00:07:25.785
It turns out
you've been taking money in secret.

00:07:25.865 --> 00:07:28.745
Is this how they show their devotion?

00:07:28.825 --> 00:07:30.705
Is this the reason why you must help them?

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.625
We did them a huge favor.

00:07:33.705 --> 00:07:35.425
What's wrong with taking
some tokens of gratitude?

00:07:35.505 --> 00:07:38.145
Did I force them to pay me?
They paid me willingly!

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:39.785
If you want it,

00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:42.225
I'll give half the money to you.

00:07:42.865 --> 00:07:44.825
You are ridiculous.

00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:49.305
For money, you are trying to harm people.

00:07:49.905 --> 00:07:51.185
I'm here

00:07:51.785 --> 00:07:54.425
because I want to discuss this with you.

00:07:56.145 --> 00:07:57.265
You have no idea

00:07:57.345 --> 00:07:59.185
how badly they were
bullied and humiliated.

00:07:59.265 --> 00:08:02.905
Not only must we promote good,
but also punish evil.

00:08:04.905 --> 00:08:06.545
What if the poisoned superintendent

00:08:06.625 --> 00:08:09.785
turns to White Asura
to punish the person who harmed her?

00:08:10.665 --> 00:08:11.505
Then…

00:08:12.665 --> 00:08:14.145
That depends…

00:08:14.225 --> 00:08:15.585
What if the superintendent

00:08:15.665 --> 00:08:18.145
pays you double
what these people paid you?

00:08:20.225 --> 00:08:21.625
This is not about money.

00:08:23.185 --> 00:08:24.505
Return the money to them.

00:08:24.585 --> 00:08:26.625
You should also take these requests away.

00:08:32.225 --> 00:08:33.144
Fine.

00:08:35.305 --> 00:08:36.825
As you said,

00:08:36.904 --> 00:08:40.185
we won't do anything that harms anyone.

00:08:42.945 --> 00:08:45.105
However, you should take a look

00:08:45.185 --> 00:08:47.905
at these remaining requests
and think of something to help them.

00:08:54.905 --> 00:08:56.585
Somehow, at some point,

00:08:57.105 --> 00:08:58.905
the requests have started to change.

00:08:59.785 --> 00:09:01.385
They ask for better lives,

00:09:01.905 --> 00:09:04.065
more opportunities to be promoted,

00:09:04.145 --> 00:09:06.585
and misfortune for the people
who are a threat to them.

00:09:06.665 --> 00:09:09.225
I believe they are all suffering,

00:09:09.305 --> 00:09:10.785
but how come we get to decide

00:09:10.865 --> 00:09:13.665
what they should want
and what they should receive?

00:09:15.185 --> 00:09:16.785
Hey! Hey…

00:09:17.865 --> 00:09:19.185
You…

00:09:19.265 --> 00:09:20.705
What about me?

00:09:21.225 --> 00:09:25.465
Everyone thought that White Asura
was an omnipotent deity.

00:09:25.545 --> 00:09:26.865
But Gonglian knew

00:09:27.545 --> 00:09:30.025
that humans created this deity.

00:09:30.105 --> 00:09:32.985
Those who helped them fulfill their wishes
were also humans.

00:09:33.585 --> 00:09:35.065
Gonglian's original intention

00:09:35.145 --> 00:09:37.625
was to weave a web of kindness
for everyone to help each other.

00:09:37.705 --> 00:09:39.145
However,

00:09:39.225 --> 00:09:41.305
as the devotees trusted
White Asura more and more,

00:09:41.385 --> 00:09:45.345
this web of kindness
also attracted greed and evil.

00:09:45.425 --> 00:09:47.665
The two requests to harm people

00:09:48.265 --> 00:09:49.785
deeply hurt Gonglian.

00:10:06.465 --> 00:10:09.105
Gonglian, don't overthink.

00:10:09.825 --> 00:10:10.865
Fuqu.

00:10:11.665 --> 00:10:14.505
Tell me. Have I done something wrong?

00:10:15.305 --> 00:10:16.385
You did nothing wrong.

00:10:17.265 --> 00:10:18.985
You only wanted to help others.

00:10:21.185 --> 00:10:23.105
If you don't want
to do it anymore, just stop.

00:10:27.785 --> 00:10:29.065
Gonglian knew

00:10:29.145 --> 00:10:31.545
that people would have
all kinds of wishes and desires.

00:10:32.145 --> 00:10:34.545
She also understood
that she had no right to decide

00:10:34.625 --> 00:10:37.385
what kind of wishes
they could make to White Asura.

00:10:37.985 --> 00:10:40.825
She also had no right
to judge these wishes.

00:10:40.905 --> 00:10:42.825
Gonglian was hesitant at first.

00:10:43.425 --> 00:10:44.785
Three days later,

00:10:44.865 --> 00:10:46.985
she heard the superintendent
of the Imperial Laundry

00:10:47.065 --> 00:10:48.705
had fallen unconscious
after drinking the water

00:10:48.785 --> 00:10:51.385
made from heartbreak grass,
which she had mistaken for honeysuckle.

00:10:51.465 --> 00:10:54.985
Then, she decided
to put an end to everything.

00:10:55.065 --> 00:10:57.065
But Wang Anping was already absorbed

00:10:57.145 --> 00:10:59.785
in the glory and vanity
brought to him by White Asura's identity.

00:11:00.425 --> 00:11:03.385
He would never agree
to Gonglian's decision easily.

00:11:04.025 --> 00:11:07.545
Because White Asura would no longer exist
without Gonglian.

00:11:12.185 --> 00:11:14.825
Wang Anping tried threatening
and bribing her,

00:11:14.905 --> 00:11:16.225
but Gonglian wouldn't budge.

00:11:16.305 --> 00:11:19.585
She did not believe Wang Anping
could wield the influence he had properly.

00:11:19.665 --> 00:11:22.625
She told Wang Anping
that if he wouldn't stop,

00:11:22.705 --> 00:11:25.265
she would expose
all the witchcraft he did in the palace.

00:11:25.865 --> 00:11:29.065
Gonglian even burned the records

00:11:29.145 --> 00:11:31.385
of the requests of White Asura's devotees
and where they were working.

00:11:31.465 --> 00:11:35.225
Wang Anping was furious
and said he would never forgive Gonglian.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:38.385
He lied and told everyone
that Gonglian could summon White Asura

00:11:38.465 --> 00:11:40.105
so that the devotees
would drive her to her death.

00:11:41.545 --> 00:11:44.585
In the beginning,
they came to congratulate Gonglian

00:11:45.345 --> 00:11:48.305
and showed her great envy and expectation.

00:11:48.385 --> 00:11:50.985
Gonglian knew
it was all a plot by Wang Anping.

00:11:51.065 --> 00:11:52.825
So she wasn't willing to die.

00:11:52.905 --> 00:11:55.825
She even told these people
that White Asura appeared in their dreams

00:11:55.905 --> 00:11:58.025
because hypnosis was used
to show what was in their hearts.

00:11:59.025 --> 00:12:00.305
However, no one believed her.

00:12:00.385 --> 00:12:01.465
Yes.

00:12:01.545 --> 00:12:04.385
Because all of them
were being helped before.

00:12:05.145 --> 00:12:08.145
They received White Asura's "favors".

00:12:08.225 --> 00:12:09.265
So,

00:12:09.865 --> 00:12:14.465
they drove a person to her death
for an imaginary deity.

00:12:15.305 --> 00:12:16.745
They drove a person
who helped them sincerely,

00:12:16.825 --> 00:12:19.585
without asking for anything
in return, to her death.

00:13:01.465 --> 00:13:02.465
Am I pretty?

00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:40.785
Gonglian.

00:13:58.785 --> 00:14:00.185
Please let me go.

00:14:01.025 --> 00:14:02.425
Devotee Gonglian,

00:14:02.505 --> 00:14:06.065
summon White Asura now.
You won't be so lucky next time.

00:14:44.305 --> 00:14:45.545
Gonglian.

00:14:45.625 --> 00:14:46.825
It's me!

00:14:46.905 --> 00:14:49.145
It's me. What's wrong?

00:14:49.225 --> 00:14:51.025
Did you hear that?

00:14:52.905 --> 00:14:56.505
They said they were coming to kill me.

00:14:59.345 --> 00:15:01.105
Gonglian, don't be afraid.

00:15:05.505 --> 00:15:09.425
I wanted to kill them,
but I didn't know who they were.

00:15:10.025 --> 00:15:11.745
I wanted to have a word with Wang Anping,

00:15:11.825 --> 00:15:13.585
but Gonglian wouldn't let me expose him.

00:15:13.665 --> 00:15:16.025
She said she'd do her best to endure it.

00:15:16.105 --> 00:15:18.945
She added that if she were
driven to death by Wang Anping,

00:15:19.025 --> 00:15:21.305
I had to protect myself no matter what

00:15:21.825 --> 00:15:23.745
and expose Wang Anping.

00:15:27.745 --> 00:15:31.585
You already know what happened after that.

00:15:34.625 --> 00:15:35.745
Gonglian

00:15:37.705 --> 00:15:40.025
was still driven to death by them.

00:15:46.385 --> 00:15:49.185
Not only do I want to expose Wang Anping,

00:15:49.265 --> 00:15:51.025
but I also want to avenge Gonglian.

00:15:51.665 --> 00:15:53.105
You planned patiently for two years,

00:15:53.945 --> 00:15:56.145
found the people who drove
Gonglian to her death back then,

00:15:56.225 --> 00:15:58.225
and pretended to be
a huge devotee of White Asura

00:15:58.305 --> 00:16:00.265
to obtain Wang Anping's trust.

00:16:01.945 --> 00:16:04.065
Wang Anping only cares about money.

00:16:04.145 --> 00:16:07.665
As long as I fan the faith these devotees
have in White Asura,

00:16:07.745 --> 00:16:10.305
as long as I can keep making
these devotees offer him money,

00:16:10.385 --> 00:16:11.625
he'd do anything.

00:16:13.785 --> 00:16:15.465
Those devotees are just the same.

00:16:16.105 --> 00:16:20.025
They only care about whether White Asura
can grant their wish or not.

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:21.745
They didn't even remember

00:16:21.825 --> 00:16:24.625
how they drove
a living person to her death.

00:16:25.225 --> 00:16:27.305
They even blamed her for dying too late,

00:16:27.385 --> 00:16:29.505
thus ruining White Asura's incarnation.

00:16:31.345 --> 00:16:33.465
I learned Wang Anping's
dream-appearing technique.

00:16:33.545 --> 00:16:36.265
I wanted everyone
who drove Gonglian to death

00:16:36.345 --> 00:16:38.265
to summon White Asura themselves.

00:16:38.345 --> 00:16:40.225
None of them would be willing to die.

00:16:40.825 --> 00:16:41.985
They still have things they want.

00:16:42.065 --> 00:16:43.905
This is why they are pretentious.

00:16:43.985 --> 00:16:45.905
I helped them get their wishes,

00:16:45.985 --> 00:16:49.265
and they looked so pious
before White Asura.

00:16:49.985 --> 00:16:52.985
Just like how they drove
Gonglian to death back then.

00:16:54.145 --> 00:16:56.505
But when I entered
their dreams as White Asura

00:16:56.585 --> 00:16:59.905
and told them they were chosen
to summon White Asura…

00:17:00.505 --> 00:17:02.225
None of them was willing to die.

00:17:03.345 --> 00:17:07.025
They were so sure and confident back then,

00:17:07.105 --> 00:17:09.625
but when it was their turn,
their expressions changed.

00:17:10.305 --> 00:17:12.464
They were afraid, scared,

00:17:12.545 --> 00:17:14.505
and still felt they were lucky.

00:17:14.585 --> 00:17:16.704
They owed their lives to Gonglian!

00:17:18.985 --> 00:17:22.985
So, you threatened them
with the things they cared about most.

00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:25.625
You used Pan Yongqi's son to threaten him.

00:17:51.745 --> 00:17:54.465
You used the White Peony Balm
to hurt Dianjiang's hand.

00:18:06.785 --> 00:18:10.025
As for Luo Zhian, you took some effort.

00:18:10.105 --> 00:18:12.905
You made Luo Zhian
earn Consort Shu's favor.

00:18:12.985 --> 00:18:15.745
Although that made him
believe in White Asura even more,

00:18:15.825 --> 00:18:17.425
it'd be more difficult
to make him die willingly

00:18:17.505 --> 00:18:19.265
when he was at the peak of his glory.

00:18:19.345 --> 00:18:23.465
So, you let him take the Yin-Yang Road
so he could meet Talent Dong.

00:18:24.745 --> 00:18:26.265
I can't hide anything
from you, Your Ladyship.

00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:30.505
He administered acupuncture privately,
which resulted in a consort's blindness.

00:18:30.585 --> 00:18:32.945
Once this incident was exposed,
no one in the palace

00:18:33.545 --> 00:18:35.345
would dare to hire him,
let alone Consort Shu.

00:18:35.945 --> 00:18:37.425
Not only would his reputation be ruined,

00:18:37.505 --> 00:18:39.145
but his whole family
would also be caught up in it.

00:18:39.225 --> 00:18:40.785
He could either commit suicide

00:18:40.865 --> 00:18:43.385
or his whole family
could die together with him.

00:18:43.465 --> 00:18:46.465
You planned to drive every murderer
of Gonglian to death.

00:18:47.385 --> 00:18:49.545
Later, you pinned the crime
of inciting others to suicide

00:18:49.625 --> 00:18:50.985
on Wang Anping.

00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:52.345
You are very smart.

00:18:52.945 --> 00:18:54.385
Your Ladyship, aren't you curious?

00:18:55.225 --> 00:18:57.785
If I wanted to take revenge
by persuading others to commit suicide,

00:18:57.865 --> 00:19:00.105
why would I use such a complicated method?

00:19:02.745 --> 00:19:04.545
Death only happens in a moment.

00:19:05.265 --> 00:19:08.145
However, knowing that one
will die at a certain time,

00:19:08.665 --> 00:19:10.985
it'll make living a form of torture.

00:19:11.065 --> 00:19:14.505
Every second of Pan Yongqi
in the prison was filled with anxiety,

00:19:15.105 --> 00:19:17.425
every step Luo Zhian
took on the Yin-Yang Road,

00:19:17.505 --> 00:19:21.025
and inch by inch,
the rope sank into Dianjiang's skin.

00:19:21.105 --> 00:19:22.905
They were the punishment you gave them.

00:19:22.985 --> 00:19:24.825
Not only did you want them dead,

00:19:25.625 --> 00:19:26.985
you wanted them to feel

00:19:27.065 --> 00:19:28.065
the pain Gonglian
suffered before her death.

00:19:28.145 --> 00:19:30.025
That is your real revenge.

00:19:36.465 --> 00:19:37.865
You've seen through everything.

00:19:38.625 --> 00:19:39.665
So,

00:19:40.705 --> 00:19:42.665
did you release me from the Palace
Investigation Bureau on purpose?

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:44.105
Yes.

00:19:44.785 --> 00:19:46.585
I knew you didn't believe in White Asura.

00:19:46.665 --> 00:19:48.665
You pretended like
you were committing suicide

00:19:48.745 --> 00:19:51.065
because you wanted us
to let our guard down

00:19:51.145 --> 00:19:52.985
so you could have more time to kill.

00:19:53.905 --> 00:19:56.505
I've seen many devotees of White Asura

00:19:56.585 --> 00:19:58.265
and practiced it many times.

00:19:58.345 --> 00:19:59.465
How did you find out?

00:19:59.545 --> 00:20:00.825
The feather.

00:20:00.905 --> 00:20:02.145
Feather?

00:20:04.945 --> 00:20:06.385
No!

00:20:07.705 --> 00:20:11.705
Every devotee saw the feather
as an embodiment of White Asura.

00:20:11.785 --> 00:20:13.385
When you saw
that I wanted to burn the feather,

00:20:13.465 --> 00:20:14.585
you went mad.

00:20:14.665 --> 00:20:16.585
But after you put up
your act of committing suicide,

00:20:16.665 --> 00:20:19.785
you were sure that I was fooled
and left the feather on the table.

00:20:25.705 --> 00:20:27.465
You didn't even look at the feather once.

00:20:29.785 --> 00:20:31.225
I was too impatient.

00:20:33.825 --> 00:20:34.665
Come with me.

00:20:35.785 --> 00:20:36.745
Your Ladyship.

00:20:38.145 --> 00:20:39.025
Can I…

00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:40.825
I won't let you jump down from here.

00:20:40.905 --> 00:20:43.345
I have to die anyway.

00:20:43.425 --> 00:20:47.345
Please. Let me die here
just like Gonglian did.

00:20:52.745 --> 00:20:54.385
You really like Lady in Snow a lot.

00:20:54.465 --> 00:20:57.385
This feather dress is pretty.

00:21:04.425 --> 00:21:06.585
I also hope that White Asura exists.

00:21:09.625 --> 00:21:10.985
If it's possible,

00:21:11.585 --> 00:21:12.625
let my sister and me

00:21:12.705 --> 00:21:15.425
be the birds
beside Consort Shu in our next lives

00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:16.945
so we won't have to suffer so much.

00:21:25.025 --> 00:21:26.185
If you die now,

00:21:27.065 --> 00:21:30.145
all your previous efforts
would be in vain.

00:21:32.225 --> 00:21:33.905
Wang Anping's only crime now

00:21:33.985 --> 00:21:36.065
is setting up
private altars for witchcraft

00:21:36.145 --> 00:21:37.185
in the palace.

00:21:37.265 --> 00:21:40.785
You are the only person who can prove
that he caused Gonglian's death.

00:21:46.625 --> 00:21:50.145
Did Talent Dong tell you
how Gonglian died?

00:22:10.465 --> 00:22:12.705
Everyone wants me to die, even you?

00:22:17.705 --> 00:22:19.705
White Asura told me

00:22:19.785 --> 00:22:23.465
I could get my eyes back
as long as I frightened you.

00:22:29.665 --> 00:22:33.665
You can only get back your eyes
when I die.

00:22:37.945 --> 00:22:39.145
What?

00:22:41.265 --> 00:22:43.305
White Asura probably said

00:22:44.025 --> 00:22:45.425
you could only get back your eyes

00:22:46.025 --> 00:22:47.945
if I died.

00:22:49.225 --> 00:22:51.065
I can only get back my eyes

00:22:51.665 --> 00:22:54.065
when you die?

00:22:56.065 --> 00:22:56.905
When you die…

00:22:59.065 --> 00:23:00.065
Then…

00:23:00.145 --> 00:23:01.985
Then, I don't want my eyes.

00:23:02.065 --> 00:23:03.625
I don't want you to die.

00:23:04.225 --> 00:23:07.265
When Medical Supervisor Luo returns,

00:23:07.345 --> 00:23:09.425
he can treat my eyes anyway.

00:23:09.505 --> 00:23:13.625
Then, His Majesty can visit me every day.

00:23:15.705 --> 00:23:17.185
Am I pretty?

00:23:18.305 --> 00:23:21.265
Am I pretty?

00:23:21.345 --> 00:23:23.585
Am I pretty?

00:23:25.745 --> 00:23:26.945
You are pretty.

00:23:27.465 --> 00:23:28.625
Very pretty.

00:23:29.945 --> 00:23:31.185
I'm very pretty.

00:23:31.265 --> 00:23:32.705
I'm very pretty.

00:23:32.785 --> 00:23:34.025
I'm very pretty.

00:23:38.065 --> 00:23:40.105
Where are you going?

00:23:44.265 --> 00:23:45.105
I'm tired.

00:23:46.265 --> 00:23:47.465
I want to take a break.

00:23:48.145 --> 00:23:49.505
Talent Dong,

00:23:49.585 --> 00:23:52.585
don't go to the Yin-Yang Road
to look at the paintings today.

00:23:52.665 --> 00:23:54.305
Go back and rest in the palace. All right?

00:23:55.025 --> 00:23:55.905
Why?

00:23:58.425 --> 00:24:01.825
Make sure you are well-rested.
His Majesty is visiting you tomorrow.

00:24:04.105 --> 00:24:06.065
His Majesty is visiting me tomorrow?

00:24:06.145 --> 00:24:08.665
I must go back and sleep.

00:24:08.745 --> 00:24:10.545
His Majesty is visiting me tomorrow!

00:24:10.625 --> 00:24:13.345
I must sleep well!

00:24:13.425 --> 00:24:15.625
His Majesty is visiting me tomorrow!

00:24:15.705 --> 00:24:17.665
I must sleep well!

00:25:15.745 --> 00:25:17.185
It's getting cold.

00:25:18.465 --> 00:25:19.665
You should go back.

00:25:21.905 --> 00:25:25.105
If White Asura
could grant a wish for real,

00:25:26.505 --> 00:25:28.145
what would you wish for?

00:25:33.025 --> 00:25:34.625
I hope you can get your wish.

00:25:38.145 --> 00:25:40.705
But I don't know what wish I should make.

00:25:42.025 --> 00:25:43.665
There are too many things I want to change

00:25:43.745 --> 00:25:45.505
and people I want to save.

00:25:45.585 --> 00:25:46.705
Besides,

00:25:47.545 --> 00:25:51.225
if everyone in the world
could have their selfish wishes granted,

00:25:51.745 --> 00:25:54.425
that would be a terrible world.

00:26:02.945 --> 00:26:07.465
But I really miss them a lot.

00:26:26.625 --> 00:26:28.145
It hasn't even been that long.

00:26:30.025 --> 00:26:31.825
Moss has already grown on these steps.

00:26:44.865 --> 00:26:46.225
Didn't you like to drink?

00:26:47.345 --> 00:26:48.985
I'll only give you a little.

00:26:50.225 --> 00:26:51.425
Are you angry?

00:26:53.825 --> 00:26:55.945
I dare you to snatch it from me.

00:26:57.465 --> 00:26:58.585
Come.

00:26:59.945 --> 00:27:01.305
Come and scold me.

00:27:12.945 --> 00:27:15.065
All of them dared not
mention you in front of me.

00:27:16.825 --> 00:27:17.945
It's nothing much.

00:27:19.665 --> 00:27:20.985
You are just dead.

00:27:23.225 --> 00:27:24.665
I dare to mention you.

00:27:25.865 --> 00:27:28.625
Old Man, you are dead!

00:27:28.705 --> 00:27:30.025
You are dead!

00:27:43.945 --> 00:27:45.305
Old Man,

00:27:48.305 --> 00:27:49.745
why must you act tough?

00:27:51.985 --> 00:27:53.145
Now,

00:27:55.105 --> 00:27:57.105
I'm the only one left in this world.

00:27:59.705 --> 00:28:00.825
How lonely.

00:28:20.265 --> 00:28:21.345
{\an8}Look.

00:28:22.065 --> 00:28:24.225
{\an8}Your legs shouldn't be wider
than your shoulders.

00:28:24.305 --> 00:28:25.305
{\an8}Close your feet.

00:28:26.905 --> 00:28:29.425
Yes. Steady.

00:28:31.585 --> 00:28:33.145
Not beyond your shoulders.

00:28:39.105 --> 00:28:40.225
This beef.

00:29:02.625 --> 00:29:04.505
Did you do this? I…

00:29:06.225 --> 00:29:07.065
Fine.

00:29:07.665 --> 00:29:08.785
Two more hours for you.

00:29:17.225 --> 00:29:18.785
Your lantern looks nice.

00:29:19.305 --> 00:29:20.145
I think so too.

00:29:20.225 --> 00:29:22.065
Your rabbit lantern also looks good.

00:29:22.145 --> 00:29:24.105
My mother taught me how
to make it when I was young.

00:29:25.625 --> 00:29:27.465
If you like it, let me teach you.

00:29:27.545 --> 00:29:28.705
Sure.

00:29:30.145 --> 00:29:31.585
This koi lantern is not bad either.

00:29:31.665 --> 00:29:32.505
Indeed.

00:29:32.585 --> 00:29:33.985
It's red and festive.

00:29:38.665 --> 00:29:39.505
Peiyi.

00:29:41.185 --> 00:29:42.225
Peiyi.

00:29:48.505 --> 00:29:49.545
Let's go home.

00:29:53.545 --> 00:29:54.545
Peiyi,

00:29:55.785 --> 00:29:56.945
you practiced well tonight.

00:29:57.025 --> 00:29:59.025
I'll give you a drumstick as a reward.

00:29:59.785 --> 00:30:00.625
Thank you.

00:30:04.865 --> 00:30:05.825
Is it delicious?

00:30:05.905 --> 00:30:07.585
- It is.
- Eat more.

00:30:08.465 --> 00:30:09.465
Master, you should eat, too.

00:30:09.545 --> 00:30:11.065
Sure. I'll eat.

00:30:11.145 --> 00:30:12.345
What a sensible child.

00:30:13.225 --> 00:30:15.065
Peiyi, let me ask you.

00:30:16.305 --> 00:30:18.145
What do you want to do when you grow up?

00:30:18.745 --> 00:30:20.185
I want to investigate cases.

00:30:20.985 --> 00:30:22.585
Here. Drink.

00:30:25.065 --> 00:30:27.905
When can I attend your wedding banquet?

00:30:27.985 --> 00:30:30.185
You should forget about it.

00:30:30.985 --> 00:30:32.705
You still won't leave?

00:30:32.785 --> 00:30:35.985
Little rascal. I'll beat you to death!

00:30:36.065 --> 00:30:37.625
Peiyi,

00:30:37.705 --> 00:30:40.785
we cannot let one thing
pause our whole life!

00:30:58.945 --> 00:31:00.265
Master.

00:31:04.025 --> 00:31:05.265
Little rascal,

00:31:05.345 --> 00:31:07.625
when was the last time
you called me Master?

00:31:08.385 --> 00:31:09.625
I can't even recall.

00:31:14.345 --> 00:31:15.265
Don't go.

00:31:16.345 --> 00:31:17.185
Don't go.

00:31:20.145 --> 00:31:22.025
Why am I not the one who died?

00:31:22.785 --> 00:31:26.225
Why did all of you abandon me?
I'm all alone again.

00:31:30.345 --> 00:31:33.625
The vast ocean feels like a dream,
while the constellations slowly drift.

00:31:33.705 --> 00:31:37.265
Everything will change.

00:31:38.385 --> 00:31:39.945
The rest of your journey is long.

00:31:40.465 --> 00:31:43.625
Your old man can no longer protect you.

00:31:44.305 --> 00:31:47.425
You can only go on alone.

00:31:50.945 --> 00:31:53.225
In governance and justice,

00:31:54.225 --> 00:31:55.665
even your family is not exempted.

00:31:56.265 --> 00:31:57.785
Don't forget

00:31:58.865 --> 00:32:00.225
what I taught you.

00:32:02.625 --> 00:32:04.065
I don't want to listen to you.

00:32:04.745 --> 00:32:05.865
If you leave,

00:32:06.905 --> 00:32:08.505
I will no longer listen to you.

00:32:12.105 --> 00:32:14.745
You can be willful tonight,

00:32:14.825 --> 00:32:17.945
but you shouldn't say this anymore.

00:32:19.385 --> 00:32:21.505
With great duty on your shoulders,

00:32:22.105 --> 00:32:24.585
you must do it.

00:32:28.105 --> 00:32:28.985
I know.

00:32:34.865 --> 00:32:37.545
If you face difficulties,

00:32:38.225 --> 00:32:39.825
just look up to the sky

00:32:40.585 --> 00:32:43.145
at the brightest star.

00:32:48.865 --> 00:32:53.705
Will you, Father, and Mother be there?

00:33:10.065 --> 00:33:11.265
Go to sleep.

00:33:12.625 --> 00:33:14.385
You'll feel better when you wake up.

00:33:59.065 --> 00:34:00.105
Deputy Director Xiao.

00:34:02.185 --> 00:34:04.305
I… Good evening.

00:34:08.105 --> 00:34:09.784
There are so many stars tonight.

00:34:26.744 --> 00:34:29.225
Your Ladyship, do you remember
you once asked me

00:34:29.744 --> 00:34:30.865
why I joined the Astronomical Bureau?

00:34:31.824 --> 00:34:34.465
Of course. Why?

00:34:35.824 --> 00:34:36.665
Because of you.

00:34:38.344 --> 00:34:39.185
Me?

00:34:40.784 --> 00:34:41.865
The Celestial Dog is eating the moon.

00:34:41.945 --> 00:34:43.385
Hurry, hide inside the house!

00:34:43.465 --> 00:34:45.264
- Hurry! Hurry.
- Everyone, hide quickly!

00:34:45.344 --> 00:34:46.505
- Hide quickly.
- Hurry.

00:34:46.585 --> 00:34:47.665
Be careful.

00:34:48.905 --> 00:34:50.784
Peiyi, stop watching.

00:34:50.865 --> 00:34:52.505
Otherwise, you'll be unlucky forever.

00:34:52.585 --> 00:34:55.225
Let's go. Stop watching.
Let's go. Let's go.

00:35:17.265 --> 00:35:18.865
Help!

00:35:18.945 --> 00:35:21.425
Little girl, can you help me?

00:35:26.305 --> 00:35:28.145
Why did you fall into the mud?

00:35:28.745 --> 00:35:31.025
I was looking at the moon.
I didn't watch my steps.

00:35:32.385 --> 00:35:34.505
And now, I took two steps

00:35:34.585 --> 00:35:35.945
and couldn't pull my feet out.

00:35:36.025 --> 00:35:38.265
I can't pull you out.

00:35:38.345 --> 00:35:39.545
I'm weak.

00:35:39.625 --> 00:35:42.145
If I pull you,
both of us will fall into the mud.

00:35:43.025 --> 00:35:44.665
You can't just force your way out, though.

00:35:44.745 --> 00:35:47.265
With your feet in the mud,
the harder you pull, the deeper you sink.

00:35:47.945 --> 00:35:48.985
What should I do, then?

00:35:49.065 --> 00:35:50.585
There are two ways.

00:35:50.665 --> 00:35:53.385
I can bring the adults here,
but you can't betray me.

00:35:53.465 --> 00:35:55.585
You can't tell them I snuck
out here to look at the moon.

00:35:55.665 --> 00:35:56.825
Alternatively, follow my instructions.

00:35:56.905 --> 00:35:59.705
I can help you, but you have to be brave.

00:36:04.345 --> 00:36:05.945
Sure. I'm very brave.

00:36:06.025 --> 00:36:08.865
Hold tight and don't let go.
Lie flat on the mud.

00:36:08.945 --> 00:36:11.065
The flatter, the better.

00:36:13.305 --> 00:36:14.145
And then?

00:36:14.225 --> 00:36:15.185
Just wait.

00:36:20.425 --> 00:36:22.825
I'm not sinking anymore. You're amazing.

00:36:22.905 --> 00:36:25.905
It's a method my father taught me.
Of course, it's amazing.

00:36:26.505 --> 00:36:28.385
Now, slowly pull your leg out.

00:36:52.945 --> 00:36:55.425
I am the Crown Prince's Grand Tutor,
Xiao Wenyuan's son, Xiao Huaijin.

00:36:55.505 --> 00:36:57.745
- Thank you.
- Look.

00:37:24.225 --> 00:37:25.145
Thank you.

00:37:26.825 --> 00:37:28.385
Who did you say you were?

00:37:29.905 --> 00:37:32.305
The Crown Prince's Grand Tutor,
Xiao Wenyuan's son, Xiao Huaijin.

00:37:32.385 --> 00:37:33.905
I came here with my parents.

00:37:39.505 --> 00:37:42.385
Do you have something on your mind?

00:37:42.465 --> 00:37:43.305
I can help you.

00:37:43.905 --> 00:37:47.065
Didn't they say it was bad luck
when the Celestial Dog ate the moon?

00:37:47.145 --> 00:37:48.345
Why didn't I see that?

00:37:53.585 --> 00:37:56.625
Other people were scared
and hid from the moon,

00:37:56.705 --> 00:37:58.865
but you snuck out because of this?

00:37:58.945 --> 00:38:00.705
Did you not do the same because of this?

00:38:03.385 --> 00:38:04.305
Yes.

00:38:05.505 --> 00:38:08.305
However,
I didn't do it because of the omen.

00:38:08.385 --> 00:38:10.945
I like to observe the changes
of the moon and the stars.

00:38:12.465 --> 00:38:14.345
Do you know many stars?

00:38:16.425 --> 00:38:17.905
I know more than 100 stars.

00:38:17.985 --> 00:38:19.425
The Orion Constellation.

00:38:19.505 --> 00:38:20.625
The Big Dipper.

00:38:20.705 --> 00:38:21.585
The Gemini.

00:38:21.665 --> 00:38:23.225
The Dubhe.

00:38:23.305 --> 00:38:25.105
The Merak And…

00:38:25.185 --> 00:38:26.905
Do you know about Mars staying at Antares?

00:38:27.665 --> 00:38:29.625
It means Mars
is entering the Heart Mansion.

00:38:29.705 --> 00:38:33.425
Why do Father and Mother
look worried when they mention this?

00:38:34.785 --> 00:38:37.625
Some astrological signs
can predict what happens in the world.

00:38:37.705 --> 00:38:41.505
Do you know what Mars
staying at Antares means?

00:38:46.425 --> 00:38:47.425
I don't know.

00:38:48.305 --> 00:38:50.705
Why do the changes in the stars

00:38:50.785 --> 00:38:52.865
make the people on land so afraid?

00:38:52.945 --> 00:38:55.225
How does it bring bad luck to the people

00:38:55.305 --> 00:38:57.545
when the moon is devoured and spat out?

00:39:01.345 --> 00:39:03.625
I've never thought about these issues.

00:39:06.985 --> 00:39:08.185
What is your name?

00:39:08.265 --> 00:39:10.745
My name is Peiyi. Li Peiyi.

00:39:10.825 --> 00:39:12.705
Are you the Prince of Duan's daughter?

00:39:15.665 --> 00:39:19.065
Is Mars staying at Antares
so important to you?

00:39:23.305 --> 00:39:25.905
I'll help you check it.
When I find out why, I'll tell you.

00:39:32.745 --> 00:39:36.265
The moon is coming out soon.
If I don't go back, I'll be caught.

00:39:53.865 --> 00:39:56.505
You joined the Astronomical Bureau
because of that?

00:39:58.865 --> 00:40:00.785
After I returned home, I asked Mother.

00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:01.705
Mother said

00:40:01.785 --> 00:40:04.665
I could only learn astronomy
after joining the Astronomical Bureau.

00:40:04.745 --> 00:40:06.705
Normal people cannot simply talk about it.

00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:09.465
But after you join
the Astronomical Bureau,

00:40:09.545 --> 00:40:11.985
you can only meet your family once a year
during the Lantern Festival break.

00:40:13.745 --> 00:40:15.065
Back then, I didn't think about all this.

00:40:15.785 --> 00:40:19.385
I thought I could answer
your question quickly.

00:40:19.905 --> 00:40:21.905
But after I joined
the Astronomical Bureau,

00:40:21.985 --> 00:40:23.905
I realized I had many things to learn.

00:40:24.825 --> 00:40:27.665
It takes many years to learn astrology.

00:40:28.545 --> 00:40:30.305
However, that was no trouble for me.

00:40:32.665 --> 00:40:33.985
The Lantern Festival

00:40:34.065 --> 00:40:35.705
is when the officials and students
of the Astronomical Bureau

00:40:35.785 --> 00:40:37.745
can reunite with their families.

00:40:38.265 --> 00:40:40.025
There were only a few people

00:40:40.105 --> 00:40:41.345
in the Astronomical Bureau
during that period.

00:40:52.425 --> 00:40:54.065
{\an8}WHEN MARS TRESPASSES UPON THE HEART
MANSION, VICTORY IN WAR IS IMPOSSIBLE

00:40:54.145 --> 00:40:55.865
{\an8}GENERALS WILL EITHER BE SLAIN ABROAD
OR THE RULER WILL DIE

00:41:43.945 --> 00:41:45.545
- Oh no!
- Please don't!

00:41:45.625 --> 00:41:47.225
- Help!
- Don't do it!

00:41:51.865 --> 00:41:52.905
Help!

00:42:06.105 --> 00:42:06.945
I found

00:42:08.505 --> 00:42:10.345
the meaning of Mars staying at Antares.

00:42:11.265 --> 00:42:14.785
I also found out
why your parents were worried.

00:42:16.625 --> 00:42:18.265
When Mars trespasses
upon the Heart Mansion,

00:42:19.185 --> 00:42:20.265
victory in war is impossible.

00:42:21.945 --> 00:42:25.385
When Mars lingers in the Heart Mansion,
those in power will be overthrown.

00:42:26.025 --> 00:42:27.425
The ruler will be chased from his palace.

00:42:28.425 --> 00:42:29.825
Fifteen years ago,

00:42:30.545 --> 00:42:33.145
someone used this astrological sign
to take a dig at my father.

00:42:37.705 --> 00:42:38.665
You are too foolish.

00:42:39.785 --> 00:42:43.785
My question cost you
15 years of your life,

00:42:45.425 --> 00:42:47.225
but I don't even remember anything.

00:42:49.905 --> 00:42:52.265
Do you regret it?

00:42:56.425 --> 00:42:59.105
I will never regret any choices I make.

00:42:59.625 --> 00:43:00.785
Besides,

00:43:03.425 --> 00:43:06.105
I really want to answer
every single one of your questions.

00:43:12.905 --> 00:43:15.305
It's getting late. I need to go back.

00:43:17.425 --> 00:43:18.425
Peiyi.

00:43:19.905 --> 00:43:20.825
Today is your birthday.

00:43:22.345 --> 00:43:23.665
I never celebrate my birthday.

00:43:23.745 --> 00:43:24.945
I know.

00:43:28.825 --> 00:43:30.105
On this day every year,

00:43:30.985 --> 00:43:33.105
I hate myself a lot.

00:43:35.065 --> 00:43:37.145
Why am I the only one who survived?

00:43:38.345 --> 00:43:40.705
Now, the old man
even died because of this.

00:43:41.345 --> 00:43:43.985
I'm still the only survivor.

00:43:45.705 --> 00:43:47.305
You are alive

00:43:47.985 --> 00:43:51.265
because you are the only one
who can seek justice for them

00:43:51.865 --> 00:43:52.985
and vindicate them.

00:43:53.865 --> 00:43:54.945
Also…

00:43:55.545 --> 00:43:57.025
you are not alone.

00:43:58.145 --> 00:43:59.745
This is not over yet.

00:44:00.345 --> 00:44:03.105
They will find me,
or even you, sooner or later.

00:44:03.185 --> 00:44:04.265
I don't want…

00:44:10.665 --> 00:44:13.705
I don't want the people around me
to be involved in this because of me.

00:44:15.345 --> 00:44:16.345
Peiyi,

00:44:18.105 --> 00:44:19.905
you just need to know my intention.

00:44:19.985 --> 00:44:21.985
But don't see it as a burden.

00:44:23.865 --> 00:44:24.785
As for me,

00:44:25.625 --> 00:44:28.865
I will not regret the choices I made.
