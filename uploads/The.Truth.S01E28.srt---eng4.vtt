=The Truth=

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.136
=Episode 28=

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.240
(The individuals involved
in these three incidents are unrelated.)

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.920
(The only common factor
was this fingerprint.)

00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:20.601
(It's currently unclear
what this means.)

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:22.881
(But given Liu Xiaofeng's fall,)

00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:24.561
(we have reason to believe)

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.001
(that the fingerprints
were not accidental.)

00:03:04.632 --> 00:03:10.256
(Yu Xiao'ou just died. Why Xia Tian,
her "best friend", starts a new life?)

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.561
On November 24th last year,

00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:46.041
someone from Dragonview Manor
called the police,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.800
claiming there was a gas leak

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.281
with an imminent risk of explosion.

00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:50.960
After receiving the call,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.041
the police responded
with property, gas, and fire personnel.

00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:57.321
During the evacuation of residents,

00:03:57.321 --> 00:04:01.561
Cheng Jianmin of Building 9, Unit 1102,
was found dead.

00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:06.640
Cheng Jianmin, male, 70 years old,

00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:09.760
lived at Unit 1102, Building 9,
Dragonview Manor.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.520
(Cheng Jianmin's living room)
He lived alone.

00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:13.841
Property management and police

00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:15.080
went door to door at the scene.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.841
They received no response
from this unit.

00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:20.560
They forced entry and found
Cheng Jianmin collapsed on the sofa.

00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:24.440
Property staff and police officers
administered first aid on the spot,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.601
but couldn't save him.

00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:27.880
Later, the emergency was declared.

00:04:28.281 --> 00:04:29.961
The gas leak was a false alarm.

00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:32.201
Medical personnel arrived then,

00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:35.961
and determined Cheng Jianmin had died
before the property staff forced entry.

00:04:35.961 --> 00:04:37.961
The cause of death was likely
a heart attack.

00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:42.721
Here are pictures of some medications
Cheng Jianmin used daily.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.041
Given that Cheng Jianmin
was on long-term medication

00:04:46.401 --> 00:04:48.641
and was an ill heart patient
with limited mobility,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.000
the incident was ruled
as a sudden illness.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.240
His children also raised no objections.

00:04:56.761 --> 00:04:59.161
What's the situation
with Cheng Jianmin's children?

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.841
I looked into it.

00:05:00.841 --> 00:05:03.641
Cheng Jianmin's wife
passed away many years ago.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.480
Cheng Jianmin never remarried.

00:05:05.841 --> 00:05:07.641
They had two sons and one daughter.

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:08.761
They had their own families.

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:10.560
The daughter lives abroad.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.800
The two sons live here.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.992
Cheng Jianmin collapsed
so close to these medications.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.281
(Cheng Jianmin's death scene)
Didn't he get to use them?

00:05:17.721 --> 00:05:19.961
I suspect the attack was too sudden.

00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:21.201
He didn't have time.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.641
Viewed this way, it seems like
a common occurrence.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.281
Were there any other anomalies
at the scene?

00:05:28.521 --> 00:05:31.281
No signs of a struggle or fight
were found at the scene.

00:05:31.281 --> 00:05:32.560
No loss of property, either.

00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:37.761
This is an emergency alert device, right?
Connected to the community office.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.920
Also very close to him.

00:05:40.761 --> 00:05:41.360
Never used?

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.000
Probably not.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.480
Regarding the follow-up,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.601
a social worker did raise an objection.

00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:49.680
First, she didn't receive
a distress call from Cheng Jianmin.

00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:52.841
Second, the heater would cause him
chest tightness and shortness of breath.

00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:53.641
So he never used it.

00:05:53.641 --> 00:05:56.281
Yet, the heater was on that day.

00:05:56.841 --> 00:06:00.281
This social worker mainly took care
of seniors living alone.

00:06:00.281 --> 00:06:02.201
She was quite familiar
with Cheng Jianmin.

00:06:02.201 --> 00:06:04.161
It was due to her persistence

00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:07.680
that our colleagues conducted
a brief search of Cheng Jianmin's home.

00:06:08.281 --> 00:06:10.081
But nothing suspicious was found.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.761
Where was that fingerprint found?

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.761
On the AC remote control.

00:06:15.521 --> 00:06:18.480
However, Cheng Jianmin employed
an hourly cleaner,

00:06:18.641 --> 00:06:20.081
who came every week to clean.

00:06:20.081 --> 00:06:22.041
Finding outsider's fingerprints
is quite normal.

00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:23.281
No anomalies after all.

00:06:23.281 --> 00:06:24.761
So the matter wasn't pursued further.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.521
But later, same fingerprints were found
in connection with three separate cases,

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.841
prompting attention
from the investigating units.

00:06:30.841 --> 00:06:32.120
The investigation was reopened.

00:06:48.521 --> 00:06:49.201
Hello.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.360
Have a seat.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.680
This incident happened
quite a while ago.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.961
Why are you still investigating?

00:06:54.721 --> 00:06:56.560
Wasn't it concluded
that there were no issues?

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.841
We heard you were quite familiar
with Cheng Jianmin's situation.

00:07:00.161 --> 00:07:01.360
We're here today

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.440
to ask you to walk us through about it.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.201
No trouble at all.

00:07:05.401 --> 00:07:07.120
I should cooperate with the police.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.201
It's just that it's been a long time.

00:07:10.201 --> 00:07:12.320
I'm afraid I might not remember
many details clearly.

00:07:12.961 --> 00:07:15.480
I remember when I arrived that day,

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.800
the ambulance was already there.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.120
It was very chaotic at the time.

00:07:20.041 --> 00:07:23.761
What was Cheng Jianmin's relationship
with his children like?

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.920
Well, you've hit the nail on the head.

00:07:26.641 --> 00:07:27.961
Those children of Cheng...

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.161
His daughter got her green card early
and settled abroad.

00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:36.521
The two sons are here locally,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.721
and they are quite rich.

00:07:39.601 --> 00:07:41.021
But none of them

00:07:41.021 --> 00:07:44.201
want to live with and take care
of their old man.

00:07:45.281 --> 00:07:46.000
Cheng was also

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.440
a bit impatient,

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.201
with a temper.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.240
What conflicts did they have?

00:07:53.521 --> 00:07:54.521
Cheng

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.161
used to be in real estate development.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.880
His company wasn't as big
as those major enterprises,

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.201
but it was still substantial.

00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:03.320
Now, he's handing it over
to the next generation.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.641
How much should each get?

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.240
Why give to one but not the other?

00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:09.161
I heard his two sons

00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:12.201
even fought a lawsuit
over inheriting the business.

00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:15.240
Well, I just remembered something.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.081
On the day Cheng died,

00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:20.641
the elder son, younger son,

00:08:20.641 --> 00:08:24.000
and their wives got
into a big argument right downstairs.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.920
It even went physical.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.641
How did it get physical?

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:29.081
What?

00:08:29.081 --> 00:08:29.880
Stop arguing!

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.720
What's your problem?

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.121
What are you arguing about?

00:08:35.641 --> 00:08:36.361
Stop it!

00:08:36.361 --> 00:08:37.320
Dad, stay out of this.

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:39.600
Still arguing with the old man here?

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.720
- Stop it!
- Let go!

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.401
Listen up.

00:08:41.401 --> 00:08:41.920
Let go!

00:08:42.401 --> 00:08:43.320
Stop this!

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.320
Let go!

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.200
Calm down first.

00:08:45.481 --> 00:08:46.241
Stay calm.

00:08:46.241 --> 00:08:47.401
- Talk it out!
- Calm down!

00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:48.481
You're family! Why fight?

00:08:48.481 --> 00:08:49.320
All because of you!

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.080
After the old man got inside,

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.960
they were too embarrassed
to keep arguing.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.521
The old man's health was usually poor,

00:08:55.881 --> 00:08:58.361
but he seemed fine that day.

00:08:58.761 --> 00:09:01.121
Were his children satisfied
with how it was handled?

00:09:01.121 --> 00:09:03.001
They all thought I was overstepping,

00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:05.600
pressuring me to issue
the death certificate quickly.

00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:07.401
They wanted to sell the house fast.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.761
Did they sell it?

00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:10.001
Of course, not.

00:09:10.121 --> 00:09:11.960
Cheng has a daughter overseas, right?

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.320
She refused to come back

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.720
and wouldn't cooperate with them
on the notarization.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.600
She was just dragging it out.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.001
Do you know about Cheng Jianmin's
social connections?

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.521
I don't know much about that.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.320
Had he used the emergency alert device

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.521
in his room before?

00:09:29.241 --> 00:09:30.121
Yes.

00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:31.720
Multiple times, actually.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.840
But it was usually false alarms.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.800
He took it very seriously.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.680
If anything seemed slightly off,

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.761
he'd call us immediately.

00:09:40.761 --> 00:09:43.560
That's why I found it strange this time.

00:09:43.641 --> 00:09:45.641
Why didn't he call us?

00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:50.200
Let's discuss the heating issue.

00:09:51.401 --> 00:09:52.361
Oh, that...

00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:56.041
When I rushed over that day,

00:09:56.641 --> 00:09:58.440
I noticed his room was extremely hot.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.560
The temperature was high.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.920
All heaters were on.

00:10:01.121 --> 00:10:04.241
Our community uses
centralized electric heating.

00:10:04.241 --> 00:10:05.041
Electric-powered.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.361
Cheng usually avoided heating
because it made him feel suffocated.

00:10:08.361 --> 00:10:10.241
Neighbors above and below complained.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.641
His refusal affected
their temperatures too.

00:10:12.761 --> 00:10:14.761
They even confronted him
at home over it.

00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:15.761
Caused some friction.

00:10:17.001 --> 00:10:18.560
Later, my supervisor told me,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.720
"Maybe Cheng just felt cold suddenly."

00:10:22.241 --> 00:10:24.121
I realized my supervisor had a point.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.161
I overreacted.

00:10:30.401 --> 00:10:31.761
Alright, Ms. Zhao.

00:10:32.001 --> 00:10:33.800
That's all for today.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.041
Thank you.

00:10:35.041 --> 00:10:35.840
You're welcome.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.001
Happy to assist.

00:10:37.001 --> 00:10:37.521
Okay.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:38.881
Thanks.

00:10:38.881 --> 00:10:39.761
- Okay.
- Thanks.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.041
Hello?

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.200
If Cheng Jianmin's family comes,
question them first.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.481
Send me the phone number and address.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.560
Got it.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:57.600
We found the person
who reported the gas leak last time.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.680
We need to go there now.

00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:02.241
Master, do you think
that caller is suspicious?

00:11:02.761 --> 00:11:03.401
Hard to tell.

00:11:05.481 --> 00:11:08.001
You haven't taken leave
in a while, right?

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.521
Visit your parents when you can.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.121
Appreciate your concern.

00:11:14.121 --> 00:11:16.560
Still swamped with cases.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.281
I'll go later.

00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:17.761
Alright.

00:11:38.121 --> 00:11:39.440
These two are unbelievable.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.521
Fighting anywhere, anytime.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.041
Is it really worth it?

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.521
Is it worth it?

00:11:45.481 --> 00:11:46.481
I'm telling you.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.920
This is not a small amount.

00:11:48.121 --> 00:11:50.001
That Dragonview Manor apartment,

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:52.121
I bet you couldn't afford it
in your lifetime.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.761
But judging from motives,

00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:56.401
they are not suspicious.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.680
There's no will.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.920
He passes away like this,
and it gets even messier.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.960
Do you think this is actually a case?

00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:06.080
So far, nothing seems off.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.881
Just an unidentified fingerprint.

00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:09.641
Keep investigating.

00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:11.521
Cheng Jianmin is in real estate,

00:12:11.521 --> 00:12:13.001
with complicated social connections.

00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:15.600
We might actually dig something up.

00:12:16.161 --> 00:12:16.840
Okay.

00:12:17.208 --> 00:12:18.552
(Mobile Parcel Service Truck)

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.401
Cheng Xiaowei, right?

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.720
City CID.

00:12:34.881 --> 00:12:35.761
CID officers?

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:36.920
Looking for me?

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.361
Is this your phone number?

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.481
Yes, it's mine.

00:12:44.641 --> 00:12:46.440
It's a company-issued work phone.

00:12:46.881 --> 00:12:48.600
On November 24th last year,

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:50.241
you used this number

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.560
to report a gas leak
at Dragonview Manor. Remember?

00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:55.840
Last year...

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.641
Yes.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.641
There was a gas leak incident there.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.361
But I wasn't the one who called it in.

00:13:02.361 --> 00:13:04.960
The log shows it came from your number.

00:13:06.121 --> 00:13:07.200
The number is mine,

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.320
but I didn't make that call.

00:13:09.241 --> 00:13:11.161
Someone borrowed my phone that day.

00:13:11.161 --> 00:13:12.920
Said there was a gas leak at home.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.761
Forgot to bring a phone when left home.

00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:18.121
Remember anything about that person?

00:13:21.241 --> 00:13:22.200
That person...

00:13:24.281 --> 00:13:25.241
Can't recall clearly.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.600
It was a woman.

00:13:28.521 --> 00:13:29.800
Pretty average-looking.

00:13:33.361 --> 00:13:34.241
This one?

00:13:35.361 --> 00:13:36.440
Body shape matches.

00:13:36.881 --> 00:13:37.960
But I can't be sure.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.001
We deal with tons
of people daily in this job.

00:13:41.361 --> 00:13:43.320
What did she do after calling?

00:13:43.881 --> 00:13:46.560
She handed my phone back
after reporting.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.600
Then left.

00:13:49.001 --> 00:13:50.361
No idea where she went.

00:13:52.161 --> 00:13:52.960
Take your time.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.920
Think about it.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.121
See what else comes to mind.

00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:01.881
There's something.

00:14:02.161 --> 00:14:04.161
But I'm not sure if it's related.

00:14:04.641 --> 00:14:07.080
Cops and firefighters showed up fast.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.361
And the place got chaotic.

00:14:10.161 --> 00:14:11.440
Someone swiped my vest.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.200
Vest?

00:14:13.161 --> 00:14:14.001
What kind of vest?

00:14:16.401 --> 00:14:17.200
Like this one.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.840
Company-issued.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.121
Mandatory uniform for work.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.080
Cheap material.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.521
Can't imagine why anyone'd steal it.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:27.481
Thanks.

00:14:37.641 --> 00:14:38.440
Off work?

00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:40.121
That's early.

00:14:40.281 --> 00:14:42.001
Early? It's already dark.

00:14:43.241 --> 00:14:44.121
Got a date?

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.881
Class reunion.

00:14:46.041 --> 00:14:47.200
Do I look okay?

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:47.840
Looks good.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.041
Well...

00:14:49.041 --> 00:14:51.320
Oh, right. I was just
about to bring this to you.

00:14:51.521 --> 00:14:52.521
Results are in.

00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:54.361
The fiber samples you collected

00:14:54.361 --> 00:14:57.161
and fibers
from Liu Xiaofeng's fall scene

00:14:58.121 --> 00:15:01.521
are identical in color,
material, and hardness.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.920
It means the fiber at the fall scene

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.440
came from a courier's vest?

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.720
Can't say for sure.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.641
Because other companies
use this fabric too.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.600
But it's a useful reference.

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:17.521
If you locate that vest,

00:15:17.521 --> 00:15:19.001
I can run a comparison.

00:15:20.401 --> 00:15:21.521
It's late. I'll head out.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.560
Stay safe.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.600
Bye.

00:15:28.361 --> 00:15:29.361
I made some inquiries.

00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.440
Regarding Cheng Jianmin's
small real estate firm,

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.361
despite the power struggle
between his sons,

00:15:33.481 --> 00:15:35.320
the operations are solid overall.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.960
Employee benefits are decent.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.481
Staff speak well of him too.

00:15:40.361 --> 00:15:42.440
Real estate breeds disputes

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.121
and makes enemies easily.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.401
But when Cheng Jianmin ran things,

00:15:48.401 --> 00:15:49.641
he was well-liked.

00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:53.161
Never heard of him having any grudges
or disputes with anyone.

00:15:53.761 --> 00:15:54.641
By the way, Qian,

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.521
how's the caller's investigation?

00:15:58.121 --> 00:16:00.121
We can basically confirm
it was a false report.

00:16:01.121 --> 00:16:05.200
I suspect the goal was to get
Cheng Jianmin's body found quickly.

00:16:06.361 --> 00:16:07.320
That doesn't make sense.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.560
Logically, wouldn't they
want it found as late as possible?

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.001
Exactly.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:18.001
Let's assume that call is connected
to Cheng Jianmin's death.

00:16:18.161 --> 00:16:20.920
And Cheng Jianmin's death
wasn't a real accident.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.521
So, the later it's found,

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.320
the more likely it would be mistaken
as a natural death, right?

00:16:27.241 --> 00:16:29.281
What killer would want to be discovered?

00:16:29.281 --> 00:16:30.001
Alright.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.401
It's late.

00:16:31.401 --> 00:16:31.920
Captain Leng.

00:16:32.521 --> 00:16:33.041
Master.

00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:34.641
You should head home and get some rest.

00:16:35.041 --> 00:16:37.761
Tomorrow, you and Long go back
to the homestay scene.

00:16:39.001 --> 00:16:40.440
We're dropping Cheng Jianmin's case?

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.001
No. But we can't put all our eggs
in one basket.

00:16:43.241 --> 00:16:46.241
Assign a few people to keep digging
into Cheng Jianmin's social connections.

00:16:46.241 --> 00:16:47.080
Yes.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.920
The rest of you,
get ready for the next case.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.560
Dismissed. Get some rest, now.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.521
Yes, sir.

00:16:52.521 --> 00:16:54.161
Come. Need to talk to you
about something.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.512
(Martyr Chen Yumo's Tomb)

00:17:18.761 --> 00:17:20.320
See the painting I made for you?

00:17:22.001 --> 00:17:24.681
It's in your favorite Rembrandt style.

00:17:25.761 --> 00:17:26.921
I'd never tried it before.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.921
This time, I realized it's really hard.

00:17:31.761 --> 00:17:33.441
You'll probably laugh at how bad it is.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.160
But that's okay.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.160
I've picked up the brush again now.

00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:41.041
If it's not good,

00:17:41.521 --> 00:17:42.600
I can just keep practicing.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.521
You're late.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.721
Found anything?

00:18:34.201 --> 00:18:36.400
Nothing significant.

00:18:36.521 --> 00:18:39.201
This homestay
is in the middle of nowhere.

00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:41.360
I just did a rough estimate

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.400
of the area this camera can cover.

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.001
Police?

00:18:50.441 --> 00:18:51.721
I've been waiting for you.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.041
Your homestay is out of the way.

00:19:01.921 --> 00:19:02.521
Yes.

00:19:05.281 --> 00:19:06.241
I'll take you to see it.

00:19:06.721 --> 00:19:07.840
The scenery here is great.

00:19:08.241 --> 00:19:10.160
Lots of city folks come here for it.

00:19:12.761 --> 00:19:13.600
It's right up ahead.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.840
This path isn't easy to walk.

00:19:18.961 --> 00:19:20.201
You'll get used to it.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.120
Has anything been moved?

00:19:25.521 --> 00:19:26.201
No.

00:19:26.201 --> 00:19:27.921
It costs money
to have someone move things.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.921
Besides, who'd want to do that?

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:34.721
You know what?

00:19:34.721 --> 00:19:36.360
I'm cursed with the worst luck

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.761
to get such a guest.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.481
My homestay just opened a few days ago,

00:19:40.481 --> 00:19:41.600
and now this happens!

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.400
Someone died in this room!

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.961
Who will be willing to stay here now?

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.041
How much do you know
about the deceased, Zhou Lianqin?

00:19:49.041 --> 00:19:50.281
I didn't know him.

00:19:50.441 --> 00:19:51.681
He just gave a phone number.

00:19:51.681 --> 00:19:53.921
The name on the reservation
wasn't even his.

00:19:54.201 --> 00:19:55.001
Who booked it?

00:19:55.681 --> 00:19:57.640
I figure his family booked it for him.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.840
They placed the order online.

00:19:58.961 --> 00:20:00.201
Paid for it online.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.560
Then he just came
to get the key and stay.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.521
If I'd known he was
a pyramid scheme runner on the lam,

00:20:05.521 --> 00:20:06.961
a deadbeat shown on TV,

00:20:07.241 --> 00:20:09.320
I'd never in a million years
have rented to him!

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.360
Alive, he cheated and scammed people,

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.800
and dead, he couldn't even find
some deserted spot

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.201
and had to come here to haunt me?

00:20:19.481 --> 00:20:20.921
Has anyone touched this up here?

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.521
No.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.800
Describe the situation back then.

00:20:26.281 --> 00:20:28.001
I wasn't there when it happened.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.600
His family couldn't reach him,

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.921
so they called me and rushed over.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.281
Was Zhou Lianqin alone in the room
those few days?

00:20:35.281 --> 00:20:36.320
I don't know.

00:20:36.961 --> 00:20:38.521
He booked the place for a week.

00:20:38.961 --> 00:20:41.281
Said he preferred not to be disturbed.

00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:43.241
No need for housekeeping to clean often.

00:20:43.761 --> 00:20:45.640
He paid upfront willingly.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.600
No haggling.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.800
It was the off-season,
so I rented it to him.

00:20:49.001 --> 00:20:49.800
When I got here,

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.921
the door was locked from the inside.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.120
A window was open a crack,
so I climbed in.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.288
I came in, went over here,

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.560
and he was hanging right here.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.880
So scary.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.320
You got him down?

00:21:00.481 --> 00:21:01.721
How would I dare do that?

00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:03.360
I called an ambulance.

00:21:04.201 --> 00:21:05.521
His family took him down.

00:21:05.521 --> 00:21:06.640
After the ambulance arrived,

00:21:06.961 --> 00:21:09.761
they said he'd been dead
for several hours.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.921
I just didn't expect

00:21:11.921 --> 00:21:14.281
a hanged person would be like this.

00:21:14.281 --> 00:21:15.560
Made everything all messy.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.201
Alright, do whatever you want.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.320
I'm leaving.
Call me if you need anything.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.120
Oh, my.

00:21:29.041 --> 00:21:30.120
Found anything?

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.441
There are obvious friction marks
on the beam.

00:21:36.001 --> 00:21:37.681
My theory is

00:21:39.001 --> 00:21:42.481
that during self-hanging,
the body instinctively sways.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.681
Thus, the rope rubs against the beam,
leaving marks.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.001
This is key to determining
if he was alive when hanged.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.400
Because the deceased was heavy,

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.481
the friction marks are deeper.

00:21:56.041 --> 00:21:57.840
At first glance, it seems fine,

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.160
but closer inspection reveals

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.721
traces of rope fibers
at the base of the marks.

00:22:03.721 --> 00:22:05.640
And the fibers are aligned uniformly.

00:22:06.721 --> 00:22:10.320
But instinctive body movements
cause irregular friction.

00:22:10.681 --> 00:22:13.600
Only consistent,
forward pulling of the rope

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.201
would produce this pattern.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.880
No wonder the investigating unit
labeled it suspected suicide.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.041
Homicide can't be ruled out.

00:22:20.961 --> 00:22:23.160
The victim was hung up by someone else.

00:22:23.481 --> 00:22:25.400
The family insisted on an autopsy then.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.961
The death report listed cerebral edema
from carotid occlusion.

00:22:33.201 --> 00:22:37.400
The neck ligature marks
are also consistent with hanging.

00:22:38.961 --> 00:22:40.761
If my hypothesis is correct,

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.001
I suspect the victim was semi-conscious

00:22:46.001 --> 00:22:47.961
when the noose was placed
and he was hoisted.

00:22:48.201 --> 00:22:49.681
But to pull this off,

00:22:49.681 --> 00:22:52.001
the killer must weigh
at least as much as the victim.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.600
Zhou Lianqin weighed nearly 100kg.

00:22:58.281 --> 00:22:59.961
A killer heavier than him...

00:23:01.921 --> 00:23:03.001
There's another possibility

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.320
that he used a pulley or similar tool.

00:23:28.961 --> 00:23:30.441
Where was that fingerprint found?

00:23:32.481 --> 00:23:33.800
Next to the ligature mark.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.481
This is the only person who entered

00:23:57.521 --> 00:23:59.201
after Zhou checked in,
before the incident.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.201
And he wasn't seen leaving.

00:24:01.681 --> 00:24:05.001
He likely left
through the back window, as you said.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.840
Can you zoom in more?

00:24:07.961 --> 00:24:09.201
I can,

00:24:09.481 --> 00:24:11.360
but see how covered up he is?

00:24:12.241 --> 00:24:15.800
I compared this with Gao Liang's photo.

00:24:16.201 --> 00:24:17.001
Look.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.041
Here, sunglasses hide the eyes.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.441
Here, only the eyes are visible.

00:24:23.241 --> 00:24:26.400
Data-wise, I can't confirm
it's the same person.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.241
But physically, they share similarities.

00:24:31.241 --> 00:24:32.560
Strong similarities, actually.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.241
Both over 180 cm tall,

00:24:34.241 --> 00:24:35.241
lean build.

00:24:44.521 --> 00:24:45.160
Captain Leng.

00:24:46.041 --> 00:24:47.160
This is Wen Yong's wife.

00:24:47.521 --> 00:24:49.560
This is Captain Leng
from our city police CID.

00:24:50.481 --> 00:24:51.281
Please have a seat.

00:24:57.681 --> 00:24:58.640
We called you in today

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.560
to learn more about Wen Yong.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.400
Is there anything you can tell us?

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.160
I've told you people many times.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.400
My husband would never
solicit prostitutes.

00:25:07.961 --> 00:25:10.080
He disappeared on a business trip.

00:25:10.201 --> 00:25:11.600
It's been almost two months.

00:25:12.481 --> 00:25:13.800
Relevant departments

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.201
have investigated
Wen Yong's disappearance repeatedly.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.840
But truly, no further leads exist.

00:25:19.481 --> 00:25:21.681
However, current evidence supports

00:25:21.681 --> 00:25:25.080
that your husband solicited prostitutes
before his disappearance.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.761
Here are his call logs
from the past six months.

00:25:38.041 --> 00:25:39.041
Take a look.

00:25:40.721 --> 00:25:42.961
See this number highlighted in red?

00:25:44.041 --> 00:25:47.400
It's a known number
for an illegal massage parlor.

00:25:48.041 --> 00:25:49.921
Judging by the call frequency,

00:25:50.241 --> 00:25:52.041
your husband was a regular.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:54.880
Impossible.

00:25:55.961 --> 00:25:57.481
You just can't find him,

00:25:57.481 --> 00:25:59.360
so you're smearing my husband.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.600
Then please tell us more about Wen Yong.

00:26:07.001 --> 00:26:08.640
Why did he leave home that day?

00:26:09.281 --> 00:26:10.080
Business trip.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.800
Official work for his company.

00:26:11.961 --> 00:26:13.681
Taking a train to a meeting out of town.

00:26:14.201 --> 00:26:16.241
Do you know what time
his train ticket was for?

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.241
6:00 PM.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.201
How did he usually reach the station?

00:26:19.201 --> 00:26:20.160
By taxi.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.360
Please take a look.
Is this your husband Wen Yong?

00:26:33.441 --> 00:26:37.041
These are screenshots from cameras
along his route that day.

00:26:37.681 --> 00:26:39.241
Footage shows

00:26:39.521 --> 00:26:42.640
your husband left home and took a taxi
directly to this massage parlor.

00:26:45.201 --> 00:26:46.521
Timeline-wise,

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.840
he stayed inside for about 90 minutes.

00:26:51.281 --> 00:26:52.880
After that, he vanished without a trace.

00:26:59.281 --> 00:27:00.360
My husband...

00:27:02.761 --> 00:27:06.360
Our family has always been harmonious.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.201
We both have stable jobs.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.441
A good relationship, too.

00:27:12.041 --> 00:27:16.001
We've never had an argument
in all these years.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.360
How did you get that scar?

00:27:27.441 --> 00:27:28.441
I fell once.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.320
Did Wen Yong have
anything valuable on him?

00:27:34.481 --> 00:27:36.001
He had several cards in his wallet.

00:27:36.441 --> 00:27:37.600
And a watch.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.320
But it wasn't a high-end brand.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.521
Worth around 10,000 yuan.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.721
Have some.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.800
This is the last place
Wen Yong was seen.

00:27:57.921 --> 00:27:59.160
This is the massage parlor.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.560
Less than 50 meters this way
is the main road.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.640
The masseuse who attended to Wen Yong
was named Jiang Xiaohua.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.120
According to her testimony,

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.400
Wen Yong was a regular of hers.

00:28:08.521 --> 00:28:10.201
That's where the fingerprints
were found.

00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:12.921
They were discovered
because there was blood nearby.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.600
The blood was confirmed
to be Wen Yong's.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.481
But not much.

00:28:16.481 --> 00:28:18.400
It didn't appear
to be from a fatal injury.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:29.160
(Yunxi Police)

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.880
Why did you bring me in again?

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.521
Yes.

00:28:34.521 --> 00:28:36.001
I was wrong before.

00:28:36.241 --> 00:28:37.761
I shouldn't get into that business.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.761
But I've truly
turned over a new leaf now.

00:28:45.481 --> 00:28:46.400
What did you say?

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.360
Turned over a new leaf?

00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:50.360
You killed Wen Yong, right?

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.160
No.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.400
No! H-How could it possibly be me?

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.600
Turned over a new leaf.

00:28:57.201 --> 00:28:59.800
Bloodstains were found at the scene.

00:29:00.921 --> 00:29:03.880
Since you were the last person
to see Wen Yong,

00:29:04.041 --> 00:29:06.761
we suspect you murdered Wen Yong

00:29:07.281 --> 00:29:09.681
and then hid the body.

00:29:09.681 --> 00:29:10.921
No.

00:29:11.681 --> 00:29:13.080
There was someone else back there.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.721
Who?

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.360
A woman.

00:29:17.521 --> 00:29:19.320
But I don't know her.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.281
I don't know who she was.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.721
But it really wasn't me.

00:29:29.041 --> 00:29:31.041
Run! Keep running!

00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:32.041
Run!

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.120
Run!

00:29:36.001 --> 00:29:38.721
Run, run, run!

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.281
Run! Run, run!

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.481
Run, run, run!

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.320
Run!

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.721
I'm telling you! Don't you dare
try running one more time!

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.400
Run!

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.160
Come on, run!

00:29:52.041 --> 00:29:53.120
Can't you see?

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.761
Run! Run! Run!

00:29:56.761 --> 00:29:58.600
Go on, run!

00:29:59.041 --> 00:29:59.840
Run!

00:30:00.921 --> 00:30:01.880
Will you run again?

00:30:03.721 --> 00:30:04.441
Run!

00:30:04.681 --> 00:30:05.600
Just try running!

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:13.961
Who's there?

00:30:25.961 --> 00:30:27.481
I...

00:30:27.481 --> 00:30:28.721
I didn't see anything. I...

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.241
I didn't see it. I...

00:30:40.721 --> 00:30:41.880
He lived violence.

00:30:43.281 --> 00:30:45.201
I heard he treated his wife
the same way.

00:30:46.441 --> 00:30:48.880
None of the other girls
wanted to deal with him.

00:30:50.241 --> 00:30:53.521
I only tolerated him
because he paid well.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.961
Who'd want to provoke someone like that?

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.441
What did the woman look like?

00:30:59.241 --> 00:31:00.320
How tall was she?

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.360
Very tall.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.400
Even taller than Wen Yong.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.600
Very thin.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.320
As for her appearance...

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.481
It was too dark that night.

00:31:11.721 --> 00:31:13.481
And I was scared.

00:31:13.961 --> 00:31:15.521
I only glanced briefly.

00:31:15.521 --> 00:31:17.160
Didn't dare look closely.

00:31:20.721 --> 00:31:22.400
Come, take a look.

00:31:23.041 --> 00:31:24.041
Who is it?

00:31:27.681 --> 00:31:28.721
It looks like her.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.281
So she really killed Wen Yong?

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.160
I thought his wife did it.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.160
Why would you think that?

00:31:44.961 --> 00:31:46.681
Haven't you seen that video?

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.800
The one that went viral recently.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.481
Titled Female Teacher Suffers
Domestic Violence in Public.

00:31:54.921 --> 00:31:56.921
Her face was pixelated in the video.

00:31:56.961 --> 00:31:59.041
But I recognized the man's build.

00:31:59.201 --> 00:32:00.160
It was Wen Yong.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.600
(Stop hitting!)

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.120
(Stop hitting her!)

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:21.848
(Move aside!)

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.281
This is the unedited version
obtained from the uploader.

00:32:26.281 --> 00:32:27.320
No pixelation.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.721
The video confirms

00:32:28.721 --> 00:32:30.600
these two are Wen Yong and his wife.

00:32:30.961 --> 00:32:33.160
This incident occurred two months ago.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.281
A passerby recorded it
and posted it online.

00:32:36.481 --> 00:32:39.360
Wen Yong's wife is a teacher
at a key high school in our city.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.880
It caused quite a stir
after she was recognized.

00:32:42.241 --> 00:32:45.521
Later, we heard Wen Yong's wife
had someone take down the video.

00:32:45.521 --> 00:32:46.560
to protect her job.

00:32:47.281 --> 00:32:49.840
If Wen Yong and his wife
had a strained relationship,

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.961
his wife could have benefited
from his disappearance.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.800
Then why was she
so determined to find him?

00:32:55.441 --> 00:32:56.400
It's hard to say.

00:32:56.721 --> 00:33:00.001
Wen Yong's wife did have
a solid alibi at the time.

00:33:00.921 --> 00:33:04.880
And Jiang Xiaohua found the attacker
looked like Gao Liang's girlfriend.

00:33:05.281 --> 00:33:06.600
Pull up that sketch.

00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:15.201
So far, that fingerprint
has been found at four locations.

00:33:15.721 --> 00:33:17.281
Namely, the Cheng Jianmin case,

00:33:17.281 --> 00:33:18.320
the Zhou Lianqin case,

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.376
the Wen Yong case,
and the Liu Xiaofeng case.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.160
The current evidence
on Cheng Jianmin's death

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.281
is insufficient to be classified
as a case.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:30.400
But there was testimony that Wen Yong
had been attacked at the scene.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.961
The forensic unit's analysis

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.201
revealed that the marks
on the roof beam,

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.880
were likely not left
by Zhou Lianqin himself.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.600
So the alleged suicide
has inconsistencies.

00:33:41.681 --> 00:33:45.360
While there's clearer evidence
that Liu Xiaofeng was murdered.

00:33:46.241 --> 00:33:48.080
In the Cheng Jianmin
and Zhou Lianqin cases,

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:52.001
the suspect at the scene
was an unidentified young male.

00:33:53.041 --> 00:33:54.721
But in the Wen Yong
and Liu Xiaofeng cases,

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.600
it was this unidentified young female.

00:33:57.921 --> 00:34:01.560
Now, we only know she's the girlfriend
of someone named Gao Liang.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.600
Gao Liang's identity
remains unknown as well.

00:34:06.001 --> 00:34:08.600
He's also linked to that arson case
in the urban village.

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.200
Through witness interrogations,

00:34:11.441 --> 00:34:13.361
we identified Gao Liang

00:34:13.361 --> 00:34:17.600
bears significant resemblance
to the suspect in the first two cases.

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.521
If we confirm it's the same person,

00:34:20.881 --> 00:34:21.961
we can state

00:34:22.521 --> 00:34:27.521
that this couple is central
to all these cases.

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.521
Assuming all these are connected cases,

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.560
what's their motive?

00:34:38.521 --> 00:34:41.961
Ordinary crimes usually involve money,
relationships, or revenge.

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.640
But these victims

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.200
have no connections
in work or personal lives.

00:34:47.961 --> 00:34:51.881
It's unlikely for them to hold grudges
against so many simultaneously.

00:34:52.521 --> 00:34:54.600
So we can't rule out contract killings.

00:34:54.881 --> 00:34:55.881
Is this a TV drama plot?

00:34:56.041 --> 00:34:58.160
A criminal duo hiring hitmen?

00:35:00.441 --> 00:35:01.600
Hard to tell.

00:35:01.961 --> 00:35:04.760
The killers might not
be motivated by money,

00:35:04.881 --> 00:35:07.001
but by purposes unknown to us.

00:35:07.881 --> 00:35:09.481
Aside from Cheng Jianmin's case,

00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:13.600
the subsequent cases
share some common threads.

00:35:13.841 --> 00:35:15.321
Of course, this is just my analysis.

00:35:15.321 --> 00:35:16.521
It might not be accurate.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.200
Zhou Lianqin,

00:35:19.001 --> 00:35:19.921
a debt-dodging deadbeat

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.560
who collected funds and vanished.

00:35:21.912 --> 00:35:23.736
Wen Yong,
domestic violence and prostitution.

00:35:24.321 --> 00:35:26.001
Liu Xiaofeng tortured
and killed animals,

00:35:26.001 --> 00:35:27.560
planning to harm people.

00:35:28.921 --> 00:35:32.801
Perhaps the killers see them
as deserving punishment.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.441
Oh, my.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.001
He thinks he's Batman?

00:35:37.401 --> 00:35:39.560
If that's true,
what do we need police for?

00:35:40.321 --> 00:35:41.441
What's bizarre

00:35:41.441 --> 00:35:43.001
is that the killer knows things

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.160
we police don't.

00:35:44.921 --> 00:35:45.961
Internet hot topics.

00:35:46.921 --> 00:35:48.801
They all appeared in a local forum

00:35:49.481 --> 00:35:51.280
as Internet hot topics.

00:35:51.961 --> 00:35:54.600
Wen Yong's abuse video
first surfaced there.

00:35:54.841 --> 00:35:59.280
Liu Xiaofeng also contacted
that woman via the forum.

00:36:00.361 --> 00:36:05.280
People still post condemnations
of Zhou Lianqin there today.

00:36:08.921 --> 00:36:14.321
Cheng Jianmin must have had
undisclosed issues.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.680
Do you think your apprentice's idea
make sense?

00:36:20.401 --> 00:36:21.481
It has merit.

00:36:22.001 --> 00:36:24.680
Currently, there's no better angle.

00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:29.441
The evidence linking these cases
isn't solid enough.

00:36:29.441 --> 00:36:31.560
Thankfully, no major cases are ongoing.

00:36:31.881 --> 00:36:32.521
By the way,

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.240
how's Ye's state of mind?

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.080
Any improvement?

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.120
Staying busy helps.

00:36:38.361 --> 00:36:38.961
Yeah.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.120
He arrives early daily

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.361
and leaves late.

00:36:42.361 --> 00:36:43.801
Completely immersed in the case.

00:36:43.961 --> 00:36:44.680
By the way,

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.120
they wanted to commend him
on the provincial level lately.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.200
He declined.

00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:55.680
This case is highly complex.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.961
You've all worked hard.

00:36:56.961 --> 00:36:58.560
Especially Ye Qian.

00:36:59.001 --> 00:36:59.560
Not at all.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.401
Just doing my job.

00:37:01.001 --> 00:37:02.361
I'm growing increasingly uneasy

00:37:02.361 --> 00:37:04.160
about this case now.

00:37:04.361 --> 00:37:04.961
- Okay.
- Come on.

00:37:04.961 --> 00:37:05.640
Put it here.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.120
Put it here.

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.041
Join us for dinner.

00:37:07.441 --> 00:37:07.881
No, thanks.

00:37:07.881 --> 00:37:09.120
I won't eat with you all.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.080
I'll go feed the dog.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.280
- Enjoy your meal.
- Okay.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.921
Listen. Right now,

00:37:13.481 --> 00:37:15.881
as soon as I clock out,
I have to come pick up Qiao Jing.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.321
We lock up together
and go home together.

00:37:19.321 --> 00:37:21.280
I wouldn't feel right
leaving her here alone.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.600
Is Jing okay?

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:23.921
She's fine.

00:37:25.521 --> 00:37:26.321
No, Ziwu.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.801
You're a girl.

00:37:27.801 --> 00:37:28.881
You need to be careful.

00:37:29.041 --> 00:37:29.961
I'm fine.

00:37:30.401 --> 00:37:32.280
The family compound
is close to the office.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.321
And all old friends there.

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.041
That won't do.

00:37:35.041 --> 00:37:36.841
You should still head home early.

00:37:37.441 --> 00:37:38.240
Got it.

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.521
Come on. Eat up.

00:37:46.041 --> 00:37:50.041
All four crime scenes
had female left index fingerprints.

00:37:50.321 --> 00:37:51.481
While at the internet café,

00:37:51.841 --> 00:37:54.361
that woman in red opened the door
with her right hand.

00:37:54.801 --> 00:37:57.760
And the ridge patterns match perfectly.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.881
Clearly, she left
the prints intentionally.

00:37:59.881 --> 00:38:00.521
That means

00:38:00.521 --> 00:38:02.760
she's not afraid of us tracing her.

00:38:03.001 --> 00:38:04.160
If that's the case,

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.240
this fingerprint
is actually a signature.

00:38:06.481 --> 00:38:09.120
It's just like those serial killers
with histrionic traits,

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.801
who leave calling cards at crime scenes

00:38:11.801 --> 00:38:13.600
to claim credit.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.361
In Liu Xiaofeng's case, the rooftop
had two sets of male footprints,

00:38:16.361 --> 00:38:19.041
yet surveillance shows a woman there.

00:38:19.041 --> 00:38:21.961
Chief Xu said Gao Liang
and his girlfriend have similar builds.

00:38:22.521 --> 00:38:24.441
And they've never been seen together.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.720
So we should consider
they might be the same person.

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:28.921
Makes sense.

00:38:29.801 --> 00:38:32.041
I'm wondering
why the suspect is so confident,

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.720
unafraid we'll trace this fingerprint.

00:38:35.921 --> 00:38:36.921
There's one possibility.

00:38:38.361 --> 00:38:43.200
This person's fingerprints
are untraceable.

00:38:43.481 --> 00:38:44.720
I agree with Long's theory.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.041
A neighboring province had a case

00:38:47.361 --> 00:38:50.080
where a mortuary worker
cut off corpses' fingerprints

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.760
and glued them to his own hands.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.881
It caused quite a stir.

00:38:53.041 --> 00:38:55.600
Could our suspect
be doing something similar?

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.640
We'll resume the Wen Yong case tomorrow.

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.080
Hurry up and eat.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.720
Got deliveries after this.
