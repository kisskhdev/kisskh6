{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:57.145 --> 00:01:58.065
Uncle Luo?

00:01:58.665 --> 00:01:59.505
When did you get here?

00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:01.985
You can finally come in.

00:02:02.945 --> 00:02:05.105
Since His Majesty lifted your confinement,

00:02:05.185 --> 00:02:09.144
I've been waiting
for justice to finally come.

00:02:11.024 --> 00:02:12.625
Justice won't just show up.

00:02:13.305 --> 00:02:14.225
You have to fight for it.

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:17.785
That's the Prince of Duan's daughter
for you.

00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:20.065
Here. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:22.305 --> 00:02:25.625
I was worried
you'd be tied down by finery,

00:02:25.705 --> 00:02:28.105
a marriage contract,
and a princess's title,

00:02:28.185 --> 00:02:29.145
unable to move.

00:02:31.225 --> 00:02:32.945
If that could bind me,

00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:35.105
I'd have died countless times by now.

00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:38.385
I stay alive for revenge.

00:02:39.585 --> 00:02:40.545
Then,

00:02:41.105 --> 00:02:44.025
we should pay respects
to the Prince of Duan's spirit.

00:02:46.545 --> 00:02:49.905
I won't drink it
until I kill the enemy myself.

00:02:52.985 --> 00:02:53.905
What's your plan?

00:02:54.585 --> 00:02:58.225
If His Majesty won't name him,
we'll make him show himself.

00:02:59.385 --> 00:03:00.705
With just you,

00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:04.305
I'm afraid you can't bring him down.

00:03:04.905 --> 00:03:06.145
It's enough.

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:07.505
What do you need me to do?

00:03:08.385 --> 00:03:09.345
Keep the house safe for me.

00:03:16.385 --> 00:03:18.305
I've been tracking
Lv Chongshan's whereabouts,

00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:20.185
but he's extremely cautious.

00:03:20.265 --> 00:03:21.905
He hasn't shown up
in Western capital so far.

00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:23.505
This time is different.

00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:26.025
His master has already been exposed
before His Majesty.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.145
His master will need a scapegoat.

00:03:27.225 --> 00:03:28.665
If we use that as bait,

00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:31.465
we might lure him out.

00:03:35.785 --> 00:03:37.705
But your wedding
to Princess Yong'an is near.

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:39.105
Why move now?

00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:46.825
She's carried that hatred
all alone for 15 years.

00:03:48.025 --> 00:03:50.705
I want to settle the past for her
before the wedding,

00:03:50.785 --> 00:03:53.585
so she can live a different life.

00:03:54.665 --> 00:03:55.745
Mr. Xiao,

00:03:56.265 --> 00:03:58.025
that's the mark of a true man.

00:03:58.105 --> 00:03:59.185
I'll help you.

00:03:59.985 --> 00:04:00.985
Thanks, Mr. Gu.

00:04:03.625 --> 00:04:04.705
Over here.

00:04:08.585 --> 00:04:09.545
Wipe it clean.

00:04:16.384 --> 00:04:18.145
Your Highness, come pick the table skirts.

00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:20.025
Then we'll taste dishes and pick wine.

00:04:20.624 --> 00:04:21.785
The invitations are out?

00:04:21.865 --> 00:04:23.865
Yes, to every address on the list.

00:04:24.545 --> 00:04:25.545
Has everyone confirmed their attendance?

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:28.465
In Consort Shu's name,
no one dares to skip it.

00:04:29.865 --> 00:04:33.065
Your Highness,
pick the pastries and sweets too.

00:04:33.145 --> 00:04:35.345
As for the seating, I made a quick list.

00:04:35.425 --> 00:04:36.825
Did I miss anything?

00:04:37.865 --> 00:04:40.025
Other than the wine,
you can decide everything.

00:04:40.705 --> 00:04:41.665
What wine are we using?

00:04:43.265 --> 00:04:44.225
Gentleman Wine.

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:46.585
How come I've never heard of it?

00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:48.905
You'll know tomorrow night.

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:53.465
Mr. Xiao!

00:04:55.305 --> 00:04:57.465
Mr. Xiao, your trick really is smart.

00:04:57.985 --> 00:04:59.825
After we spread the word
about the high bounty

00:04:59.905 --> 00:05:01.185
on Lv Chongshan's head,

00:05:01.265 --> 00:05:02.465
he couldn't sit still.

00:05:02.545 --> 00:05:04.905
He thinks his master
is making him the scapegoat.

00:05:04.985 --> 00:05:06.825
He's searching everywhere
for help escaping the capital.

00:05:06.905 --> 00:05:08.065
When can we see him?

00:05:08.665 --> 00:05:11.665
The snakehead will meet him
tomorrow night in the woods by the ferry.

00:05:13.985 --> 00:05:16.225
Compared to us, he fears his master more.

00:05:16.305 --> 00:05:18.825
Once we catch him,
we should get the man behind it.

00:05:22.025 --> 00:05:23.345
You really won't tell Princess Yong'an?

00:05:25.705 --> 00:05:27.145
Tomorrow she's hosting
a banquet at her manor.

00:05:27.225 --> 00:05:28.545
No need to worry her.

00:05:28.625 --> 00:05:30.745
We'll tell her when it's done.

00:05:31.345 --> 00:05:32.185
Alright.

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.145
I'll pose as the snakehead
and meet him tomorrow night.

00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:36.985
I can't fight.

00:05:37.065 --> 00:05:38.225
Let me pose as the snakehead,

00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:39.465
and you cover me from the shadows.

00:05:39.545 --> 00:05:42.065
He'll be on guard with me,
so you strike when you can.

00:05:42.665 --> 00:05:43.425
Alright.

00:05:57.265 --> 00:05:59.465
GRACEFUL VIRTUE, TIMELY RAINS

00:06:05.945 --> 00:06:06.785
What are you thinking about?

00:06:07.865 --> 00:06:09.185
Tonight's banquet.

00:06:09.785 --> 00:06:11.665
It's rare to see you put thought
into this kind of thing.

00:06:13.585 --> 00:06:16.945
I hope after tonight,
everything will be different.

00:06:17.545 --> 00:06:18.545
What's so different about this banquet?

00:06:19.425 --> 00:06:22.545
After the banquet, I'll be wed to you.

00:06:29.065 --> 00:06:32.465
I hope after tonight,
everything will be different.

00:06:33.065 --> 00:06:34.985
After the banquet, I'll come see you.

00:06:35.745 --> 00:06:36.585
You're busy tonight?

00:06:37.665 --> 00:06:38.545
I'm on duty at the Astronomical Bureau.

00:06:39.865 --> 00:06:41.105
Then focus on your shift.

00:06:41.185 --> 00:06:42.785
Tomorrow morning is fine too.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:45.065
Wait for me.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.585
We can't ride any farther.

00:07:13.665 --> 00:07:15.625
Lv Chongshan is running for his life.

00:07:15.705 --> 00:07:16.705
He won't make a move so easily.

00:07:16.785 --> 00:07:19.305
All we need to do
is follow the snakehead's plan,

00:07:19.385 --> 00:07:20.225
win his trust,

00:07:20.305 --> 00:07:22.705
get him onto our boat, and it's done.

00:07:22.785 --> 00:07:23.865
Relax.

00:07:24.665 --> 00:07:27.545
I'll circle behind him, so you'll be safe.

00:07:29.145 --> 00:07:29.985
It's almost time.

00:07:30.065 --> 00:07:31.185
Let's go.

00:07:36.065 --> 00:07:41.665
{\an8}PROPITIOUS WINDS AND NOURISHING RAINS

00:07:47.545 --> 00:07:48.985
No need to be formal, everyone.

00:07:49.065 --> 00:07:51.505
Fruit and pastries, wine and dishes,

00:07:51.585 --> 00:07:52.625
help yourselves.

00:07:55.185 --> 00:07:57.305
This wine tastes so unusual.

00:07:57.385 --> 00:07:58.465
I've never had it before.

00:07:59.425 --> 00:08:00.385
What wine is this?

00:08:00.465 --> 00:08:01.865
It's Gentleman Wine,

00:08:01.945 --> 00:08:04.465
specially prepared
by Princess Yong'an for everyone.

00:08:04.545 --> 00:08:06.945
Why only Gentleman Wine?

00:08:07.025 --> 00:08:08.665
Where's the Lady Wine?

00:08:11.185 --> 00:08:13.865
Lady Wine is for a gentleman to win over.

00:08:16.745 --> 00:08:18.665
This taste is really something.

00:08:18.745 --> 00:08:21.425
There's a beech-mushroom aroma.

00:08:22.625 --> 00:08:24.065
Sir, you have fine taste.

00:08:24.145 --> 00:08:26.785
In this wine, we added
beech mushrooms and matsutake,

00:08:26.865 --> 00:08:29.985
so in late autumn,
you can still taste fresh mushrooms.

00:08:49.025 --> 00:08:50.385
EAST

00:09:37.105 --> 00:09:37.905
Tonight!

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:40.385
Where's the money?

00:10:44.505 --> 00:10:45.585
It's you?

00:10:45.665 --> 00:10:46.585
It's you?

00:10:46.665 --> 00:10:49.665
Something felt off about the snakehead…

00:10:53.745 --> 00:10:54.825
Mr. Xiao?

00:10:54.905 --> 00:10:56.145
I got word

00:10:56.225 --> 00:10:58.105
Lv Chongshan would meet
the snakehead today

00:10:58.185 --> 00:10:59.465
and slip out of the capital.

00:10:59.545 --> 00:11:01.145
So Mr. Xiao and I posed
as the snakehead to meet him.

00:11:01.225 --> 00:11:03.825
Once we caught him,
we'd find the one behind it.

00:11:03.905 --> 00:11:06.585
I heard Lv Chongshan's master
sent plenty of spies to find him,

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:08.585
so I posed as Lv Chongshan
and met with the spies.

00:11:08.665 --> 00:11:10.825
If we caught a spy, we'd find his master.

00:11:11.865 --> 00:11:13.065
Who knew it'd be you two.

00:11:14.265 --> 00:11:15.185
We've been tricked.

00:11:15.905 --> 00:11:17.585
Oh no. It's the boss.

00:11:17.665 --> 00:11:18.985
She lured us to the outskirts on purpose.

00:11:21.945 --> 00:11:25.625
The Prince of Duan's manor
may be short on people,

00:11:25.705 --> 00:11:27.705
but Her Highness
should still receive her guests.

00:11:28.225 --> 00:11:31.425
Sir, this is the Princess's Mansion now.

00:11:31.505 --> 00:11:33.665
She's the lady of the house
and a bride-to-be.

00:11:33.745 --> 00:11:35.905
Her attention is quite divided.

00:11:37.225 --> 00:11:38.865
The Right Chancellor is here!

00:11:43.425 --> 00:11:44.665
Right Chancellor!

00:11:53.345 --> 00:11:55.465
Good. Sit, everyone.

00:12:10.705 --> 00:12:12.545
Why are you all staring at me,

00:12:12.625 --> 00:12:14.665
like I'm the host or something?

00:12:15.185 --> 00:12:16.105
Where's Peiyi?

00:12:20.185 --> 00:12:21.625
Look at me, so impatient.

00:12:22.425 --> 00:12:25.185
I still think of her
as the child raised by my sister.

00:12:25.785 --> 00:12:28.625
I actually forgot
she's a titled princess now!

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:33.825
Everyone,

00:12:34.585 --> 00:12:37.385
you've heard the music and had the wine.

00:12:37.985 --> 00:12:40.225
When will Her Highness show herself?

00:12:42.065 --> 00:12:43.785
Princess Yong'an, Li Peiyi,

00:12:43.865 --> 00:12:45.785
thank you for coming to my banquet.

00:12:50.825 --> 00:12:52.905
I have three cups to share with you all.

00:12:52.985 --> 00:12:54.305
There are three toasts tonight.

00:12:56.105 --> 00:12:58.305
First, to my rebirth.

00:12:58.385 --> 00:13:00.825
May I be blessed
after surviving the disaster.

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.625
Everyone, please.

00:13:03.185 --> 00:13:04.225
Please.

00:13:19.585 --> 00:13:20.425
There she is!

00:13:22.705 --> 00:13:23.665
Where?

00:13:23.745 --> 00:13:26.065
The banquet just started.

00:13:26.145 --> 00:13:27.745
You're seeing things already.

00:13:28.985 --> 00:13:31.785
Second, to my return
to the Prince of Duan's manor.

00:13:31.865 --> 00:13:34.305
It's a move-in and a homecoming.

00:13:35.665 --> 00:13:38.025
May we all regain what we've lost.

00:13:38.105 --> 00:13:38.985
Please.

00:13:43.265 --> 00:13:45.945
Third, I want to see an old acquaintance

00:13:46.465 --> 00:13:48.265
and recount an old story.

00:13:49.345 --> 00:13:51.745
I hope to fulfill a long-held wish.

00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:54.105
You may feel dizzy and unwell,

00:13:54.185 --> 00:13:56.345
and your body may not obey you.

00:13:56.865 --> 00:13:57.985
Don't worry.

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:00.105
It's just the effects of toxic mushrooms.

00:14:00.185 --> 00:14:01.985
The wine is poisoned!

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:07.345
Your Highness…

00:14:07.865 --> 00:14:09.065
We have no grudge with you.

00:14:09.145 --> 00:14:11.105
Why poison the wine?

00:14:11.185 --> 00:14:12.985
- Why harm us?
- Any grudge or not?

00:14:13.065 --> 00:14:14.745
You'll know soon.

00:14:14.825 --> 00:14:16.625
These toxic mushrooms are fierce,

00:14:16.705 --> 00:14:18.465
but they won't kill you.

00:14:18.545 --> 00:14:20.305
So be patient,

00:14:20.825 --> 00:14:23.025
and hear me out.

00:14:23.545 --> 00:14:25.465
- If I'm in a good mood,
- You…

00:14:25.545 --> 00:14:26.625
I might hand you the antidote.

00:14:26.705 --> 00:14:28.785
If you want revenge, go for the right man.

00:14:28.865 --> 00:14:30.825
You poisoned us for nothing,

00:14:30.905 --> 00:14:33.225
and now you want us to hear your story?

00:14:33.745 --> 00:14:35.945
Don't think just because you're a princess

00:14:36.025 --> 00:14:38.065
you can do whatever you want!

00:14:38.145 --> 00:14:39.065
Enough noise!

00:14:40.345 --> 00:14:43.465
Good. Then I'll start my story.

00:14:43.985 --> 00:14:45.945
What I'm about to tell
is what happened 15 years ago,

00:14:46.025 --> 00:14:48.225
when the Prince of Duan's household
was wiped out.

00:14:48.305 --> 00:14:49.705
I'm sure you've all heard of it.

00:14:50.665 --> 00:14:53.305
But I have a different version.

00:14:53.385 --> 00:14:54.225
GRACEFUL VIRTUE, TIMELY RAINS

00:14:54.305 --> 00:14:56.705
- Lantern Festival night, 15 years ago.
- My good girl.

00:14:56.785 --> 00:14:58.465
- It was right here.
- Come, your turn.

00:14:58.545 --> 00:15:00.145
My father, my mother, and I

00:15:00.225 --> 00:15:02.105
- watched the moon and painted lanterns.
- Let me see.

00:15:02.185 --> 00:15:03.425
So pretty!

00:15:03.505 --> 00:15:05.065
- The lantern burned me.
- It hurts!

00:15:06.585 --> 00:15:08.225
Mother carried me back to my room.

00:15:09.025 --> 00:15:10.665
Here, take your medicine.

00:15:24.545 --> 00:15:26.785
{\an8}I took a pill and fell asleep.

00:15:26.865 --> 00:15:28.265
{\an8}When I woke again,

00:15:29.065 --> 00:15:31.985
all I heard was screaming outside
and the sounds of fighting.

00:15:38.465 --> 00:15:40.945
I don't know how long
the slaughter lasted.

00:15:41.665 --> 00:15:43.665
Everywhere I looked was blood.

00:15:44.265 --> 00:15:46.705
Screams rang in my ears.

00:15:47.225 --> 00:15:49.745
That year, I was only eight.

00:15:50.945 --> 00:15:53.625
And I may have seen
more dead bodies than you will

00:15:53.705 --> 00:15:55.105
in your whole lives!

00:15:56.265 --> 00:15:58.945
By day, they were all living,
breathing people,

00:15:59.025 --> 00:16:00.385
playing with me.

00:16:01.505 --> 00:16:03.465
Among the dead

00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:05.945
were my father and mother.

00:16:06.025 --> 00:16:09.185
I know the one behind all this

00:16:09.265 --> 00:16:10.785
is among you.

00:16:11.305 --> 00:16:12.385
He hid it well.

00:16:12.465 --> 00:16:14.465
I searched for 15 years
and couldn't find him.

00:16:14.545 --> 00:16:16.425
So I made a decision.

00:16:16.505 --> 00:16:19.265
I'll kill you all.

00:16:20.705 --> 00:16:21.625
- Oh my!
- Murder! Run!

00:16:21.705 --> 00:16:22.665
Princess Yong'an is going to kill us!

00:16:23.705 --> 00:16:24.545
The Princess is killing!

00:16:24.625 --> 00:16:25.905
Murder!

00:16:29.785 --> 00:16:30.625
Let's run!

00:16:41.505 --> 00:16:44.025
So it was you, Right Chancellor.

00:16:45.065 --> 00:16:46.225
For 15 years,

00:16:46.945 --> 00:16:48.465
you made me search so hard.

00:16:49.185 --> 00:16:50.745
You hid it so well.

00:16:51.745 --> 00:16:52.825
Your Highness,

00:16:53.425 --> 00:16:56.305
I can't make sense of what you're saying.

00:16:56.385 --> 00:16:58.905
Everyone's been poisoned,

00:16:58.985 --> 00:17:01.065
crashing about like mindless insects.

00:17:01.145 --> 00:17:05.585
But only one person
felt guilty and was scared.

00:17:15.105 --> 00:17:17.184
He knew I wouldn't let it go,

00:17:19.025 --> 00:17:21.505
so he wouldn't touch a thing here.

00:17:21.585 --> 00:17:24.224
He knew the one way to get out fast.

00:17:24.305 --> 00:17:25.865
He knows this place best,

00:17:26.585 --> 00:17:29.265
because this is where he killed my father.

00:17:29.345 --> 00:17:32.025
And 15 years ago, he slipped away unseen

00:17:32.105 --> 00:17:34.025
from this very exit of this manor.

00:17:36.625 --> 00:17:37.545
Too bad.

00:17:37.625 --> 00:17:39.385
I've blocked the door.

00:17:40.825 --> 00:17:43.665
Today, you won't escape.

00:17:45.545 --> 00:17:46.585
Your Highness,

00:17:47.505 --> 00:17:49.585
you've handled cases for years.

00:17:49.665 --> 00:17:53.105
Don't you know convictions need evidence?

00:17:53.185 --> 00:17:56.025
You poisoned your own guests,

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:58.425
and that's your crime.

00:18:00.745 --> 00:18:04.465
I didn't fall for your trap,
and that's my caution.

00:18:05.345 --> 00:18:07.665
I don't drink. That's no crime.

00:18:07.745 --> 00:18:09.945
You come at me with a blade.

00:18:10.025 --> 00:18:11.025
If I turn to run,

00:18:11.625 --> 00:18:13.145
that's not a crime either.

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:15.585
Your scary little tale

00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:19.985
is just slander, utterly unconvincing!

00:18:21.505 --> 00:18:23.265
I don't need to convict you.

00:18:24.865 --> 00:18:26.225
I only need your life!

00:18:35.785 --> 00:18:37.385
Li Peiyi, (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:18:37.905 --> 00:18:41.345
you think I'd come unprepared
to your family banquet?

00:18:42.105 --> 00:18:44.945
Even if you didn't strike tonight,

00:18:45.025 --> 00:18:48.305
I'd still make sure you die
without a body left whole.

00:18:55.145 --> 00:18:56.305
Your Highness, I'm here!

00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:58.585
Tonight we'll avenge the Prince of Duan!

00:19:02.865 --> 00:19:04.945
The Jianning Iron Army
still has survivors?

00:19:06.185 --> 00:19:08.465
Back then, you couldn't protect
the Prince of Duan.

00:19:08.545 --> 00:19:09.505
Today you'll fail again!

00:19:21.105 --> 00:19:22.345
Uncle Luo!

00:19:37.065 --> 00:19:39.665
Back then, the Prince of Duan
died right here!

00:19:40.265 --> 00:19:42.985
Today, you can go join him!

00:20:04.265 --> 00:20:05.585
Well done!

00:20:05.665 --> 00:20:07.265
Well done!

00:20:07.345 --> 00:20:09.825
Much more interesting
than your simple-minded father.

00:20:09.905 --> 00:20:14.305
He knew I came
under imperial order to arrest him,

00:20:14.385 --> 00:20:18.145
yet he still hoped to see His Majesty.

00:20:20.225 --> 00:20:21.505
He missed his chance,

00:20:21.585 --> 00:20:23.665
and my men pinned him to his knees!

00:20:27.465 --> 00:20:31.025
I barely had to swing my sword,

00:20:31.105 --> 00:20:33.145
and he was dead.

00:20:35.705 --> 00:20:36.945
You dared kill a prince.

00:20:37.905 --> 00:20:39.345
Your crime deserves death!

00:20:43.905 --> 00:20:47.065
The Palace Investigation Bureau ruled
the Prince of Duan died by his own hand!

00:20:48.545 --> 00:20:50.465
After all, the blade that killed him

00:20:50.545 --> 00:20:52.585
was found in his own hand!

00:20:55.945 --> 00:20:57.145
Don't worry.

00:20:57.225 --> 00:20:59.185
I'll spin you a fine story too.

00:20:59.705 --> 00:21:02.465
I'll report it to His Majesty
and spread it across the court!

00:21:03.105 --> 00:21:06.185
Let's see who lives
to tell the story to His Majesty.

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.745
Then bring it on!

00:21:07.825 --> 00:21:09.065
I'm curious too.

00:21:28.585 --> 00:21:29.465
Lv Chongshan!

00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:44.985
Your Highness!

00:23:03.585 --> 00:23:04.745
Du Zhixing

00:23:04.825 --> 00:23:08.145
is not much of a teacher.

00:23:08.745 --> 00:23:10.225
Fifteen years,

00:23:10.825 --> 00:23:12.225
and is that all he taught you?

00:23:14.825 --> 00:23:15.865
Like him.

00:23:17.065 --> 00:23:18.065
Exactly like him.

00:23:18.985 --> 00:23:22.145
For 15 years, every sight of you

00:23:22.785 --> 00:23:25.185
brings back your father's eyes.

00:23:25.985 --> 00:23:27.945
He always stared at me just so.

00:23:29.425 --> 00:23:31.025
That look…

00:23:31.825 --> 00:23:33.025
of contempt…

00:23:33.905 --> 00:23:35.425
of anger…

00:23:37.945 --> 00:23:39.065
and of righteous fury.

00:23:40.105 --> 00:23:41.665
He provoked me.

00:23:41.745 --> 00:23:43.625
A martial upstart,

00:23:43.705 --> 00:23:46.265
meddling in army funds and corruption.

00:23:46.865 --> 00:23:50.425
Leaning on his title as a prince
and his war merits,

00:23:50.505 --> 00:23:53.465
he thought he could shake my foundation.

00:23:54.065 --> 00:23:57.465
But in the end, the heavens sided with me.

00:23:58.425 --> 00:24:00.465
"Mars invades the Heart."

00:24:05.185 --> 00:24:07.265
A perfect omen to frame him!

00:24:07.345 --> 00:24:11.625
The stars played their part
to lend me a hand.

00:24:11.705 --> 00:24:14.825
Everything lined up.

00:24:15.345 --> 00:24:17.185
So you see, I didn't murder him.

00:24:18.425 --> 00:24:22.625
It was fate taking its course.

00:24:24.625 --> 00:24:26.705
Now it's your turn.

00:24:28.505 --> 00:24:29.705
You'll die

00:24:29.785 --> 00:24:33.145
on the very stones
your father's blood stained.

00:24:33.825 --> 00:24:38.745
Isn't that a family reunion?

00:24:56.265 --> 00:24:58.105
Kill her! Kill her!

00:25:34.385 --> 00:25:35.705
Your Highness!

00:25:41.345 --> 00:25:43.145
You've always been a man of few words.

00:25:43.225 --> 00:25:45.665
But once people get smug, they slip.

00:25:45.745 --> 00:25:48.985
You must regret having said so much to me.

00:25:52.505 --> 00:25:53.625
Any backup?

00:25:54.745 --> 00:25:56.625
If not, kneel down,

00:25:57.145 --> 00:25:58.705
and let me take your life.

00:26:02.185 --> 00:26:03.025
Peiyi!

00:26:04.705 --> 00:26:06.425
Deputy Director Xiao, you're just in time.

00:26:06.505 --> 00:26:08.305
Look, Princess Yong'an has gone mad.

00:26:08.385 --> 00:26:10.265
She killed everyone.

00:26:10.345 --> 00:26:11.905
- She has the Prince of Duan's madness--
- Shut up!

00:26:14.385 --> 00:26:16.225
You're too weak to lift a thing.

00:26:16.825 --> 00:26:19.145
He's a Deputy Director
who can't throw a punch.

00:26:20.745 --> 00:26:22.305
Who can stop a madwoman?

00:26:25.545 --> 00:26:26.865
Peiyi.

00:26:28.905 --> 00:26:29.745
Put the sword down.

00:26:29.825 --> 00:26:30.825
Kill him!

00:26:30.905 --> 00:26:31.865
No!

00:26:32.785 --> 00:26:33.985
You're trying to stop me
from getting revenge?

00:26:36.105 --> 00:26:37.145
No.

00:26:37.985 --> 00:26:39.545
I'm stopping you
from doing the wrong thing.

00:26:40.145 --> 00:26:43.145
Cutting down my enemy, how is that wrong?

00:26:43.985 --> 00:26:45.385
He's a court official.

00:26:45.905 --> 00:26:47.825
Every guest tonight is a witness.

00:26:48.625 --> 00:26:51.265
If you kill him, you wouldn't survive it.

00:27:00.025 --> 00:27:00.985
Do you smell it?

00:27:01.985 --> 00:27:03.225
What?

00:27:05.145 --> 00:27:05.985
The smell of blood.

00:27:09.385 --> 00:27:11.145
Whenever I have nightmares,

00:27:12.705 --> 00:27:14.225
I smell that same blood.

00:27:18.585 --> 00:27:19.825
Once I kill him,

00:27:21.305 --> 00:27:22.865
my nightmares will end.

00:27:25.225 --> 00:27:27.505
That smell won't scare me anymore.

00:27:27.585 --> 00:27:29.345
It'll be the taste of my revenge!

00:27:29.425 --> 00:27:31.545
But I'm afraid you'll have new nightmares.

00:27:31.625 --> 00:27:34.105
I'm afraid he'll drag you down to hell.

00:27:35.785 --> 00:27:37.065
I'm not afraid of hell,

00:27:39.305 --> 00:27:40.825
as long as he goes with me.

00:27:41.545 --> 00:27:42.785
Peiyi!

00:27:51.105 --> 00:27:52.665
Her Highness shouldn't dirty her hands.

00:27:52.745 --> 00:27:55.305
- Let me do it!
- No!

00:27:56.145 --> 00:27:57.185
You…

00:27:58.065 --> 00:27:59.825
That old bastard confessed it himself.

00:27:59.905 --> 00:28:00.985
It was him.

00:28:01.065 --> 00:28:03.305
He framed the Prince of Duan
with that star nonsense.

00:28:03.385 --> 00:28:06.025
He deliberately stopped the Prince of Duan
from seeing His Majesty.

00:28:06.105 --> 00:28:06.985
He forged the charge
that the Prince of Duan

00:28:07.065 --> 00:28:07.945
defied an imperial order!

00:28:08.025 --> 00:28:10.505
He killed an imperial prince
with his own hands!

00:28:10.585 --> 00:28:13.625
His guilt is clear.
Killing him isn't wrong!

00:28:14.985 --> 00:28:16.785
It took me 15 years…

00:28:19.025 --> 00:28:20.225
to remember that part.

00:28:23.945 --> 00:28:25.385
I risked my life

00:28:26.345 --> 00:28:28.425
to force out the man
who slaughtered my whole family.

00:28:31.545 --> 00:28:33.305
If I can't kill him,

00:28:34.185 --> 00:28:37.865
why didn't you let me die clueless
15 years ago?

00:28:40.105 --> 00:28:41.105
Peiyi.

00:28:42.785 --> 00:28:44.105
I'll go with you to see His Majesty.

00:28:44.745 --> 00:28:47.185
Now that Cui Minzhong
has confessed to every crime,

00:28:47.825 --> 00:28:49.865
His Majesty will give you justice.

00:28:49.945 --> 00:28:51.985
Tang law will give you justice.

00:28:52.585 --> 00:28:54.025
If he dies here,

00:28:54.945 --> 00:28:55.945
then there's no proof left.

00:28:56.025 --> 00:28:58.465
The Prince of Duan's name
will never be cleared.

00:29:01.105 --> 00:29:02.905
Deputy Director Xiao,
you're the one with a clear head.

00:29:02.985 --> 00:29:05.385
I'll tell His Majesty everything.

00:29:05.465 --> 00:29:07.345
- Take me to His Majesty!
- You…

00:29:10.905 --> 00:29:11.745
Peiyi.

00:29:12.345 --> 00:29:13.625
Your Highness!

00:29:13.705 --> 00:29:16.065
We waited 15 years.

00:29:16.145 --> 00:29:17.705
Are we really letting him off that easily?

00:29:17.785 --> 00:29:19.145
We're not letting him off!

00:29:24.505 --> 00:29:25.425
Peiyi,

00:29:26.625 --> 00:29:28.625
if you kill him now,
it's letting him off easy.

00:29:29.585 --> 00:29:31.905
He must confess before His Majesty
to every charge.

00:29:33.025 --> 00:29:36.625
He must confess before the whole realm
and give the Prince of Duan his justice.

00:29:37.705 --> 00:29:39.745
Search carefully!
Don't let a single one escape!

00:29:43.185 --> 00:29:45.705
The Imperial Guard can't find you here.
Leave, now.

00:29:45.785 --> 00:29:46.985
- You…
- Leave, now!

00:29:47.065 --> 00:29:50.185
- Help! Someone!
- Run!

00:29:50.265 --> 00:29:51.345
- Help!
- Leave now!

00:29:52.945 --> 00:29:53.825
Help!

00:29:56.425 --> 00:29:57.545
Peiyi!

00:29:58.505 --> 00:29:59.985
- Peiyi!
- Your Highness!

00:30:21.065 --> 00:30:22.745
Cui Minzhong slaughtered
the Prince of Duan's household

00:30:22.825 --> 00:30:23.985
15 years ago!

00:30:24.065 --> 00:30:26.145
Now he tried to kill Princess Yong'an.

00:30:26.225 --> 00:30:28.665
Take him into the palace
and report to His Majesty!

00:30:29.505 --> 00:30:31.465
And Lv Chongshan's body, take it as well.

00:30:31.545 --> 00:30:32.465
Understood.

00:30:37.865 --> 00:30:39.225
Let go of me!

00:30:40.065 --> 00:30:42.425
You're escorting me to see His Majesty!

00:30:42.505 --> 00:30:43.665
Do you even understand?

00:30:56.465 --> 00:30:57.625
Cui Minzhong!

00:30:57.705 --> 00:30:59.465
How dare you!

00:30:59.545 --> 00:31:01.985
You used even me, deceived me!

00:31:54.585 --> 00:31:57.425
She's badly hurt,
but her life isn't in danger.

00:31:57.505 --> 00:31:58.585
Let me check on her.

00:31:59.785 --> 00:32:00.745
Let her rest properly.

00:32:03.265 --> 00:32:04.345
Let's go.

00:32:28.025 --> 00:32:31.825
THREE DAYS LATER

00:32:35.945 --> 00:32:36.905
Look at you.

00:32:37.585 --> 00:32:39.225
So gloomy again.

00:32:39.825 --> 00:32:42.225
Your Majesty, what is your judgment?

00:32:46.265 --> 00:32:48.785
I've suspended him from office.

00:32:49.545 --> 00:32:52.065
He is to return home,
copy scriptures, and repent.

00:32:53.105 --> 00:32:54.305
Suspended? (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:32:56.145 --> 00:32:57.785
You didn't even strip him of his rank?

00:32:58.825 --> 00:33:00.825
He killed dozens in my household.

00:33:01.345 --> 00:33:02.825
He murdered Your Majesty's brother.

00:33:03.345 --> 00:33:04.945
He tried to kill me again and again.

00:33:05.625 --> 00:33:08.505
And for all that, his sentence
is to copy scriptures?

00:33:12.865 --> 00:33:14.225
He's the Right Chancellor.

00:33:14.945 --> 00:33:16.145
If I killed him outright,

00:33:16.745 --> 00:33:18.865
within three days,
the court would be in chaos.

00:33:18.945 --> 00:33:21.865
His opponents would fight to replace him.

00:33:22.465 --> 00:33:24.585
His faction would seek revenge.

00:33:24.665 --> 00:33:27.145
Everything he has
was given by Your Majesty.

00:33:28.385 --> 00:33:29.825
His opponents and his faction

00:33:29.905 --> 00:33:32.065
are also Your Majesty's subjects.

00:33:33.025 --> 00:33:34.785
By Your Majesty's reasoning,

00:33:36.025 --> 00:33:38.865
then is Great Tang of the Li family

00:33:39.625 --> 00:33:41.305
or of the Right Chancellor?

00:33:47.145 --> 00:33:49.865
I know you just found the one
who killed your parents.

00:33:50.385 --> 00:33:52.305
Grief has clouded your mind.
It is your grief speaking.

00:33:52.385 --> 00:33:54.385
I will overlook your offense.

00:33:55.905 --> 00:33:57.705
But if you overstep once more,

00:33:57.785 --> 00:34:01.505
I will show you whose court
this really is!

00:34:38.145 --> 00:34:38.985
Peiyi.

00:34:57.025 --> 00:34:58.025
Peiyi.

00:35:03.985 --> 00:35:05.345
Why wouldn't you let me kill him?

00:35:06.625 --> 00:35:07.465
Why?

00:35:09.185 --> 00:35:11.585
I don't want you to live
with the pain of killing.

00:35:12.385 --> 00:35:14.025
You're not a monster

00:35:14.825 --> 00:35:17.225
who can kill and still sleep at night.

00:35:17.945 --> 00:35:20.945
I've never known
what it feels like to sleep in peace.

00:35:22.105 --> 00:35:24.825
All I know is what it feels like
to lose everyone overnight.

00:35:25.665 --> 00:35:26.785
You don't understand anything.

00:35:28.105 --> 00:35:29.825
Why did you decide for me?

00:35:30.825 --> 00:35:32.265
You're right. I don't understand.

00:35:33.545 --> 00:35:35.065
I was just afraid you'd get hurt.

00:35:37.385 --> 00:35:39.025
But every time I worry,

00:35:40.465 --> 00:35:41.745
I end up stopping you,

00:35:42.345 --> 00:35:43.945
and it only brings you pain.

00:35:46.305 --> 00:35:48.545
You said revenge is what keeps you alive.

00:35:49.665 --> 00:35:53.345
So will every tomorrow be about revenge?

00:35:54.625 --> 00:35:55.745
And after you have it,

00:35:56.785 --> 00:35:58.065
what comes next?

00:36:02.385 --> 00:36:03.865
What can I do?

00:36:05.105 --> 00:36:06.385
Someone like me,

00:36:07.105 --> 00:36:10.785
can I still hope for some calm,

00:36:11.585 --> 00:36:13.265
happy life together?

00:36:14.385 --> 00:36:15.865
You've never hoped for it?

00:36:18.625 --> 00:36:19.865
Not once.

00:36:21.385 --> 00:36:23.985
Because I am nothing
but a curse to all around me.

00:36:25.025 --> 00:36:26.465
All I wanted was revenge.

00:36:27.545 --> 00:36:30.585
For revenge, I was ready
to make you an accomplice

00:36:30.665 --> 00:36:32.585
and to stain our wedding with blood.

00:36:32.665 --> 00:36:33.825
That's who I am.

00:36:35.225 --> 00:36:36.985
Then why did you send us all away?

00:36:38.185 --> 00:36:39.665
If it wasn't to protect us,

00:36:39.745 --> 00:36:42.705
why set such a huge trap
and keep us far from your banquet?

00:36:43.865 --> 00:36:45.465
Maybe I just thought you'd get in my way.

00:36:47.585 --> 00:36:50.865
If you hadn't rushed back,
my revenge would be done by now.

00:36:52.865 --> 00:36:53.945
In your heart,

00:36:56.585 --> 00:36:57.985
did we ever matter to you?

00:36:59.305 --> 00:37:00.945
What were our feelings?

00:37:01.705 --> 00:37:03.265
What was this imperial marriage to you?

00:37:04.345 --> 00:37:05.785
If you killed the Right Chancellor,

00:37:06.945 --> 00:37:08.185
what would I have to bear?

00:37:11.265 --> 00:37:13.785
You think I'll drag your family down.

00:37:15.185 --> 00:37:16.185
Don't worry.

00:37:17.105 --> 00:37:19.745
I did this before the wedding.

00:37:20.625 --> 00:37:23.185
You remain the spotless heir.

00:37:23.785 --> 00:37:25.785
You'll still have a bright future.

00:37:26.865 --> 00:37:27.865
I won't implicate you.

00:37:30.905 --> 00:37:32.105
So in your eyes,

00:37:34.745 --> 00:37:36.305
I'm that kind of person?

00:37:38.305 --> 00:37:40.185
You think everything I did

00:37:42.385 --> 00:37:44.905
was only to keep my family
from being dragged down?

00:37:48.505 --> 00:37:49.505
Li Peiyi,

00:37:52.185 --> 00:37:54.385
I just can't bear to lose you.

00:38:00.265 --> 00:38:01.225
But now,

00:38:02.985 --> 00:38:04.225
I guess I can take it.

00:38:05.985 --> 00:38:07.785
I ruined your revenge.

00:38:10.385 --> 00:38:12.185
You ruined my marriage.

00:38:13.545 --> 00:38:15.465
Let's call it even.

00:38:33.145 --> 00:38:34.745
Then we're even.

00:38:36.665 --> 00:38:37.665
No one owes the other.

00:38:38.505 --> 00:38:39.425
Fine.

00:38:40.705 --> 00:38:42.025
We're even.

00:38:43.665 --> 00:38:44.985
No one owes the other.

00:40:36.185 --> 00:40:37.385
Did I…

00:40:38.985 --> 00:40:40.025
do the wrong thing?

00:41:42.065 --> 00:41:43.625
It's been over half a month.

00:41:43.705 --> 00:41:44.825
Why is he still not recovering?

00:41:44.905 --> 00:41:47.225
The young master's illness
lies in the heart.

00:41:47.305 --> 00:41:50.345
Medicine can restore his body
but can't fix his heart.

00:42:04.305 --> 00:42:06.065
Your Highness, you finally came out.

00:42:06.145 --> 00:42:07.865
Are you going out?

00:42:07.945 --> 00:42:09.105
I'm going to the palace.

00:42:12.305 --> 00:42:13.585
Your Majesty, please allow me

00:42:13.665 --> 00:42:15.545
to resign
from the Palace Investigation Bureau,

00:42:15.625 --> 00:42:17.145
strip me of my princess title,

00:42:17.705 --> 00:42:19.865
and also withdraw the marriage decree.

00:42:21.825 --> 00:42:23.865
While you've shut yourself away at home,

00:42:24.385 --> 00:42:27.465
the Right Chancellor has also
been shut away, copying scriptures.

00:42:28.265 --> 00:42:29.505
Are you still sulking with me?

00:42:29.585 --> 00:42:30.745
I'm not sulking.

00:42:31.665 --> 00:42:34.545
These duties are beyond my ability.

00:42:34.625 --> 00:42:35.705
So I choose to lay them all down.

00:42:35.785 --> 00:42:39.305
VIRTUE SHINING, EVER-PROGRESSING

00:42:39.385 --> 00:42:42.345
I never liked you working
at the Palace Investigation Bureau anyway.

00:42:42.425 --> 00:42:43.265
You may quit.

00:42:45.705 --> 00:42:47.145
The court is in turmoil now.

00:42:47.225 --> 00:42:49.425
Breaking off the marriage
at a time like this

00:42:49.505 --> 00:42:50.865
may hurt the Xiao family.

00:42:50.945 --> 00:42:53.465
Besides, the Deputy Director
is ill right now.

00:42:54.145 --> 00:42:55.105
Wait a little longer.

00:42:58.505 --> 00:43:00.425
As for your princess title…

00:43:01.185 --> 00:43:03.145
You poisoned the whole court.

00:43:03.745 --> 00:43:06.865
No one died,
but it was still wildly wrong!

00:43:06.945 --> 00:43:08.865
I must punish you, or I can't calm them!

00:43:11.145 --> 00:43:12.265
Alright.

00:43:12.345 --> 00:43:13.465
You may be the County Princess once more.

00:43:14.905 --> 00:43:16.145
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:43:19.385 --> 00:43:20.265
By the way,

00:43:20.865 --> 00:43:23.945
when you have time,
go see Consort Shu at Qinghui Palace.

00:43:24.545 --> 00:43:25.545
Qinghui Palace?

00:43:27.025 --> 00:43:28.265
The Cold Palace?

00:43:28.345 --> 00:43:30.505
She knows her brother
committed a grave wrong,

00:43:31.465 --> 00:43:34.225
so she asked to go there and reflect.

00:43:35.425 --> 00:43:36.265
When did this happen?

00:43:36.905 --> 00:43:38.385
The day you left the palace.

00:43:39.945 --> 00:43:42.465
What did she do wrong?

00:43:52.545 --> 00:43:53.385
Your Highness.

00:43:58.705 --> 00:43:59.785
You're avoiding me?

00:44:02.345 --> 00:44:05.305
My brother committed such a crime.

00:44:05.825 --> 00:44:07.905
I can't leave the palace to question him,

00:44:08.665 --> 00:44:10.425
and I don't know how to make it up to you.

00:44:10.945 --> 00:44:14.865
So I asked to come here to repent,
so you never have to see me again.

00:44:14.945 --> 00:44:18.385
Did you know about what Cui Minzhong did?

00:44:21.905 --> 00:44:23.425
If I had known,

00:44:24.665 --> 00:44:28.065
how could I have stayed with you
for all these years?

00:44:29.065 --> 00:44:32.265
When His Majesty judged the case,
did you plead for him?

00:44:34.145 --> 00:44:38.145
Such an inhuman crime
should be punished severely.

00:44:38.665 --> 00:44:40.865
Even if I were implicated, I deserve it.

00:44:41.545 --> 00:44:43.705
What right have I to plead his case?

00:44:44.945 --> 00:44:46.345
He did the killing.

00:44:46.985 --> 00:44:48.145
His Majesty passed the sentence.

00:44:48.785 --> 00:44:51.185
You knew nothing about it.

00:44:51.265 --> 00:44:54.985
And you've treated me
as your own for years.

00:44:55.065 --> 00:44:56.385
Why should you repent here?

00:44:58.825 --> 00:45:00.265
Do you regret raising me?

00:45:04.985 --> 00:45:06.585
How could I?

00:45:06.665 --> 00:45:08.545
You're my child.

00:45:09.545 --> 00:45:13.985
What mother would regret
raising her own child?

00:45:22.305 --> 00:45:23.465
Your Highness…

00:45:24.985 --> 00:45:25.985
I miss you so much.

00:45:29.185 --> 00:45:30.785
I miss you too.

00:45:35.185 --> 00:45:36.105
Peiyi…

00:45:37.665 --> 00:45:38.985
Are you…

00:45:40.625 --> 00:45:42.145
thinking of leaving?

00:45:46.465 --> 00:45:47.745
Where would you have me go?

00:45:49.305 --> 00:45:52.985
Are you thinking of leaving the palace,
leaving the capital?

00:45:53.865 --> 00:45:55.025
You're sending me away?

00:45:56.785 --> 00:45:58.025
Of course not.

00:45:59.025 --> 00:46:00.025
I'm just afraid…

00:46:01.385 --> 00:46:02.585
I'm afraid you'll…

00:46:04.585 --> 00:46:07.865
Now, I'm all you have left.

00:46:10.305 --> 00:46:11.505
And you're all I have left too.

00:46:12.345 --> 00:46:14.705
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll stay with you.
