00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.460
Khun Sasom, your father is asking to see you

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.990
If you become a brand ambassador

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.550
I’ll give you Ton Nam’s address

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.210
If you don’t do it

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.320
don’t expect to ever see Ton Nam again

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.590
Sometimes

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.780
my safe place

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.790
isn’t Peach Lover

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.520
It's Po

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.770
Yes

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.370
This is Khun Ngern, Sasom’s older brother

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.229
Hello

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.789
So, you must be...

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.000
Po

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.009
Yes

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.020
It’s okay, Po.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.050
He already knows about you and Khun Sasom

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.740
Okay

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.700
At least P’Ngern isn’t angry or jumping to conclusions

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.370
Hey

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.240
Hey , Lek

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.200
How’d you get here

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.990
I think you’re here to hand out wedding invitations

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.210
Didn’t know you had a guest with you

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.640
Not a guest

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.300
this is Po

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.440
You already know him

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.810
Yeah

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.500
but...

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.600
That’s enough, bro

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.150
Stop making that face

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.530
You can come by anytime , don’t overthink it.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.600
and

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.510
Isn’t Pin coming?

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.040
She go to Chaing Mai

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.230
She’s out at a bachelorette party with her friends

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.900
It smells so good.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.790
You…

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.710
So… are you going to eat now?

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.570
Mm.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.420
Wanna eat together?

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.980
It’s okay, Lek, go ahead

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.660
I didn’t say I was coming

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.390
There might not be enough.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.370
Not enough of what? Po made a lot

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.890
Alright

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.140
Come on.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.180
Let’s go.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.150
Hmm.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.720
Good, right

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.320
Yes

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.260
It tastes just like when we ate together in New York

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.900
The first time I had it,

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.580
I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.950
So I had to ask Po to make it for me again.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.420
I learned it from the internet

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.910
Lek

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.390
How could you make fun of Po like that?

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.340
What?

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.240
Well, I like him

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.750
He always surprises me

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.780
Po’s really good

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.810
Next time, can I borrow Po to cook for me again

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.900
Sure.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.440
Thank you.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.970
Here you go.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.130
Finally getting married, bro

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.380
Po, you’ll come to my wedding too , okay?

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.510
Thank you

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.060
Did you know? Peaches are very sensitive

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.570
to the weather

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.600
A winter too cold can stop peach blossoms from blooming

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:19.720
A summer too hot can make a peach shrivel and lose its sweetness

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:27.000
Even strong winds and heavy rain can make growing peaches fall too soon

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.320
But if there’s someone willing to protect and care for it…

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:40.980
That delicate peach may grow into the sweetest fruit of all—like a reward from nature

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.810
Come on, let me help you

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.330
go

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.360
What the crazy is this?

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.700
About Sasom and Po?

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.190
Yes

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.510
I never thought my brother would be like this

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.540
I can’t remember the last time I saw him this lively

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.800
Yeah, I guess so

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.450
He wasn’t even like this when he was with Ton Nam

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.750
You’re right.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.870
It seems he've finally found the right one

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.150
but

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.920
You know, Inn? Lek already has Ton Nam’s address

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.520
What?

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.409
He just got it yesterday

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.370
You’re saying…

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.930
he’s going back?

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.370
I don't know

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.880
I don't sure

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.360
So you’re going to the party tomorrow night?

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.660
Sure.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:09:00.270
invited me, then ignored me

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.200
Are you Po?

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:31.700
Yes

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.870
You’re with Sasom, aren’t you?

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.690
My last name is Chanyawatchara

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:44.490
and you?

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.650
My last name is Nawibunnit.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.870
Wow.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.510
But my father and I have cut ties

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.800
So I had to make my own way

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.730
Guess I’ll get rich when I’m older

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.500
Sounds good

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.650
Perfect!

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.350
Because neither of us gets along with our Dad

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.710
Thana

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.130
He's mine

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:46.720
yeah

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:50.200
You

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:51.730
Put your shirt on

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.300
You’re breaking the rules.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.860
Didn’t you say there were only two rules?

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.910
Just Put it

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.590
What wrong with you?

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.220
Are you being protective of me?

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.300
Why would you worry about me like that?

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.000
We’ll end up making a clip anyway

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.600
Then everyone’s going to see a lot more of me

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.200
You don’t have to worry

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.630
You

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.670
Enough. Stop talking like that.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.860
What?

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.800
Alright

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.260
if there’s something you want, say it.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.000
What did you bring me here for, anyway?

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.460
Or

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.470
is this only what I want?

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:47.640
I don’t know who I am anymore.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.180
I’ve done things I never thought I’d do

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.480
I let someone in

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.760
Closer than anyone’s ever been

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:07.570
Between him and me, it might not be love

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.330
It might just be desire

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.530
But even so, I choose to stay

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.380
Beside him

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:27.920
But maybe I’m searching for answers in what’s happening

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.630
What it really is

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.440
This is a memory I’m not sure about

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.640
Whether I even want to remember it

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.060
But if I’m going to stay here…

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.770
I’ll need to face it.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.110
What’s coming next

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.630
I’m going to leave here

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.620
Where are you going?

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.030
Anywhere

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.500
Somewhere no one knows me

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.150
Somewhere I won’t ever see you again

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.380
It’s not fair

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.770
Don’t leave me, Ton

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.060
No

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.520
I’ll handle this myself

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.550
No!

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.750
I don’t need you anymore

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.330
I want you to remember this

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.820
you’ve ruined my life

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.410
and you

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
made me dead inside

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.140
It’s time you took filming seriously

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.700
Are you being possessive of me?

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.630
Why would you be possessive of me?

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.430
We’ll have to make a video anyway

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.720
Then people will see a lot more of me.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.690
Did you know? In many cultures…

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.690
Peaches are often used as a symbol

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.390
of sexual desire

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.850
An alluring sweetness

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.830
But at the same time, peaches bruise easily

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:31.480
It only takes a little too much pressure

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.130
It can leave an ugly mark

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.330
That’s why… many artists

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:54.070
use the peach as a symbol of fragility in relationships

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:58.240
A relationship that needs care

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.510
And always treat each other gently

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.890
Remember… the taste of a peach becomes even sweeter

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.540
Only when you know how to care for it

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:14.100
With a gentle enough touch

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.670
Because sometimes, true desire…

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:22.160
Isn’t about possession

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.380
But in caring

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.610
So it can remain sweet.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.860
Are you awake?

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:04.020
Mm...

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.870
I wanted to wake up early just to see your face

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:10.870
No need to sweet-talk me

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.310
Are you going out today?

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:16.560
No

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.770
Today is my day off

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.000
I think

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:21.010
I’ll read the script

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:22.010
and

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.280
spend the whole day with you

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:28.210
Come on

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.000
Go take a shower.

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:31.530
I’ll make you breakfast

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:34.150
Let’s take a shower together

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:36.450
No

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.370
Every time we shower together

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:39.990
it never ends with just a shower

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.810
You go first

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:45.200
Go on

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:48.410
Hey

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.200
I’m not letting you go

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.350
I want you to shower with me

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.280
You

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.190
Let’s shower together

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.630
Come on

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:02.280
Go

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.280
Let't go

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:05.780
What?

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:06.600
Shower

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:07.710
me

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:08.570
Go where?

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.150
Hey,I can walk

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.130
The more time we spend together…

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.510
He’s even more suspicious.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.820
Everything about that party that night…

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.650
And Peach Lover.

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.560
Or even why he keeps coming to my place so often

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.160
Hey

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.350
when are we starting

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:21.010
to film?

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:24.720
After my airline shoot

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.560
we’ll start right away

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:42.500
How’s your script preparation going?

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:50.000
Here

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.850
A love confession scene?

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:55.500
Yes

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.100
The male lead barely opens up in this story.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.260
He overthinks everything

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.620
If we’d been honest from the start

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:06.990
it wouldn’t have turned this dramatic

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.090
So.

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.050
You don't like?

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.470
I think

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:17.650
it’s exciting

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:20.900
If it were easy from the start

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.370
it wouldn’t be fun

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.420
can you help me with something?

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.300
With what?

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.090
Help me rehearse the script

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.720
You sure?

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.690
sure

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.960
You can help me recheck

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.700
whether I remember the lines or not

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.360
What’s wrong with you?

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.150
No,

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:15.190
nothing's wrong.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:17.850
How could it be nothing?

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.520
You just punched Ekaphop

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:23.990
So what do you think I am, then?

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.510
How would I possibly know?

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.750
You always know nothing.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.530
Right,

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.380
tell me, then

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.000
say it

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.190
that

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.320
What’s wrong with you?

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.090
I love you

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:07.730
What do you mean?

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:18.180
That’s why… I hate him

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.770
Whenever Ekaphop comes around you,

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.640
it makes me feel jealous…

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:28.100
and possessive of you

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.890
I don't want anyone getting near you

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:11.590
Po, are you home?

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.700
Po!

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:16.140
Shit!

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:17.020
Po, you're home, aren't you?

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.500
My friend’s here

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.480
Po

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.710
Come on

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:25.160
Po

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.470
Po

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:35.990
What!

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.980
What the hell did you yelling for?

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.910
For ages you took as opening the door.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.340
I was using the toilet.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.310
Next time, you should call me before arriving,

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:52.500
If I called you first,

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.190
I would never see your hidden husband at all.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.980
What? Husband?

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.630
I don't remember I ever had one.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:58.980
Move!

00:27:58.980 --> 00:27:59.950
It's hot!

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.800
Po

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:09.720
Whose shoes are these?

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.620
Hey, Meen!

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:19.900
Hey, you!

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:24.610
Hello.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:25.850
You are…Sasom

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.190
How could you end up here?

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.580
Meen…

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:40.900
I can explain it.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.720
Well, try give me your explanation…

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.400
Well, Sasom are…

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.650
are helping me about my exhibition.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:52.360
How?

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.250
Alright,

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.690
you know, this is the very first-ever exhibition of my own,

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.260
I just want to pull in crowds,

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.860
like...make my works very popular,

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.210
so I reached out to Sasom

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.210
Reach out?

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.490
Then, how did you know his contact?

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.100
That...

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.320
On Instagram,

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.290
Po had reached out to me on Instagram.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:28.660
I thought it was quite interesting, and jump in as the sitter

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:32.510
For real?

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:35.200
For real.

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:37.150
And then,...

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.770
Have you both...

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:42.700
ever do it together yet?

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:53.270
I knew it, it's not about business things at all

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:56.660
I can see through all your lies

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.000
And you,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
May I have a talk with you, just between us?

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.650
Hey, what will you talk with him?

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.030
What the hell is your problem? Are you butting in?

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.290
Butting into what?

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:12.440
I mean, since me and him…

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.060
It’s okay, I’ll be right back.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.480
I’ll be right back.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.060
Please, this way.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.120
What were you talking to him about?

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:04.670
Why?

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:05.590
You wanna know that bad?

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:06.540
Yeah.

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.690
I do.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.560
Sorry, man. It’s a secret.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.030
Damn it, Mean.

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:17.030
Sasom,this stays between the two of us,

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.400
Right?

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:18.920
Yes.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.120
So… you’re involved with him too?

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:43.960
So…

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:46.930
What were you talking to him about?

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.680
Let’s leave that for now.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:54.480
Let’s talk about why I came to see you today first.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.930
About what?

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.650
About your dad.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.390
So...

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.960
Aunt Por just called me. You haven’t been answering her

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:16.690
Po

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:21.440
Your dad’s really sick, man

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.580
I heard it’s stage three cancer.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.540
So she wanted me to…

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.000
tell you to go see him for the last time.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.980
Enough, Meen.

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:36.630
I mean… your dad…

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:37.610
I’m begging you.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:46.140
Just pretend I didn’t say anything.

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:39.540
Po…

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:44.000
What’s wrong with you?

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:57.550
It’s okay.

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:00.000
I’m right here.

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:03.750
Whenever you’re ready,

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:05.980
you can tell me.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.240
I’m always ready to listen.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:16.100
You know… you’re coming here a bit too often now.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:20.000
Well, I like your coffee.

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.610
So what are you exactly, a bodyguard or...

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:26.530
an employee at the café?

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.300
I just want to stay by your side.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.320
Here you go.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.440
I made it for you already.

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:50.280
But don’t get used to it, I don’t do this often.

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.790
Just you making it for me is already enough.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:14.970
It’s delicious.

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:19.680
But…

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:23.870
the person standing here is even sweeter.

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:26.560
Do you want to taste?

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.950
Aren’t you working today?

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.360
I just wanted to see you…

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.570
I really couldn’t stop myself.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.130
But this time…

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.470
please don’t let it go any further than this.

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:34.390
You have no idea…

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.020
how much I miss you.

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:47.830
I’ve been waiting for this moment all day.

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:52.400
You're...

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:54.490
going crazy

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:00.190
I’m going crazy because of you

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:01.900
I'm sorry,

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:04.930
I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.890
Honestly, it’s not that uncomfortable.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.550
I just think… it shouldn’t happen again.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:22.990
But then again…

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:26.710
it’s not that bad.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.630
So…

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:31.940
can I have another round?

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:33.830
I’m still good.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:36.410
What about you?

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.140
You’re seriously shameless.

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:48.980
I’m not just shameless.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.690
Or…

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:54.830
you don’t like it?

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:57.900
I do.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:02.340
Then,

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:05.350
can I have another round?

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.280
Hey…

00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.450
Mm.

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:06.450
Can I ask you something?

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.680
Sure.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.250
Is it about what you and Meen talked about?

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.670
My dad is very sick.

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.260
Everyone there wants me to go back.

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:08.470
They talk as if…

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:10.510
he’s about to die.

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:19.130
But I really hate my dad.

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:22.760
I hate him too much to see him again.

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:26.430
But part of me…

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.160
I…

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.730
I… I also…

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.110
You want to go back and see him?

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:40.950
Yeah.

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:45.690
I hate him so much.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.740
I hate what he did to me and my mom.

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.050
But once I found out he was seriously ill…

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:57.380
I couldn’t stop thinking about him.

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.070
Do you think…

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:08.050
I should go see him?

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.280
You’re not a bad person, Po.

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:27.950
I can’t really answer that for you,

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:31.320
whether you should go see your dad or not.

00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:37.610
Because I don’t know

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.230
what your dad

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:43.610
did to you and your mom.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.050
But one thing I know for sure is this:

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:52.120
The path you choose

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:54.910
will affect your heart.

00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:58.950
So if you ask me,

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:01.370
you should choose the path

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:08.020
where your dad

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.530
can’t hurt you anymore.

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.410
That’s how I feel right now.

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:39.620
I’m going back to see my dad.

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:45.020
I’ll clear everything up while he’s still alive.

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:48.090
So in the future,

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.730
I won’t have to worry about this anymore.

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:57.030
That’s more like it,

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.000
Now that really suits you.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:11.940
Thank You

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:53.300
Who are you here to see?

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:56.180
We work for Mr. Thaweekhunn.

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:59.370
He sent us to take you,Mr. Po, to the Phetchaburi residence.

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:03.920
Did he say why?

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:08.640
He’s seriously ill and wants to see you.

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:11.710
Alright.

00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:13.490
I’ll go.

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:17.070
But tell my father this. I’ll drive myself.

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:20.000
As for you guys…

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.720
if you’re afraid I’ll run,

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:25.260
then just follow me in your own car.

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.580
Actually, Grandma didn’t want Mom to marry our dad at all.

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:02.790
Then… who did Grandma want you to marry?

00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:05.860
Her friend’s son. He was…

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:08.550
a hardworking man, polite in the way he spoke,

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:10.200
and very generous too.

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:13.510
Wow… with a profile that good,

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:15.790
if I were you, I’d marry him.

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:18.540
Well, I was stubborn.

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:21.850
If I wanted an easy life, I would’ve chosen a rich guy already.

00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:23.010
Right?

00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:26.070
Having good starting capital already means you’re more than halfway there.

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:28.710
See, that's the result of not listening to grandma.

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:30.570
Ended up crying it out in the end.

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.380
You do you, Mom.

00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:34.920
My son really goes hard with the teasing.

00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:36.670
Well, am I wrong?

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:39.540
Yeah, it’s true… but what could I do?

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.330
I loved your father.

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:45.790
Alright, keep drawing, sweetheart.

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:49.250
Mom…

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.380
I really don't want to see him.

00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:10.000
I’ve come so far already.

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.250
But in the end,

00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:18.660
I still get dragged back.

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.010
I really don’t understand

00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:24.180
why he won’t just let me go.

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:31.330
But this time, I probably can’t avoid it anymore.

00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:40.000
I won’t run away again.

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:44.630
I guess I have to go back to face him one more time.

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:50.000
Please be there for me, Mom.

00:54:58.100 --> 00:54:59.280
Mr. Po has agreed to go.

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:00.360
But he’ll go on his own.

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:02.900
We’ll follow behind.

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:06.140
Yes, sir.

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:08.320
Understood.

00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:09.580
Alright.

00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:13.610
If you won’t let me go by myself, then I won’t go at all.

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:33.020
Just agreeing to see him is already more than enough.

00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:35.870
Let’s not let this turn into something worse.

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:38.150
Besides…

00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:40.200
driving myself is more convenient,

00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:42.920
I can leave whenever I want.

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:44.650
I don’t need anyone’s permission.

00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:02.980
I heard you were sick

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:04.980
It’s none of your business

00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:06.500
So why did you ask me to come back?

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:08.280
Whatever dirty plan you’re plotting?

00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.980
Ordain for me

00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:14.660
How did you come here?

00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:16.230
Never mind that.

00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:18.420
How are you?
