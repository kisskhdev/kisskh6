WEBVTT

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:55.859
You two.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.959
For the Murder Mystery Game this weekend,

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.200
don't count me in.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.760
Why not?

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.560
You had a great time last time.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.680
It was fun.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.640
But this weekend,

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:09.620
the Grand Theatre is staging the Bolshoi's *Don Quixote*.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.120
I'm going to see it.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.919
The Bolshoi?

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.740
Yes.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.560
Who is that?

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:15.979
It's the Bolshoi Theatre of Moscow.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.840
You're going to Moscow?

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.259
Me?

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.120
No.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.020
Moscow...

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.879
It's in Russia, isn't it?

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.020
Well,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.240
like the stutterer driving a cart,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.639
who drove all the way to Moscow.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.400
I could say I've been to Moscow.

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.840
You've driven a cart?

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.560
I used to be a stutterer.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:38.379
This time,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.300
the Bolshoi Ballet is coming to China.

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:44.460
The Bolshoi...

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.439
Since I was little,

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.780
it's been my absolute favorite ballet company.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.479
It's such a rare opportunity.

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:54.639
I love them too. I'll go with you.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.500
The thing is, Boss Li,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.780
if you want to go,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.580
I'm afraid the tickets are sold out.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.280
Three days ago,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.419
I asked Wang Song

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:05.479
to buy tickets for me online.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.919
I don't know if he managed to get them.

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.319
He definitely got them.

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.120
Wang Song is absolutely reliable.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.080
I trust him completely.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.240
The other day,

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.240
he said he'd help me

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.780
clean up the junk files on my computer.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:18.439
We agreed

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:20.539
he'd bring it back today when he's done.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.780
Careful.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.280
Auntie Cai,

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.340
careful.

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.219
Why did you let go before it touched the ground?

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:30.080
It wasn't me.

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:31.599
It's fine.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.039
Later,

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.719
we can just change,

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:33.500
change the pot.

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.120
Wang Song,

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:38.599
about what I asked you to buy,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.199
the Bolshoi tickets,

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.620
what row and seat are they?

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.979
Getting tickets...

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:43.719
I forgot.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.520
Darn it.

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.080
There isn't a single one left.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.740
Wang Song,

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.620
I...

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.580
I told you three days ago!

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.340
I'm sorry, Ms. Liu.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.039
I've been a bit...

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:58.560
It's my fault.

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:00.500
Forget it. It's okay.

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:01.500
Well,

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.259
the cart won't make it to Moscow either.

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.219
My computer is okay, right?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.599
Your computer...

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.699
It's lost.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.860
What?

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.259
Didn't you take it

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:13.580
to clear the junk files?

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.939
Yes.

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:15.919
I forgot.

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.000
This kid...

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:28.139
Sounds great

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.459
Awesome

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.240
That was amazing

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:31.259
Thank you

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:33.040
I'll edit it tonight,

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.240
and post it to our community video account later.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.120
Let's see

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.220
Should be fine

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.120
Darn it

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.500
I forgot to press the record button

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.500
It didn't record

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:42.899
How could you do that?

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.540
This...

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.360
We did it for nothing

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.100
Hey, Wang Song

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:47.600
What's up with you these days?

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.600
You seem so distracted

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.120
No, I... well...

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.079
Auntie Cai thinks so too

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.660
You've been acting like you lost your soul lately

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.120
Wait, did you get dumped?

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.160
He needs a partner to get dumped

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:59.120
If he's single, what's there to lose?

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.920
It's not me

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:04.060
It's my mom and dad

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:04.839
What?

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:06.420
Your parents got dumped?

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.019
No, what are you talking about?

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:09.399
You don't call it a breakup for parents

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:10.480
That's called a divorce

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:12.959
Your parents are getting divorced?

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.319
I...

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:17.600
Why?

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:19.939
They just said

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.300
they don't want to be together anymore

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.600
Don't want to be together anymore?

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.279
That's the result, not the reason

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:25.500
The reason...

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.139
I don't know either

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:29.240
I'm not close with them

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.819
Not close?

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:32.259
Not close with your parents?

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:33.920
No...

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.980
No, wait

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:36.399
Listen to me

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.699
I went to boarding school in the county for middle school

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.500
Then boarding school in the city for high school

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:44.060
I worked during breaks to pay for tuition

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.939
I rarely went back home

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.079
And even if I did, I wouldn't see them

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:49.019
The two of them...

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.740
One does renovation work in Shenzhen

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.319
The other does cleaning in Chengdu

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:54.160
So we're just not close

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.740
That makes sense

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:58.939
If it were a long-distance relationship, it'd be over by now

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:14.199
What are you doing?

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.779
Why are you standing there like a statue?

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:17.660
Bro, cheer up a bit.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.360
It's just your parents getting divorced.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.560
Let them go ahead and divorce.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.259
To find new happiness.

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:24.079
What do you know?

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:26.100
My parents have been divorced for years.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.100
And I'm still not used to it.

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:29.439
I still dream about them getting back together.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.600
My folks divorced ages ago too.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.139
But I don't think it's a big deal.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.939
I still

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:35.920
grew up free and strong.

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:36.959
Well,

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.040
a complete family is still happier, right?

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.180
True, true.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.399
Some girls nowadays,

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:43.100
once they hear the guy's parents are divorced,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.740
they say,

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.800
this guy must have character flaws.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.000
And won't date him.

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:48.899
I think,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.639
no matter how happy the family,

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:52.300
parents will always have conflicts.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.240
At times like that,

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:55.579
the child should act as the glue holding them together.

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:57.019
That's why they say,

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:58.899
children are the shackles of marriage.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.040
It's a bond.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.779
Alright then.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.120
So Wang Song, you should think about it.

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:04.680
Is it possible that you, the bond,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.800
weren't tied tight enough?

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.500
No,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.939
he barely sees his parents all year.

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:10.019
How can he tie them tight?

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:11.180
I think

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.019
Wang Song should do something

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.439
to stop them from divorcing.

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:15.939
What can I do?

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.379
Whenever I try to persuade them,

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:18.740
they just yell over the phone,

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:20.120
"It was all for you..."

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.220
"...that we didn't divorce sooner."

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.339
"Now that you're grown up..."

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:23.120
"...we're done enduring it."

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.319
We're screwed.

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:27.259
The computer screen went black.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.959
Whose computer is this?

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:29.420
Quick, paper!

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.560
I'll go get the fire extinguisher.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.160
What's the use of a fire extinguisher?

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:36.180
This old song is still good.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:36.639
Yeah.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.339
What if we can't get the data back?

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.399
Then we're toast.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.959
Professor Fan is going to...

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:43.100
Enemy sighted.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.019
I'm retreating.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.720
You cover me.

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:45.240
What enemy?

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.240
Wang Song, what are you saying?

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:47.120
Wang Song.

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:49.019
Wang Song is here.

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:50.839
Uh, Professor Fan...

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.800
Are you busy?

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:52.939
What would I be busy with?

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:54.160
I can't even write my drafts.

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:55.279
I'm idle.

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:56.819
Is the computer fixed up?

00:07:57.259 --> 00:07:58.160
It can't be fixed.

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:00.100
Zhu Zhu, what are you saying?

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.620
It means your computer is toast.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.199
Zhu Zhu!

00:08:04.899 --> 00:08:05.899
You have such a big mouth.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.019
Isn't it all your fault?

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.220
For not tightening the bottle cap.

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:09.660
That was just an accident.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.180
Yes.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.639
So a drink was spilled on my computer?

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:13.519
It wasn't spilled.

00:08:13.579 --> 00:08:14.279
That's good then.

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:15.519
It was poured right onto it.

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:16.079
Ah!

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.240
It started smoking right then.

00:08:18.259 --> 00:08:19.319
My drafts!

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:20.740
They're all saved in there.

00:08:20.839 --> 00:08:22.279
My life's work!

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.680
Professor Fan, don't worry.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.120
I've already sent it for repairs.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:26.699
Right.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.579
Most likely...

00:08:27.579 --> 00:08:28.500
Very possibly...

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:29.639
Maybe...

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:30.759
It can be fixed.

00:08:31.019 --> 00:08:32.019
Maybe?

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.080
So there's still a chance it can't be fixed!

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.320
Wang Song.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.419
Aren't you usually the most reliable one?

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.120
Just because your parents are divorcing...

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.720
...it's hit you this hard?

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.159
Look at how much trouble you've caused these past two days.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:44.639
You kid...

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:46.379
Your mental resilience is too poor.

00:08:47.299 --> 00:08:47.980
Old Fan.

00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:49.879
You old geezer.

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:51.519
Your mental resilience isn't much better.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.399
Just a broken computer...

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:54.879
...and it's hit you this hard?

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:55.940
A broken computer?

00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:57.639
All my important data!

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.419
The kid's parents are about to divorce.

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:01.419
Isn't that a bigger deal than your thing?

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:02.580
Exactly.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.399
The kid is watching his family fall apart.

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:07.139
Anyone who runs into that kind of thing...

00:09:07.139 --> 00:09:08.360
...would lose their bearings.

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:11.940
Divorce doesn't necessarily mean the family is broken.

00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:13.259
The dad is still the dad.

00:09:13.259 --> 00:09:14.279
The mom is still the mom.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.460
That's not the same.

00:09:15.559 --> 00:09:16.580
Once they divorce...

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.899
...the dad isn't the dad anymore.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.360
He becomes an enemy.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.120
Why?

00:09:20.179 --> 00:09:22.340
I'm a living example right here.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.940
Originally, our family...

00:09:24.139 --> 00:09:25.840
...had three loved ones.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.000
Now we've become three enemies.

00:09:28.179 --> 00:09:29.000
They can't divorce.

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:30.659
I don't approve.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.039
If there's no love...

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.940
...they should separate.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.440
Give her freedom.

00:09:35.799 --> 00:09:36.940
You foreigner, you don't understand.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.179
If the family is broken...

00:09:38.259 --> 00:09:39.860
...what's the point of freedom?

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.519
You bachelors...

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.399
...simply aren't like us family people...

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:44.299
...who value relationships.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.220
You give up too easily.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.360
That's also why you're single.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.500
It's precisely because we cherish love...

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.960
...that we don't want to send love to its grave.

00:09:53.019 --> 00:09:54.059
Right, Ms. Liu?

00:09:55.299 --> 00:09:56.120
Ms. Liu

00:09:57.039 --> 00:09:58.059
What I said just now

00:09:58.059 --> 00:09:59.159
wasn't directed at you.

00:09:59.159 --> 00:10:00.440
You value relationships the most.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.299
That's true.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.059
We women, compared to men,

00:10:03.059 --> 00:10:04.039
just value relationships more.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:04.799
Divorce

00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:05.980
happens for just four reasons.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:06.600
Right?

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.580
Men have wandering hearts.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.519
Men have affairs.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.100
Men find mistresses.

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:13.360
The fourth one...

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.580
Men order takeout too?

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:14.940
Right.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:15.639
Get lost.

00:10:16.419 --> 00:10:18.240
So marriage is a couple's business,

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.600
but divorce is all us men's fault?

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:21.580
Your situation proves

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.159
Ms. Cai is right.

00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:23.740
You shut up.

00:10:23.779 --> 00:10:24.559
Don't bring me into this.

00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:25.259
You speak first.

00:10:25.259 --> 00:10:26.080
Tell me.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.419
Which couple

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.179
doesn't have the woman there

00:10:29.259 --> 00:10:30.299
mending and sewing,

00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:31.500
washing and scrubbing,

00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:32.919
suffering hardships,

00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:34.039
working without complaint?

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.500
And you men?

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:36.919
You act like lords.

00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:38.259
All talk, no action.

00:10:38.379 --> 00:10:39.820
Fighting, domestic violence,

00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:41.299
and then having an affair.

00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:43.899
What do we women get from you?

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:45.480
So

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.320
you're suggesting

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:47.220
a divorce?

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:47.620
That's right.

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:48.580
What do you mean "right"?

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:50.559
You can't divorce. You can't.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.539
But you can't force love.

00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:53.379
There's a bond between husband and wife.

00:10:53.379 --> 00:10:54.779
If I want a divorce, no one can stop me.

00:10:55.659 --> 00:10:56.039
But

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.600
look at this mess with your parents.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.379
It's got them all worked up.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.919
Women abuse men too.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.019
How can it be like that?

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:14.299
Don't... don't pull me.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.799
Why are you pushing me?

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.419
No...

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.259
I'm not pushing you.

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:18.000
I'm pulling you back.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.120
You can't do something foolish.

00:11:19.159 --> 00:11:20.320
Why would I do something foolish?

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.840
Besides, even if I did,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.059
I wouldn't jump in the river.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.240
I was on the school swim team.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:25.940
You know?

00:11:26.299 --> 00:11:27.100
That's true.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.419
Then what are you doing standing here at night?

00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:31.080
None of your business.

00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:32.419
Can't I recite English?

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:35.720
But who recites English at night?

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.720
You have to do it in the morning.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.600
To remember it better.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.899
Why do you keep following me?

00:11:52.039 --> 00:11:53.000
Afraid something might happen to you.

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:55.019
Like stuffing myself to death at breakfast?

00:11:55.879 --> 00:11:56.539
Stay away from me.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:58.759
You're nobody to me.

00:11:58.759 --> 00:11:59.740
I'm doing this for your own good.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.000
My kindness is treated like dirt.

00:12:01.539 --> 00:12:02.879
You bite the hand that feeds you.

00:12:04.059 --> 00:12:04.620
Zhu Zhu

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.220
What's going on?

00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:07.480
Who bit the hand?

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.360
The donkey.

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:10.720
The donkey bit me.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:11.860
You two elders,

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.019
you be the judge.

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:14.820
He wanted to drown himself in the lake.

00:12:14.919 --> 00:12:16.360
I risked my life to save him.

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:17.639
Not only is he ungrateful,

00:12:17.639 --> 00:12:18.899
but I ended up getting hurt.

00:12:19.059 --> 00:12:20.700
If that's not biting the hand that feeds you, what is?

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.559
Who? Who wanted to drown themselves?

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.379
Are you saying...

00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:24.100
Wang Song?

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:25.360
You bet.

00:12:25.419 --> 00:12:26.460
If I had been one minute late,

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.779
that kid would have gone under.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:28.659
Look.

00:12:29.259 --> 00:12:30.159
Look at you, Professor Fan.

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:33.200
If you hadn't scolded him like that yesterday,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.259
would the kid try to drown himself?

00:12:36.179 --> 00:12:36.799
This...

00:12:37.059 --> 00:12:38.179
Can you blame this on me?

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.039
He's just taking things hard.

00:12:40.279 --> 00:12:41.360
That's also because...

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.000
his parents are getting a divorce.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.860
Parents divorcing is one thing.

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:46.240
On the other hand,

00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:47.860
you didn't exactly help matters.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:50.580
Help matters?

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.220
Help matters.

00:12:58.379 --> 00:12:59.019
Wang Song.

00:13:01.019 --> 00:13:02.600
Son.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.179
Dad.

00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:05.139
Mom.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.120
Why are you two here?

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.179
Didn't you send a WeChat message...

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.460
asking us...

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.240
to come tour Beijing?

00:13:12.539 --> 00:13:14.419
When did I invite you two...

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:16.039
to come travel in Beijing?

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:18.799
This was my brilliant move.

00:13:19.879 --> 00:13:21.179
It was clearly my idea.

00:13:21.659 --> 00:13:22.879
Using your WeChat...

00:13:23.019 --> 00:13:24.259
to message your parents...

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.500
and book tickets to Beijing.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.480
Since when did it become your brilliant move?

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.159
Together.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.220
A brilliant move by both of us.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.799
Zhu Zhu deserves credit too.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.039
Zhu Zhu.

00:13:33.419 --> 00:13:35.720
Wang Song, next time you pick up packages,

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.220
remember to log out of WeChat on your computer.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.340
Luckily I was doing a good deed.

00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:40.879
If you had met a bad person...

00:13:40.879 --> 00:13:41.100
let me tell you.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.000
Did I ask you to do this good deed?

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.039
See, what did I tell you?

00:13:44.039 --> 00:13:45.039
Bite the hand that feeds you.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:45.659
You...

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.440
Wang Song.

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:48.779
Everyone means well.

00:13:49.139 --> 00:13:50.100
Your family...

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.320
lacks communication usually.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.779
We invited the two parties here...

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.840
to sit down and have a good talk.

00:13:56.259 --> 00:13:56.759
Okay.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:57.940
Dad.

00:13:58.759 --> 00:13:59.279
Mom.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.860
Then tell me,

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:02.799
why do you want a divorce?

00:14:08.379 --> 00:14:08.879
You say it.

00:14:10.299 --> 00:14:11.000
You say it.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.120
Why do I have to speak first?

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.899
You brought it up first.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.700
So of course you should speak first.

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:18.360
I...

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.860
I can't say it.

00:14:19.919 --> 00:14:21.879
If I say it, they'll laugh me to death.

00:14:21.879 --> 00:14:22.840
I'm not saying it.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.960
You won't say it?

00:14:25.659 --> 00:14:26.840
You won't say it?

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:27.860
Fine.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.820
I won't say it either.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:32.759
This...

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:33.559
Okay.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.919
If you won't say it,

00:14:36.039 --> 00:14:37.059
then I won't say it either.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.600
Neither of us will speak.

00:14:39.799 --> 00:14:40.759
Don't both stay silent.

00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:41.840
I'll speak.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.320
You guys... Xiao Cai...

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.419
Do you two know?

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:46.100
This child, Wang Song,

00:14:46.159 --> 00:14:47.620
because of your situation,

00:14:47.779 --> 00:14:49.820
has been worried sick.

00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:51.419
Can't eat, can't sleep.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.220
Otherwise,

00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:53.299
he wouldn't have... the Professor's...

00:14:53.299 --> 00:14:54.620
broken that computer.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:55.759
Do you know inside that computer,

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.159
were the Professor's life savings?

00:14:58.679 --> 00:14:59.139
Do you know?

00:14:59.139 --> 00:15:00.159
His life savings!

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:00.919
How much is that?

00:15:00.919 --> 00:15:01.700
How much money?

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.000
How much do we have to pay?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:03.519
This...

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.100
We can't afford it.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.159
What is this nonsense?

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:06.860
Don't...

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:07.580
Don't talk about this.

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:08.379
Don't get sidetracked.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.080
Back to the main topic.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.440
Why the divorce?

00:15:17.779 --> 00:15:18.720
Um, you two.

00:15:19.159 --> 00:15:20.419
Hard to bring it up, right?

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:21.940
How about this?

00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:22.940
Let's talk separately.

00:15:23.059 --> 00:15:23.620
Okay?

00:15:23.779 --> 00:15:24.279
Okay.

00:15:24.279 --> 00:15:24.759
Sure.

00:15:24.759 --> 00:15:25.320
I agree.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.259
Don't your legs get numb squatting like that?

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.799
There are chairs right here.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.100
Sit down, it's more comfortable.

00:15:31.799 --> 00:15:32.460
No need.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.200
No thanks.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.820
I'll squat.

00:15:35.139 --> 00:15:36.139
It's more comfortable.

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:39.120
Mr. Wang.

00:15:39.799 --> 00:15:42.019
Let's have a heart-to-heart talk.

00:15:43.139 --> 00:15:44.659
I'm a few years older than you.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.419
Whether in academics,

00:15:46.419 --> 00:15:47.600
experience, or perspective...

00:15:47.639 --> 00:15:48.879
Enough, Old Fan.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.240
You just love to brag.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.279
What we're dealing with now is

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:53.840
Mr. Wang's marital issues.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.059
What experience do you have?

00:15:56.139 --> 00:15:57.240
Let me handle this.

00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:58.059
I...

00:15:58.399 --> 00:15:59.220
have been married a long time.

00:15:59.299 --> 00:16:00.039
I've seen a lot.

00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:01.299
I've been a leader for years.

00:16:01.299 --> 00:16:03.240
I excel at doing ideological work.

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:04.500
Enough, Old Li.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.179
You brag even more than I do.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.899
You're good at ideological work?

00:16:08.659 --> 00:16:09.820
How many couples have you reconciled?

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.440
I...

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.360
Of course, I haven't reconciled a single one.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.039
But I helped them raise their awareness.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.580
So they divorced happily and peacefully.

00:16:18.759 --> 00:16:19.759
See?

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.820
That's how marriage is.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:22.759
It's going to rain,

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:23.759
and mother will remarry.

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:25.299
Blindly persuading people to stay together

00:16:25.659 --> 00:16:26.799
is not the right approach.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.019
That's why I say you're cold-hearted.

00:16:29.019 --> 00:16:30.240
You've been a bachelor all your life.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.080
You can't stand seeing others happy.

00:16:32.419 --> 00:16:34.440
They clearly wanted to divorce on their own.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.659
How does that make me cold-hearted?

00:16:35.659 --> 00:16:36.500
You just are.

00:16:38.139 --> 00:16:38.639
You two...

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.600
My two brothers...

00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:40.299
Stop.

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:41.159
Just stop.

00:16:41.159 --> 00:16:41.740
You guys...

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.379
listen to me for a second.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.259
Let me say something.

00:16:44.259 --> 00:16:45.539
Okay.

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:48.419
Don't let my situation

00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:50.679
hurt your friendship.

00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:53.700
My wife...

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.679
insists on divorcing me.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.419
She insists that I have

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.340
someone on the side.

00:17:03.419 --> 00:17:05.019
He definitely has someone on the side.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.339
He and that woman

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.420
in Shenzhen

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.119
working at a construction site.

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:13.220
That woman

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:14.220
is named Xiao Cui.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:18.079
Xiao Cui.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.660
A bit like.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.039
When I found out about this,

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.099
I was so heartbroken.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.779
I really wanted to die.

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:31.920
But then I thought,

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.339
I really can't die.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.819
For the sake of my son,

00:17:34.819 --> 00:17:35.880
I have to live.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.079
No matter what,

00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:39.099
wait until my son finishes college,

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.440
then I'll divorce him.

00:17:40.839 --> 00:17:41.640
I must divorce him.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.319
I'm telling you,

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.180
I won't stay with him.

00:17:43.579 --> 00:17:44.000
You...

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:44.799
Xiao Cai.

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:46.599
Xiao Cai, don't be too impulsive.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.160
Listen to me.

00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:52.099
About your husband seeing someone on the side,

00:17:52.099 --> 00:17:53.140
is that confirmed?

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.019
Of course it's true.

00:17:55.019 --> 00:17:57.140
My older brother-in-law told me.

00:17:57.339 --> 00:17:57.859
Who?

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.259
My son's father's older brother.

00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:02.819
He couldn't stand watching it.

00:18:02.819 --> 00:18:03.960
He told me.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.700
Said they were at a construction site,

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.920
and the two of them just hooked up.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:09.839
It seems that...

00:18:10.019 --> 00:18:11.039
long-term separation

00:18:11.079 --> 00:18:12.359
regarding a couple's relationship

00:18:12.359 --> 00:18:14.000
indeed has an impact.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.140
Big Sister,

00:18:18.019 --> 00:18:19.880
you are so understanding.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.559
I see that you two

00:18:22.839 --> 00:18:24.359
are educated people, right?

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.380
Yes.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.519
We are all women.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.420
It's not easy for any of us.

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:34.839
So I'll just speak what's in my heart,

00:18:34.839 --> 00:18:36.599
and tell you everything.

00:18:37.279 --> 00:18:38.140
Speak.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.279
You should have said it sooner. Go ahead.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.539
My husband and I

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.599
met through a matchmaker.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.460
That's a good thing.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.359
We country folk don't have much romance.

00:18:51.559 --> 00:18:53.880
We just got married in a daze,

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.299
and had children.

00:18:56.759 --> 00:18:59.240
I envy you city people.

00:19:00.099 --> 00:19:02.140
You love each other,

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.480
and have that "soulmate" connection.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:06.940
I see what happened.

00:19:07.099 --> 00:19:09.299
The problem lies with that matchmaker.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.019
If you had met a cultured man like me back then...

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.160
Sis, do I count as a cultured person?

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.099
My sister says I do.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.740
If I had been your matchmaker,

00:19:18.779 --> 00:19:19.539
let me tell you,

00:19:19.619 --> 00:19:21.579
I guarantee you wouldn't have reached the point of divorce.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.920
In the blink of an eye,

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.019
over twenty years have passed.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.559
Oh, the long, slow years.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.759
I've never even tasted

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.660
the flavor of love.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.000
Well, you're quite cultured yourself.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.559
Right?

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:43.240
Speaking of which,

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.880
I've finally figured it out.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.279
I really can't take it anymore.

00:19:48.539 --> 00:19:49.160
Right?

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.640
I want to catch the tail end of my youth.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.880
I want to find my own happiness.

00:19:55.099 --> 00:19:56.140
Sister,

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.779
don't blame me for being blunt.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.180
For someone like you,

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.339
never mind the tail end of youth,

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.779
even the big toe of youth is gone.

00:20:06.259 --> 00:20:08.940
Happiness isn't that easy to find.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:09.980
I haven't even found it yet.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.079
With your conditions...

00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:11.680
let me tell you...

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.240
What Auntie Cai means is...

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.079
What Auntie Cai means is,

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.579
you've been married for over twenty years,

00:20:18.839 --> 00:20:20.579
so you should communicate more.

00:20:21.579 --> 00:20:23.900
We can't communicate!

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.680
As soon as you sleep,

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.579
as soon as you close your eyes,

00:20:26.579 --> 00:20:28.140
you think of your husband

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.519
being with another woman.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.380
It makes you want to vomit.

00:20:32.819 --> 00:20:34.319
How can you live like that?

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:35.740
You can't.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.319
The problem is, he hurt you.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.059
Right?

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.960
He hurt me,

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.480
you see?

00:20:41.539 --> 00:20:43.920
And he just laughs it off.

00:20:45.299 --> 00:20:49.819
My life has been nothing but suffering.

00:20:51.299 --> 00:20:56.779
Rain falls from the sky,

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:01.720
and my family produced a heartless man.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:03.460
That's right.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.319
Let me tell you, that's enough.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.160
What I hate most in this life is...

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.480
that heartless scoundrel.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.579
That ungrateful thing!

00:21:10.299 --> 00:21:12.299
Let me tell you, big sisters,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.980
I've lived such a wronged life.

00:21:16.839 --> 00:21:18.640
For these twenty-plus years,

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.559
for the Wang family,

00:21:21.259 --> 00:21:22.819
I served the old,

00:21:23.079 --> 00:21:24.680
birthed the young,

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.299
sewed the new,

00:21:27.799 --> 00:21:29.140
mended the old,

00:21:29.619 --> 00:21:31.220
cooked the porridge,

00:21:31.359 --> 00:21:33.279
and boiled the rice.

00:21:34.019 --> 00:21:35.480
And now,

00:21:36.119 --> 00:21:39.680
my husband has a woman on the side,

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:41.039
and my son...

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.960
he isn't even close to me.

00:21:44.359 --> 00:21:47.759
What is the point of me living?

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.299
Don't cry.

00:21:50.339 --> 00:21:52.119
Although I didn't quite catch what you said,

00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:54.680
for this kind of ungrateful scumbag,

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.339
we must strike him to the ground,

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.539
stomp on him ten thousand times,

00:21:57.599 --> 00:21:58.440
so that he may never

00:21:58.519 --> 00:21:59.319
get a wife again!

00:21:59.359 --> 00:21:59.759
Right!

00:21:59.759 --> 00:22:01.559
You shouldn't beat him to death with one stick.

00:22:01.559 --> 00:22:01.920
Right.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.740
Hit him with a few more sticks!

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:03.099
Hit him!

00:22:03.099 --> 00:22:04.140
No, you...

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.200
What I mean...

00:22:06.259 --> 00:22:07.720
What we mean is,

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.900
it's best if he can be educated and reformed.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:14.920
Where's the guy named Chen?

00:22:15.099 --> 00:22:15.640
No.

00:22:15.819 --> 00:22:16.759
That guy named Wang.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.200
Where is Wang Shimei?

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.079
Where did he go?

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.720
Little Cai, what are you doing?

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:22.440
Where is Wang Song's dad?

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:23.859
Did he flee to escape punishment?

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.920
No, he didn't flee.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.019
He's right here.

00:22:26.099 --> 00:22:26.579
Come here.

00:22:29.819 --> 00:22:30.940
Alright then.

00:22:31.059 --> 00:22:32.740
You heartless scoundrel named Wang.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.940
So you've got someone on the side, huh?

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.160
Tired of the old and want the new, right?

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.299
Found yourself a new flame, did you?

00:22:40.579 --> 00:22:41.980
You may look ugly,

00:22:42.299 --> 00:22:43.880
but you sure dream big.

00:22:44.119 --> 00:22:44.619
What?

00:22:45.119 --> 00:22:46.119
What new flame?

00:22:46.619 --> 00:22:46.980
I...

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.220
I don't have anyone on the side!

00:22:48.339 --> 00:22:49.839
You still won't admit it?

00:22:50.599 --> 00:22:52.619
You think I don't know anything, right?

00:22:52.759 --> 00:22:53.819
What do you know?

00:22:54.079 --> 00:22:55.000
Xiao Cui.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:56.920
No, you...

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.500
Speak up.

00:22:58.819 --> 00:23:00.359
Say it in front of everyone.

00:23:00.359 --> 00:23:01.519
Who is Xiao Cui?

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.019
How did you know?

00:23:03.099 --> 00:23:04.079
Brother-in-law.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.680
Your big brother told me.

00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:08.019
Are you...

00:23:08.259 --> 00:23:09.579
Is there something going on between you two?

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.119
You're talking nonsense.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.180
What is going on with you two?

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:13.660
You...

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:14.440
Shut up, you.

00:23:14.579 --> 00:23:15.519
Just stop talking.

00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:17.259
Stop slandering people.

00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:18.220
Framing an innocent man.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.079
Let me tell you.

00:23:19.079 --> 00:23:20.539
First, explain this clearly to me.

00:23:20.619 --> 00:23:21.839
What is your relationship with that person?

00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:22.880
That one called Xiao Cui.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.319
Let me tell you all.

00:23:26.539 --> 00:23:27.700
That woman...

00:23:27.819 --> 00:23:29.019
named Xiao Cui.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.900
It's absolutely true.

00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:32.460
She's at our construction site,

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.759
an older lady who cooks meals.

00:23:35.299 --> 00:23:36.640
She looks even older than you.

00:23:37.019 --> 00:23:37.920
Me and her...

00:23:38.339 --> 00:23:40.140
there's really nothing going on!

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.759
That's still your fault.

00:23:45.039 --> 00:23:45.759
How is it my fault?

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.319
Then how do you treat your wife?

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.220
You show no interest,

00:23:49.319 --> 00:23:49.980
no care,

00:23:50.039 --> 00:23:50.759
and pay her no attention.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.119
Is it your fault or not?

00:23:52.119 --> 00:23:52.779
Yes.

00:23:52.839 --> 00:23:54.259
Women need to be cherished.

00:23:54.539 --> 00:23:56.279
Wives must be coaxed.

00:23:57.119 --> 00:23:58.480
That's you guys.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.140
We are out all day long,

00:24:01.319 --> 00:24:02.000
working,

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.000
earning money,

00:24:03.099 --> 00:24:04.480
supporting the family.

00:24:05.099 --> 00:24:07.019
How can we be like you city folks,

00:24:07.259 --> 00:24:09.240
saying all those sweet words.

00:24:13.259 --> 00:24:14.079
Grandpas, Grandmas,

00:24:15.359 --> 00:24:16.319
brothers and sisters,

00:24:17.579 --> 00:24:18.680
thank you for your trouble.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.339
Thanks for caring.

00:24:22.059 --> 00:24:23.279
Let me talk to them.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:29.779
Dad

00:24:31.079 --> 00:24:31.680
Mom

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.259
Let's drink this

00:24:36.859 --> 00:24:37.759
What needed to be said

00:24:38.259 --> 00:24:39.500
I've said it all

00:24:40.619 --> 00:24:42.799
If you still want to divorce

00:24:44.019 --> 00:24:45.859
your son wishes you happiness

00:24:50.019 --> 00:24:50.680
Divorce

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.160
or not?

00:24:57.519 --> 00:24:58.240
No divorce

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:01.619
No

00:25:01.619 --> 00:25:03.660
I'm not divorcing for the sake of my son

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.880
But tell me the truth

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.160
is there really something going on with that woman?

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.279
She and I are

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.259
there's really nothing going on

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:14.920
And you?

00:25:17.779 --> 00:25:19.059
You and my boss

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.019
did you have a fling?

00:25:21.579 --> 00:25:22.720
What are you saying?

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.339
That's a horrible thing to say

00:25:27.619 --> 00:25:28.579
Mom

00:25:30.319 --> 00:25:31.559
It's great you're not divorcing

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.819
But even if you don't divorce

00:25:34.259 --> 00:25:35.160
our family

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.420
needs to make some changes

00:25:37.759 --> 00:25:38.880
Starting with me

00:25:39.119 --> 00:25:40.140
Start what?

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.960
Start communicating

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.039
Start talking

00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:45.140
Start caring for each other

00:25:45.259 --> 00:25:47.940
Saying "I love you"

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.059
Our family

00:25:52.059 --> 00:25:53.160
the three of us

00:25:53.619 --> 00:25:54.779
it's really sad

00:25:55.559 --> 00:25:57.720
Three people in three places

00:25:59.759 --> 00:26:01.220
Son, you don't know

00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:03.380
your dad and I

00:26:03.559 --> 00:26:04.599
out there

00:26:05.359 --> 00:26:08.140
working day and night

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.940
I just wanted to earn more money

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.039
to put you through college

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:15.299
You must make something of yourself

00:26:15.299 --> 00:26:16.440
You know?

00:26:17.299 --> 00:26:18.200
I know

00:26:20.259 --> 00:26:21.519
I'm graduating soon too

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.799
You won't need to support me anymore

00:26:24.559 --> 00:26:25.519
On the contrary

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.579
I'll go to work

00:26:27.799 --> 00:26:28.619
work overtime

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:29.759
take part-time jobs

00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:31.460
for our family

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.559
for you guys

00:26:32.819 --> 00:26:33.619
to make you proud

00:26:34.519 --> 00:26:35.140
Good

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:36.539
I

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.160
I'm not working in Shenzhen anymore

00:26:40.259 --> 00:26:41.559
I'm going back to our hometown

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.900
Didn't you say my cooking was good?

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.460
The two of us

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.500
we'll open a home-style restaurant

00:26:52.099 --> 00:26:52.619
Right

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.559
Your mom's home-style cooking

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.900
is delicious

00:26:56.339 --> 00:26:58.299
We'll open a home-style restaurant

00:26:58.579 --> 00:27:01.059
A second venture

00:27:02.119 --> 00:27:04.680
You've never even had a first venture

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.940
Let me tell you

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:09.519
when our son makes money later

00:27:10.059 --> 00:27:11.019
you two

00:27:11.319 --> 00:27:14.059
just stay home and enjoy life

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.900
Your dad and I aren't going anywhere

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.619
The three of us will be together every day

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.140
Come on

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:23.019
Cheers

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:23.740
Cheers
