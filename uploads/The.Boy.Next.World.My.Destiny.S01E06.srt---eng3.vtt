00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.220
You're Fu Yotsuba, right?

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.000
His mother wants to know

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.280
how much money it'll take

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.540
for you to get out of her son's life.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.530
If it's that much money,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.880
I suggest you just donate it.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.710
Ugh.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.630
What's wrong with this family...?

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.940
Hey.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.320
How's it going?

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.040
Hello...?

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.530
Hey, Sara.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.870
How many years have we been friends?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.120
Who knows.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.530
We've been best friends for years, but
I still have no idea what you're thinking.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.050
Sara.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.050
Sara.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.470
Sara.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.080
Fu and I are together.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.110
Since when?

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.050
Since I saw it in my dreams.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.920
I knew it.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.970
Taiga.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.760
Imagine you liked someone so much

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.920
that you even dreamed about them.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.400
And in those dreams, you'd
been dating since high school.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.910
What would you do?

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.370
That kind of dream talk...

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.630
I'd forget it the second I woke up.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.440
I tried to do that too.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.070
You're just confusing your
dreams with your real memories.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.850
If it's a side effect
of the accident, fine.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.860
But you're back to normal now.

00:01:59.113 --> 00:02:01.153
You need to draw a line
between dreams and reality.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.039
Besides, Fu never had those dreams.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.240
Why on earth does he believe
you enough to be with you?

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.040
A parallel world.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.620
Huh?

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.350
There's a parallel world
where Fu and I are lovers.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.510
He believes that's where I'm from.

00:02:26.143 --> 00:02:27.643
That's impossible. It's ridiculous.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.610
Sara?

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.500
Here.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.760
Taiga.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.560
Wait, what?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.040
Why?!

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.910
- What's going on?
- Hmm?

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.140
- It's getting a bit loud.
- Never mind, let's go.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.500
Himeka's play...

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.500
Fumi said she wanted to go together.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.080
We're really looking forward to it.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.770
See ya.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.500
The Boy Next World My Destiny
(Episode 6)

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.546
Soshi, what are you doing here?

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.880
Mom's already making her move.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.240
- Dad's worried too.
- What about Fu?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.080
Sara.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.680
Fu is fine.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.580
Anyway, let's just go inside first.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.390
I'm coming in too.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.590
Fu.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.100
Are you okay?

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.650
What did they do to you?

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.460
Mom sent someone over.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.279
They asked how much money he wanted

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.850
to leave my brother's side.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.050
That sounds just like her.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.880
It looks like Fu will be
a target from now on.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.980
The more my brother cares
for him, the worse it'll get.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.390
But why?

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.190
She's his mother...

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.090
That's exactly why.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.510
She treats her children
like property to be controlled.

00:05:02.205 --> 00:05:03.425
Anyone she sees as an obstacle

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.770
must be taken away and destroyed.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.110
That's not normal.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.829
But that's the reason

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.360
these brothers haven't been able
to live together all these years.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.330
Brother.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.230
About that...

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.230
Can we tell him?

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.310
I'm fine.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.790
Please, tell me.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.330
Before the divorce,

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.529
Mom treated everything
Dad owned as her own.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.810
She stripped him of his freedom.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.360
Dad put up with it for a long time.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.670
But then something happened...

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.230
and that monster became even more vicious.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.860
Sara's grades

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.480
have been outstanding.
He's been top of his class all year.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.050
In Japanese, Math, Science, and English...

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.419
he got perfect scores in all four subjects.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.150
He got a 98 in Social Studies.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.040
He only lost two points.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.600
Sara said the exact same thing.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.620
For today's home visit,

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.900
what I wanted to ask you, ma'am,

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.730
is to please acknowledge
his hard work a bit more.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:31.790
Excuse me.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.489
It looks like the teacher is leaving.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.490
Huh...?

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.150
I'll see you out.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:47.790
Thank you for having me.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:53.980
Hello, sir.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.010
- Sorry to intrude.
- Good work today.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.350
Take care, and thank you.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.460
- Goodbye.
- Mai.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:11.470
Get home safely, okay?

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.280
You...

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.700
How dare you throw yourself
at a student's father?

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.310
Hey, are you out of your mind?

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.690
Wait... what do you mean?

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.000
Everyone, listen to this!

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.230
It's all her fault.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.489
This woman is absolutely shameless. I...

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:26.870
Who are you...?!

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.960
Hello, teacher.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.280
Mrs. Kogami?

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.130
An educator on the surface,

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.870
but making eyes at someone
else's husband behind their back.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.880
Shameless.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.070
Is it money you're after?

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:49.990
No... ah...

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.780
You must be mistaken.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.230
I would never do anything
to betray my students.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.350
Ah!

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.140
My hand hurts!

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.210
You've got a lot of nerve.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.890
Please believe me.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.950
I really didn't do anything.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.250
It hurts...!

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.710
Hey, get up.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.260
Look me in the eye.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.200
Now, give me a smile.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.700
Just like the one you gave my husband.

00:08:21.243 --> 00:08:21.993
No...

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.310
Mrs... Kogami...

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.620
How dare you say my name?!

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.160
I'm going to show you

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.550
a hell that's fitting for someone like you.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.510
She spread lies where there was no truth.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.640
She burned down a life
someone worked so hard to build

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.200
in the blink of an eye.

00:09:01.225 --> 00:09:03.705
[A stream of comments basically
telling the teacher she's shit]

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.450
By the time Sara and his dad found out,

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.820
that teacher

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.410
had already taken her own life.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.720
When Dad asked for a divorce, she lost it.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.360
After putting us through hell,

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.660
she said if he wanted a divorce,
he had to leave one son behind.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.140
So...

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.030
Your father left Sara behind...?

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.150
It was the right choice.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.280
Because Soshi was younger than me.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.160
But being older doesn't
mean you're stronger.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.760
Sara was only in
elementary school then, right?

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.230
She never saw Sara as a son.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:56.220
Only as a tool for revenge
and a way to show off her power.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.400
The proof is that she forced
him to sign a terrible contract.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:02.630
A contract?

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.360
He got his freedom during college

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.760
in exchange for the rest of his life.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.800
It means that after graduation,

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.660
he'll be under her thumb forever.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.660
That's insane.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.800
But

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.530
that's our mother.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.760
No matter where you run, she'll find you.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.620
So I thought,

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.830
I might as well just
stay in the cage forever.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.840
No.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.260
I won't allow it.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.320
Your life

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.340
belongs to you, and no one else.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.680
My dad always said

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.700
my life is mine to live.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.220
Don't let sadness trap you.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.400
You too, Sara.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.630
You can't give up on being happy.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:29.770
Fu.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:34.490
The way I feel now...

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.080
is a little different than before.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.460
Huh...?

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.150
I didn't think I had a future

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.020
before I met you.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:59.580
But now,

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.530
I want this to keep going.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.890
Even if it's just for one more day.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.300
Even if it means standing up to Mom...?

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.960
Okay.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.340
Well said.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:37.760
That's my best friend.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.600
If we're going to do this,

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.290
why not go all the way?

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:44.570
Huh?

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.640
Fight back and make that monster suffer.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.780
We're not kids anymore.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:50.950
Times have changed.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.960
We can't let her get
away with this anymore.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.530
Then... what if my brother and Fu

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.819
moved in together as part of the plan?

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.840
Move in together?!

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.689
She hates them even dating.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.220
So moving in together...

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.350
wouldn't that be the ultimate provocation?

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.500
Spoken like Sara's brother.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.420
Let's do it.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.000
I know this will only
make her watch us closer.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.430
But I'm not afraid.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.050
Actually, I'm pretty pissed off right now.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:20.080
Fu.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.480
There's no stopping me.

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:31.530
Brother.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.900
I...

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.070
Instead of handing you over to that woman,

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.260
it's better if I'm the
one who deals with her.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.550
Goodbye.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:57.110
This time,

00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.800
it's my turn.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.700
Pick out some pajamas you like.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.510
Are you really planning to live with me?

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.790
I said I'm staying, so I'm staying.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:11.940
It's part of the plan.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:15.190
You're like a child.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.740
Don't blame me if I make a move on you.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.630
You're all talk.
You wouldn't actually do anything.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.560
Oh yeah? What about last time?

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:32.930
That was...

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.700
because you were taking care of me.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.650
But our "characters" are lovers now.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.050
Things might go a lot further than that.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:50.370
Right?

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.320
Wait.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:11.710
Sara.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.720
Scared?

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.460
What?

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:43.390
Is that all it takes?

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.030
Go ahead.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:56.020
Do whatever you want.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.830
Kid.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.760
Don't cry when you lose your "first time."

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.530
I don't know.

00:16:27.592 --> 00:16:29.192
It might hurt so much I actually do cry.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.550
I'm sleeping on the couch.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.050
You're too soft to even flick my forehead.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.240
You won't do a thing, Sara.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.800
Knock, knock, knock.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:38.670
I'm here.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.390
When did you take that
down from the balcony?

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.910
Since we're living together,
we don't need it anymore.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:57.630
I can't sleep.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.030

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.170
There's a good boy.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:24.980
Can you sleep now?

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.220
Yeah, Sara.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.310
There's a good boy.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.560
Dammit.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.170
What is going on here?

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.920
My precious little Fu is actually...

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:05.240
- Is it good?
- Hey, that's our Fu!

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:06.700
Ow!

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:08.940
- Shut up. Have you lost your mind?
- Yeah, I have.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.480
Look at this.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.510
Fu is the talk of the whole school now.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.200
I mean, his boyfriend is that aloof hottie.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.910
Sara is the one person I can't handle.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.030
Wait, why?

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.720
Don't go digging for details.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:23.310
Hey, Naruka?

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.440
Um, can I sit here?

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:28.490
Thanks.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.400
Hey.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:34.870
I have something to ask you, Fu.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.100
Are you guys really dating?

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:51.830
Yeah.

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:52.870
We're dating.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.300
Goddamn.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.320
- Did you have your "first time" already?
- Would you please shut up?

00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.640
Hey.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:01.930
I'm actually really happy right now.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.120
Why?

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.280
What do you mean, why?

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.590
Because you look happy, Fu.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.920
Right?

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:10.970
Yeah.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.060
Thank you.

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:20.570
I'm really happy, Sara.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.640
Even if...

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.980
we're only pretending to date for the plan.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:30.270
I'm still full of anxiety,

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.590
but Sara finally has some
hope. That's what matters.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.910
Whoa, I thought you were a ghost.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:42.670
Are you happy?

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.920
Huh?

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.250
Not because you saw a ghost,

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.620
but because you saw a person.
Does that make you happy?

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.020
Can you read minds or something?

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:55.010
Taiga.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.410
Do you want to go see a movie sometime?

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:00.660
It's an indie film.

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:02.480
There are only two screenings.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.419
If you miss it, it's gone. It's
the kind of thing you'd like.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:06.540
How would you know that?

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.550
Is Sara using Fu to...

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.350
No, that's impossible.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.700
I'm Jin.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.809
Second-year Art major.

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:16.576
Sagittarius, Type AB.
My favorite color is gray...

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.600
Stop!

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:18.820
What are you doing?

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.720
I figured I should introduce myself.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.600
Also, the reason I'm asking you out

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.930
is because Fu got a boyfriend.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.590
Now I don't have anyone
to go to the movies with.

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.510
Well, that's too bad.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.250
Go find someone else.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.980
Do you want a ride?

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:39.670
Don't worry about it.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:41.660
I'm giving up for today.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.970
Does that mean... you'll ask me again?

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:51.840
Can you read minds too, Taiga?

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.510
Let's go.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:04.950
Can I ask you something?

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:07.340
Hmm? What is it?

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.980
If someone you really cared about

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.590
lied to you...

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:17.590
how would you feel?

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.540
Did you lie to me?

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.080
No.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.020
If someone important lied to me,

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.940
I think I'd be really hurt.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:31.980
But...

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.810
I'd ask them why they did it first

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.470
before I decided to get angry.

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.370
Fu?

00:23:45.371 --> 00:23:46.400
Fu!

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:52.630
Are you okay?

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:05.470
It's your fault for asking
such weird questions...

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.080
I'm sorry...

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:18.510
Fu.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.620
It's going to swell up.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Let go...

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:01.110
Do you feel any better?

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:06.350
I dreamed about my dad.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:08.770
What kind of dream?

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.640
I can't remember.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.116
Whenever the anniversary
of his death gets close,

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.340
I always have this dream.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.700
And when I wake up,

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:21.660
I can't stop crying.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.070
I feel so lonely.

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:27.070
But today is different.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.750
I'm sorry for snapping at you earlier.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.510
Thank you for being here with me.

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:08.170
Go to sleep, Fu.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:11.210
Why?

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:19.360
I... I don't think I can hold back anymore.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.100
If I leave now,

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:36.620
will you go back to your room?

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.830
- Fu...
- Let me help you.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:01.010
Fu...

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.100
I warned you.

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:22.610
You helped me before.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:24.380
This time, let me...

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.330
Teach me what to do.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:32.710
Is that okay?

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:01.310
I'm sorry.

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:04.810
Keep going...

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.400
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have taken
advantage of you while you were crying.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.260
It wasn't like that.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.170
I'm the one who started it.

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:41.110
Think of it as payback for last time.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:44.190
That was different.

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:46.650
I did that because I wanted to.

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:48.450
So did I.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:58.530
Besides, you're not actually
going to do anything, right?

00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.720
In that case,

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:01.090
sleep here with me tonight.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.870
Please? Just stay.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.640
If that's what you want,

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.500
I'll stay right here.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.720
Goodnight.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.480
Hey.

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:54.630
Is that you, ma'am?

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:56.740
It's been a long time.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:00.300
How has Sara been doing?

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:44.300
I'll be going now.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:50.370
Wait, here's my contact info.

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:52.310
I don't need it.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:56.490
If someone gives you a ride home, shouldn't
you at least have a way to say thanks?

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:58.060
This little brat.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.620
This little brat.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.240
What are you laughing at?

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:05.940
You're such an honest person.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:21.510
I just hate owing people favors.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:24.380
That's good.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:31.620
Get home safe.
