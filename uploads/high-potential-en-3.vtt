Thanks to my colleague here,
we're pretty certain that

00:11:54.575 --> 00:11:56.744
you weren't involved in
the attack on Mr. Gould.

00:11:56.827 --> 00:11:58.454
At least not the one this morning.

00:11:58.537 --> 00:12:01.207
Yes, see,
when we found that empty syringe on Marco,

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:05.044
we realized he was going to inject
an air bubble into Nathan's bloodstream.

00:12:05.127 --> 00:12:08.130
So if Marco went
there to kill Nathan then,

00:12:08.214 --> 00:12:11.634
that means you and your guys
didn't attack Nathan earlier.

00:12:11.717 --> 00:12:13.010
Ain't that ironic? Hmm?

00:12:13.093 --> 00:12:17.223

-[chuckles]

But that makes me wonder.

00:12:23.187 --> 00:12:26.816
Why did you send Marco
with just an empty syringe?

00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:29.860
I mean, injecting an air bubble
into someone's bloodstream,

00:12:29.944 --> 00:12:32.822
that would make their death
look like natural causes, right?

00:12:32.905 --> 00:12:36.408
But someone like you,
in the reputation business,

00:12:36.492 --> 00:12:38.577
would want Nathan's death
to send a message.

00:12:39.119 --> 00:12:44.083
Unless you had a way
to profit off of Nathan's death,

00:12:44.166 --> 00:12:47.878
but only if it looked
like you didn't kill him.

00:12:48.587 --> 00:12:51.590
185004606.
Does that number sound familiar?

00:12:53.801 --> 00:12:56.470
It does. It did sound familiar.
Do you see that?

00:12:56.554 --> 00:12:59.473
That number we saw at Nathan's,
that was Ray's Social Security number.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.894
<i>You see,</i>
<i>before the current randomized system,</i>

00:13:03.978 --> 00:13:06.230

<i>where the applicant lived,</i>

Now, I can roughly guess your age,
you know,

00:13:15.155 --> 00:13:17.950

hard living put on you.

00:13:18.033 --> 00:13:21.328
And thanks to that photo over there
of you marching in the Mummers parade,

00:13:21.412 --> 00:13:24.790
which is an annual Philly thing,
I'm guessing you're from Pennsylvania.

00:13:24.874 --> 00:13:27.293
Both of those make sense
with the number that we found.

00:13:27.376 --> 00:13:29.336
But that begs the question.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:33.424
Why would Nathan Gould have
his loan shark's Social Security number?

00:13:33.507 --> 00:13:36.802
But you hate talking to cops,
so I'll answer this one for you.

00:13:36.886 --> 00:13:40.180
You need someone's Social Security number,
and in many cases a notary,

00:13:40.264 --> 00:13:42.016
<i>which would explain the ink smudge,</i>

00:13:42.099 --> 00:13:45.561
to make them
the beneficiary of your life insurance.

00:13:46.228 --> 00:13:50.232
So, in other words, Ray, you forced
Nathan Gould to make you the beneficiary

00:13:50.316 --> 00:13:53.402
on his insurance policy as
a way to pay off his loans.

00:13:53.485 --> 00:13:54.987
And then because you
love to stack the deck,

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.072
you sent Marco to make sure you collect.

00:13:57.156 --> 00:14:00.159
I didn't force Nathan to do anything.
It was his idea.

00:14:00.242 --> 00:14:02.703
Really? Care to elaborate?

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.832
I'm not getting the sense that he does.

00:14:06.916 --> 00:14:09.543
Mmm. Well, we wanna know who else
is mad enough to kill Nathan,

00:14:09.627 --> 00:14:12.087
we need to find out whose name
he took off the life insurance.

00:14:12.796 --> 00:14:13.923
See you, Ray.

00:14:20.012 --> 00:14:24.850
Jessica, this is the old beneficiary form
from your father's life insurance policy.

00:14:24.934 --> 00:14:26.727
We had the insurance company
pull it for us.

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:30.356
Until a few weeks ago, you were in line
to collect $100,000 when your dad died.

00:14:30.439 --> 00:14:33.025
It made us wonder how you felt
about it when he changed the form.

00:14:33.108 --> 00:14:36.987
This is the first I'm hearing
my dad even had a life insurance policy,

00:14:37.071 --> 00:14:38.572
much less that my name was on it.

00:14:38.656 --> 00:14:40.741
Honestly, I'm surprised.

00:14:40.824 --> 00:14:42.534
He wasn't exactly good with money.

00:14:42.618 --> 00:14:44.620

00:14:44.703 --> 00:14:47.206
He and my mom split
when I was eight… [exhales]

mostly. I think.

with my dad over the years,

but he never followed through.

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:06.350
Till a couple of months ago
he reached out, out of the blue.

00:15:06.433 --> 00:15:10.604
He said he was going away soon, and he
wanted to make things right before he did.

00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:15.484
We've seen each other more in the last
couple of months than we have in decades.

00:15:16.527 --> 00:15:21.115

was carrying a pin on him in a gift box.

00:15:21.198 --> 00:15:23.492
It was a ladybug.
Does that mean anything to you?

00:15:25.744 --> 00:15:27.162
Oh. [voice cracks] Um…

00:15:28.956 --> 00:15:32.835

Well, Nathan and his daughter
were estranged for most of her life.

00:16:30.809 --> 00:16:34.313
He'd reached out recently and reconciled.
They were supposed to meet this morning,

00:16:34.396 --> 00:16:36.857
but for some reason
they ended up at two different cafés.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.233
We're still figuring that out.

00:16:38.317 --> 00:16:41.779
One thing she mentioned, he told her
he was planning to go away for a while.

00:16:41.862 --> 00:16:44.323
So did he book any
airline tickets or hotel rooms

00:16:44.406 --> 00:16:45.866
that would let us know where he was going?

00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:48.118
I've been going through
his credit card and bank statements.

00:16:48.202 --> 00:16:49.703
I haven't seen
anything about travel plans.

00:16:53.457 --> 00:16:55.000
Well, this is weird.

00:16:55.084 --> 00:16:58.837
He had a subscription for a specialty
dog food that he canceled a few weeks ago.

00:16:58.921 --> 00:17:01.215
We were just at his place.
Did you see any signs of a dog?

00:17:01.298 --> 00:17:02.633
I did not.

00:17:03.258 --> 00:17:05.177
I mean, I guess it's possible the dog
could have died,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.138
but what if he gave it away?
That would make a lot more sense.

00:17:08.222 --> 00:17:09.598
Go on.

00:17:09.681 --> 00:17:11.892
Well, Nathan recently
reconciled with his daughter,

00:17:11.975 --> 00:17:14.436
who he hasn't had
any contact with for years.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.190
He settles his debts with a loan shark
by signing over his life insurance, right?

00:17:18.273 --> 00:17:20.734
And then he tells his daughter
he's going away,

00:17:20.818 --> 00:17:22.820
despite there being no evidence of travel.

00:17:23.737 --> 00:17:25.322
Put that together with
giving your dog away,

00:17:25.405 --> 00:17:27.950
and I think this man was
planning on taking his own life.

00:17:28.033 --> 00:17:30.160
That's what he meant by
going away for a while.

00:17:30.786 --> 00:17:34.289
So somebody decides to kill the guy right
when he's about to kill himself.

00:17:34.373 --> 00:17:35.791
But why?

00:17:43.763 --> 00:17:45.848
-They didn't have any stevia.
-That's fine.

00:17:45.932 --> 00:17:48.017
-Or oat milk.
-Less fine.

00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:50.019
And I didn't think you'd want their decaf.
So…

00:17:53.064 --> 00:17:54.399
So you went with hot water.

00:17:55.316 --> 00:17:56.317
What a treat.

00:17:58.361 --> 00:18:00.196
This is the hospital's
transplant coordinator.

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:01.781
They're discussing organ donations.

00:18:02.407 --> 00:18:05.118
-So he's officially brain dead?
-Yeah.

00:18:07.912 --> 00:18:10.123
[sighs] Some timing, huh?

00:18:10.206 --> 00:18:13.584
This poor woman
finally reconciles with her father.

00:18:16.045 --> 00:18:17.630
You okay?

00:18:17.714 --> 00:18:21.259
You just, I don't know,
seem a little quiet for you.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.512
Ava asked if there was
any news about her dad.

00:18:24.595 --> 00:18:26.431
You haven't told her
about Arthur yet, huh?

00:18:27.056 --> 00:18:28.224
-No.
-Hmm.

00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:31.269
Well, even I've heard her say she
wants you to treat her like a grown-up.

00:18:31.352 --> 00:18:32.729
Maybe take her at her word.

00:18:41.362 --> 00:18:44.490
[sighs] You think he was going
to take his own life?

00:18:45.366 --> 00:18:46.743
You didn't know?

00:18:48.286 --> 00:18:49.287
Oh.

00:18:50.288 --> 00:18:52.957
Emmett. His dog.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.127
Dad asked me to take care
of him while he traveled.

00:18:56.794 --> 00:18:58.921
But why did he wanna die?

00:18:59.005 --> 00:19:02.592
It's just a theory right now, but we think
he actually may have been protecting you.

00:19:02.675 --> 00:19:05.803
Your dad owed money to some loan sharks.
They would have kept hurting him.

00:19:05.887 --> 00:19:07.555
Eventually, probably a lot worse.

00:19:07.638 --> 00:19:09.348
Knowing how these people operate,
we think that

00:19:09.432 --> 00:19:10.933
maybe they threatened
to come after you next.

00:19:11.017 --> 00:19:14.896
So by changing his life insurance policy,
and offering to end his own life,

00:19:14.979 --> 00:19:17.190
we think he was making sure you
didn't end up paying for his sins.

00:19:17.273 --> 00:19:20.443
Yeah. Was your dad close with anyone
he would have talked to about this?

00:19:21.778 --> 00:19:25.448
I… We had barely gotten to
know each other again.

00:19:25.531 --> 00:19:29.577
I just…
I don't know enough about his life to say.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.579
Did your dad know you were pregnant?

00:19:33.831 --> 00:19:35.082
How did you know?

00:19:35.166 --> 00:19:37.001
Well, the smells in here
are driving you nuts.

00:19:37.084 --> 00:19:40.379
I see that saltine peeking out of
your purse, and you've got ginger tea.

00:19:40.463 --> 00:19:41.672
Been there a few times.

00:19:43.257 --> 00:19:44.675
Congratulations.

00:19:45.301 --> 00:19:47.136
[chuckles] Uh…

00:19:47.804 --> 00:19:50.056
I told him the last time
we saw each other.

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:54.811
And… [sighs] …he was so excited.

00:19:54.894 --> 00:19:58.272
We joked about how much fun it is
to have a ton of doctor visits.

00:19:59.232 --> 00:20:01.442
[smacks lips]
It was the one thing we bonded over.

00:20:01.526 --> 00:20:02.902
He told you about his injuries?

00:20:03.778 --> 00:20:05.279
Um, his injuries? No, no.

00:20:05.363 --> 00:20:08.115
Uh, the visits that he talked
about were to a cardiologist.

00:20:08.199 --> 00:20:11.494
He said he recently had
a whole series of scans and tests.

00:20:11.577 --> 00:20:13.204
[Karadec] Did he mention
any specific symptoms?

00:20:13.287 --> 00:20:16.123
[Jessica] No. If anything,
it was the opposite.

00:20:16.207 --> 00:20:20.419
He went out of his way to make sure
I knew that everything was fine.

00:20:20.503 --> 00:20:23.047
Why would someone who's fine put
themselves through a series of tests?

00:20:32.014 --> 00:20:34.141
Oh, we're like 20 minutes early.
I didn't even realize.

00:20:34.225 --> 00:20:36.936
I know. I'm so impressed.
I'm not sure how we pulled that off.

00:20:37.019 --> 00:20:38.104
[Elliot] I like this look on us.

00:20:38.187 --> 00:20:40.731
I can get some alone time in
the hydroponics lab before homeroom.

00:20:41.983 --> 00:20:43.943
-Bye, love you. [kisses]
-Bye, have a good day. [kisses]

00:20:44.026 --> 00:20:45.611
The joys of being a dweeb.

00:20:45.695 --> 00:20:48.072
I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do, but I'll manage.

00:20:48.155 --> 00:20:49.448
[door opens]

00:20:49.532 --> 00:20:50.867
Ava.

00:20:51.492 --> 00:20:52.827
Why don't you hang back for a second?

00:20:54.787 --> 00:20:56.581
I need to talk to you about something.

00:20:58.332 --> 00:21:02.503
So, at least as of a few weeks ago,
my dad was living in Nevada?

00:21:03.087 --> 00:21:04.589
According to this Arthur guy.

00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:08.009
Did he say how long
he was living there for?

00:21:08.092 --> 00:21:09.302
No.

00:21:10.553 --> 00:21:14.307
And all we know about
Arthur is that he's a landscaper?

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:15.558
I guess so.

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:19.103
I know it's not a lot of information
and we're gonna keep digging around.

00:21:19.186 --> 00:21:20.771
I didn't want to fill you in too early

00:21:20.855 --> 00:21:23.733
'cause I didn't want you to
get your hopes up or be let down.

00:21:24.317 --> 00:21:26.360
No, I-I want you to tell me everything.

00:21:26.444 --> 00:21:30.031
I know you do. I heard you, so
that's why I was filling you in on this.

00:21:30.615 --> 00:21:31.616
[phone buzzes]

00:21:34.368 --> 00:21:35.745
Ooh. I gotta go to work.

00:21:36.746 --> 00:21:38.748
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:41.208
Are you sure? 'Cause if not, I'll just
tell him I'm not coming in today.

00:21:41.292 --> 00:21:43.127
-No, no, no. Mom, it's okay.
-You're gonna play hooky--

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.295
I'm fine.

00:21:45.087 --> 00:21:47.506
-Okay. I love you.
-I love you.

00:21:52.803 --> 00:21:54.263
Can you find your way to school from here?

00:21:55.348 --> 00:21:57.266
Yeah, Mom, I'll plug it into Waze.

00:22:00.227 --> 00:22:02.313
[♪ somber music playing]

00:22:02.813 --> 00:22:04.190
[car engine starts]

00:22:16.452 --> 00:22:18.913
Hey. Daphne, you got Nathan Gould's phone?

00:22:18.996 --> 00:22:20.790
Yeah, TID unlocked it.

00:22:20.873 --> 00:22:22.833
Nathan got an email
the night before the attack,

00:22:22.917 --> 00:22:24.335
claiming to be from his daughter Jessica,

00:22:24.418 --> 00:22:26.879
changing their meeting to
7:45 at the café in Venice.

00:22:26.963 --> 00:22:28.589
Let me guess,
this is not Jessica's email address.

00:22:28.673 --> 00:22:30.007
I checked, it's a fake.

00:22:30.091 --> 00:22:31.634
Yeah, that would explain
why Nathan and Jessica

00:22:31.717 --> 00:22:33.094
ended up sitting at different cafés.

00:22:33.177 --> 00:22:35.721
Whoever did this wanted
Nathan at that café, and alone.

00:22:35.805 --> 00:22:37.974
[Oz] Since Nathan and Jessica had
just reconciled,

00:22:38.057 --> 00:22:41.060
he might not have even noticed the email
came from an unknown address.

00:22:41.143 --> 00:22:43.896
[quacks from phone]

00:22:44.939 --> 00:22:46.732
Uh, Morgan, what are you doing?

00:22:46.816 --> 00:22:49.777
There's an alarm set on
Nathan's phone for 8:01 a.m.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.196
and the ringtone is set to the duck sound.

00:22:53.406 --> 00:22:55.366
That's what the café
hostess heard in the alleyway.

00:22:56.075 --> 00:22:59.662
The killer wanted somebody to find
his body around 8 o'clock in the morning.

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:03.874
Long enough after the attack
to make sure he was brain-dead,

00:23:03.958 --> 00:23:06.293
but soon enough to make sure
his organs were still viable.

00:23:07.461 --> 00:23:10.589
I think Nathan Gould
was killed for his heart.

00:23:19.135 --> 00:23:21.179
Robbed again, call the cops.

00:23:22.097 --> 00:23:24.599
Good timing. Cops are here.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.435
[chuckles] Sorry, I-I didn't see you.

00:23:27.519 --> 00:23:29.396
You were saying
something about being robbed?

00:23:29.479 --> 00:23:31.022
He's kidding about calling the cops.

00:23:31.106 --> 00:23:33.733
People steal things off
the bus when we're on calls,

00:23:33.817 --> 00:23:36.236
even more so lately with
all the drug supply shortages.

00:23:36.319 --> 00:23:39.072
We just write it up,
but it's not the controlled stuff.

00:23:39.155 --> 00:23:40.615
That's locked up.

00:23:40.699 --> 00:23:44.661
-It's not the controlled stuff, right?
-Albuterol. An asthma med.

00:23:44.744 --> 00:23:46.121
We got more back at the house.

00:23:46.204 --> 00:23:47.706
Is there something we can help you with?

00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:50.208
We had some questions
about the Nathan Gould call.

00:23:50.292 --> 00:23:52.085
We're hoping you can walk
us through the timeline.

00:23:52.168 --> 00:23:53.878
Sure, shoot.

00:23:53.962 --> 00:23:57.340
Well, the 911 call came in around 8:01,
8:02. Is that about right?

00:23:57.424 --> 00:24:00.051
Yeah, sounds right. Just after our
shift started, which was at 8:00.

00:24:00.135 --> 00:24:02.387
And how long after that
for you to arrive on scene?

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.597
About five minutes. Café's close.

00:24:04.681 --> 00:24:08.351
And maybe another three minutes
after that to get a heartbeat back.

00:24:08.435 --> 00:24:10.729
One last question. It's a doozy.

00:24:11.438 --> 00:24:13.481
How long would a victim have to be down

00:24:13.565 --> 00:24:15.775
in order to guarantee
they'd be brain dead?

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.197
Eleven minutes, give or take.

00:24:23.616 --> 00:24:24.826
Appreciate it.

00:24:39.174 --> 00:24:40.842
-[message beeps]
-You were right.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.761
Course I was right.

00:24:42.844 --> 00:24:45.597
Also, you should think about
stocking up on albuterol if you need it.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.515
They're having a theft problem apparently.

00:24:47.599 --> 00:24:49.309
Think I'm all good there, but thank you.

00:24:49.809 --> 00:24:50.810
Where's Soto?

00:24:50.894 --> 00:24:53.063
She stayed back at
the hospital to ask a few more questions.

00:24:53.897 --> 00:24:57.067
This attack was timed to turn
Nathan Gould into the perfect organ donor.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.527
He was down for at least
11 minutes before help arrived.

00:24:59.611 --> 00:25:01.780
I've been thinking about it.
I think there's more.

00:25:01.863 --> 00:25:03.239
Nathan was in on it.

00:25:03.323 --> 00:25:06.034
The cardiac work-up. He was making
sure his heart was in good shape.

00:25:06.117 --> 00:25:08.286
Right. We already knew that
he was planning on killing himself.

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:10.497
Nathan had arranged with
someone to give them his heart.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.457
But then he found out he was
gonna become a grandfather,

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.834
and he changed his mind,
so the killer had to kill him.

00:25:14.918 --> 00:25:16.252
Unbelievable.

00:25:18.505 --> 00:25:19.714
-[sighs]
-Everything okay?

00:25:19.798 --> 00:25:21.257
Yeah.

00:25:21.341 --> 00:25:23.426
You're not gonna blast
the old-timey car horn, are you?

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:25.261
More than one novelty ringtone per case?

00:25:25.345 --> 00:25:27.180
I don't think so. That would be overkill.

00:25:27.263 --> 00:25:30.183
Fair enough, because it seems to be,
our next question is,

00:25:30.266 --> 00:25:34.104
"Who is Nathan Gould's heart going to?"
We find them, I think we find our killer.

00:25:39.109 --> 00:25:41.653
'Scuse me. Hi, I work with the police.

00:25:41.736 --> 00:25:43.863
I saw you talking
to Jessica Gould yesterday

00:25:43.947 --> 00:25:45.532
about her father's organ donations.

00:25:45.615 --> 00:25:47.492
-Yes, I remember you.
-Yeah.

00:25:47.575 --> 00:25:49.869
Has it been decided
where Nathan's heart's going yet?

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.124
I'm, uh, sorry, I wouldn't know.

00:25:54.749 --> 00:25:56.876
Aren't you
the hospital's transplant coordinator?

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.211
And you're on the committee, right?

00:25:58.294 --> 00:25:59.796
Yeah,
they call you guys "The God Committee."

00:25:59.879 --> 00:26:02.424
[Selena] You literally get to
decide who lives and who dies.

00:26:02.507 --> 00:26:05.051
If you can't answer our questions,
then who can?

00:26:05.135 --> 00:26:06.636
I…

00:26:06.719 --> 00:26:08.888
I meant I don't know
off the top of my head.

00:26:09.472 --> 00:26:12.308
Make an appointment with my office,
and I'll look it up for you.

00:26:12.934 --> 00:26:14.018
Okay?

00:26:16.271 --> 00:26:17.397
Any luck?

00:26:18.064 --> 00:26:20.650
I didn't realize the question about
where a donor heart was going was scary,

00:26:20.733 --> 00:26:22.110
but that woman seemed afraid to answer.

00:26:22.193 --> 00:26:23.445
Same deal with the transplant surgeon.

00:26:23.528 --> 00:26:25.280
I get the feeling these guys
are circling the wagons.

00:26:25.363 --> 00:26:27.532
As if someone with a lot of
pull is keeping them quiet.

00:26:27.615 --> 00:26:28.616
Mmm.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.827
Because maybe they want
the heart for themselves.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:33.163
One thing I did find out,
Jessica Gould has given her consent,

00:26:33.246 --> 00:26:35.373
so Nathan's set to be taken
off life support tomorrow.

00:26:35.457 --> 00:26:37.625
-Organs will be harvested then.
-Meaning if we're right,

00:26:37.709 --> 00:26:40.170
and someone is forcing the hospital
to give them the heart--

00:26:40.253 --> 00:26:42.630
-It'd be good to find out who first.
-[phone buzzes]

00:26:42.714 --> 00:26:43.840
Hello.

00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:46.551
W-What? Where is she?

00:26:47.969 --> 00:26:49.095
I'll be right there.

00:26:49.888 --> 00:26:51.556
Ava just got arrested.

00:26:52.557 --> 00:26:53.600
[sighs]

00:26:59.189 --> 00:27:00.482
[Karadec] U-Uh… [sighs]

00:27:02.942 --> 00:27:04.694
What the hell happened?

00:27:04.777 --> 00:27:06.112
Are you okay?

00:27:06.196 --> 00:27:07.489
You can uncuff her now, please.

00:27:07.572 --> 00:27:10.783
Can't do that. Building owner
caught her vandalizing his property.

00:27:11.493 --> 00:27:15.371
-Ava, it's one of your dad's murals.
-Yeah, I'm aware.

00:27:16.873 --> 00:27:20.210
-Oh, honey, I am so sorry.
-Just leave me alone, okay?

00:27:21.961 --> 00:27:24.631
[sighs] Okay. [clears throat]
So what happens now?

00:27:24.714 --> 00:27:25.840
We take her in.

00:27:25.924 --> 00:27:28.635
No, listen, that's not necessary,
all right?

00:27:28.718 --> 00:27:30.970
Her dad painted that.
This is a family matter.

00:27:31.054 --> 00:27:32.138
I will take care of it.

00:27:32.222 --> 00:27:34.933
Tell that to the owner.
Guy wants to press charges.

00:27:35.016 --> 00:27:37.393
That's the owner? How about this?
I go smooth it over with him,

00:27:37.477 --> 00:27:39.103
we assure him the young lady's
gonna come back,

00:27:39.187 --> 00:27:41.481
clean this mess up later,
and forget it ever happened.

00:27:41.564 --> 00:27:43.650
-No paperwork for you.
-[police officer] Sorry, Detective.

00:27:43.733 --> 00:27:45.485
If the girl really wanted
to clean this up,

00:27:45.568 --> 00:27:47.028
she had her chance before you got here.

00:27:47.111 --> 00:27:48.279
Come on, on your feet.

00:27:48.363 --> 00:27:50.740
-No, don't touch my daughter, okay?
-[Karadec] Morgan, it's all right.

00:27:50.823 --> 00:27:52.408
I know it's all right! I'm all right!

00:27:52.492 --> 00:27:54.369
-Ma'am!
-And don't call me ma'am. Okay, sir?

00:27:54.452 --> 00:27:56.412
Don't call me ma'am right now.
I don't need that from you.

00:27:56.496 --> 00:27:58.206
What I need from you is to understand

00:27:58.289 --> 00:28:00.750
that giving a 15-year-old girl
a criminal record

00:28:00.833 --> 00:28:03.127
over some paint is completely insane.

00:28:03.211 --> 00:28:05.630
Can we all agree on that?
I mean, it's paint!

00:28:16.099 --> 00:28:18.977
-Ava--
-Can we not here?

00:28:21.563 --> 00:28:23.356
-'Cause of her?
-[sighs]

00:28:23.439 --> 00:28:26.401
Ava, that woman has
her own problems to deal with.

00:28:28.486 --> 00:28:29.737
No offense.

00:28:30.613 --> 00:28:31.823
Yeah.

00:28:31.906 --> 00:28:34.325
-[Karadec] Thanks, Gina.
-[Gina] You got it.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.456
"Treat her like a grown-up," he said.

00:28:42.375 --> 00:28:43.626
You're welcome?

00:28:44.438 --> 00:28:46.357
[♪ somber music playing]

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:03.291
Hi.

00:29:06.168 --> 00:29:07.253
I'm sorry.

00:29:09.213 --> 00:29:11.048
Oh, buddy, come here.

00:29:11.716 --> 00:29:12.842
I'm sorry.

00:29:13.801 --> 00:29:15.052
I messed up.

00:29:15.136 --> 00:29:19.390
Sometimes I forget that there's a right
time to drop huge information on someone

00:29:19.473 --> 00:29:22.768
and a wrong time, which would be
right before you send her off to school.

00:29:25.605 --> 00:29:27.106
It wasn't that.

00:29:27.773 --> 00:29:32.069
I know I said I wanted to know everything,
but I was wrong.

00:29:32.153 --> 00:29:34.405
This is way worse than not knowing.

00:29:34.488 --> 00:29:35.656
What do you mean?

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:41.245
My dad's been alive this whole time
living his life one state over.

00:29:41.329 --> 00:29:44.457
And with everything you've
been finding out,

00:29:45.499 --> 00:29:50.463
I actually let myself believe he cared,
that he didn't abandon us.

00:29:50.546 --> 00:29:51.631
I still believe that.

00:29:51.714 --> 00:29:53.799
-How?
-Because I know who your dad was,

00:29:53.883 --> 00:29:56.552
and we haven't heard
his side of the story yet, you know?

00:29:56.636 --> 00:29:59.931
Maybe there's a reason
that he's had to stay away.

00:30:00.014 --> 00:30:01.432
My whole life?

00:30:01.515 --> 00:30:04.560
I can't for the life of me wrap
my mind around what that reason would be,

00:30:05.311 --> 00:30:06.646
but the one thing I do know,

00:30:06.729 --> 00:30:09.148
is that he loved you more than
anything in the whole world.

00:30:11.734 --> 00:30:12.735
Okay.

00:30:14.111 --> 00:30:16.072
You know,
I'm actually working on a case right now

00:30:16.155 --> 00:30:19.867
where this father is
estranged from his daughter,

00:30:19.951 --> 00:30:21.994
and once he came back into the picture,

00:30:22.078 --> 00:30:24.246
the only thing he cared
about was making it right.

00:30:26.207 --> 00:30:28.459
And that's what all this is about?

00:30:29.085 --> 00:30:30.086
[Morgan] It's part of it.

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:34.131
I'm looking for somebody
who needs a heart transplant.

00:30:34.882 --> 00:30:39.136
Somebody powerful enough to
intimidate an entire hospital to get it.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.473
So, I figured I'd start
with their biggest donors.

00:30:42.556 --> 00:30:44.433
-These guys.
-Mm-hmm.

00:30:44.517 --> 00:30:47.853
You are looking at
a who's who of LA philanthropy.

00:30:50.398 --> 00:30:51.399
What about him?

00:30:52.483 --> 00:30:55.027
Carson Wood.
Looks like he's a big producer.

00:30:55.736 --> 00:30:58.698
This photo wasn't from that premiere.
Do you see who's behind him?

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:00.491
Uh-huh.

00:31:00.574 --> 00:31:03.035
Oh, my God.
Mom, seriously, do you live under a rock?

00:31:03.119 --> 00:31:05.037
She's an actress.
She's in, like, everything.

00:31:05.121 --> 00:31:06.122
-Right.
-Okay.

00:31:06.205 --> 00:31:09.000
Anyway, this whole thing
went down about this dress.

00:31:09.083 --> 00:31:11.836
She dissed the designer,
and they were going back and forth

00:31:11.919 --> 00:31:15.256
for, like, weeks, but that happened, like,
over a year ago.

00:31:15.339 --> 00:31:16.674
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

00:31:17.675 --> 00:31:19.010
-Well, look at you.
-[chuckles]

00:31:19.093 --> 00:31:21.971
And you didn't think
you were anything like me.

00:31:22.054 --> 00:31:26.642
-I mean, first we get arrested together…
-Okay, okay. [laughs]

00:31:27.435 --> 00:31:29.895
-Can we look this guy up?
-Yeah.

00:31:31.772 --> 00:31:32.773
Let's see.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.027
Here he is.

00:31:37.111 --> 00:31:38.779
Mmm, old.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:40.865
Old.

00:31:41.365 --> 00:31:43.284
-All these are old.
-Yeah. That one's definitely old.

00:31:43.367 --> 00:31:47.329
Okay, so if you're right, this guy
hasn't been seen in public for months,

00:31:47.413 --> 00:31:50.458
but he's posting old
pictures as if they're recent.

00:31:50.541 --> 00:31:52.752
-Shady.
-Might be more than shady.

00:31:52.835 --> 00:31:55.296
Maybe he's been hiding
the fact that he's sick.

00:32:04.138 --> 00:32:05.556
-Everything good with Morgan?
-Yeah.

00:32:05.639 --> 00:32:08.517
She had to visit Ava's school,
clear up a little truancy thing yesterday.

00:32:08.601 --> 00:32:09.602
What's going on here?

00:32:09.685 --> 00:32:11.937
Showed up just as Carson Wood
was about to head out.

00:32:12.021 --> 00:32:14.273
I suggested he wait,
his people didn't like that.

00:32:14.356 --> 00:32:16.025
So you decided to block the driveway.

00:32:16.108 --> 00:32:18.569
-Things are getting a little tense.
-Copy that.

00:32:20.154 --> 00:32:21.155
Carson Wood.

00:32:21.238 --> 00:32:24.575
Detectives Karadec and Forrester, LAPD.
Mind if we ask you a few questions?

00:32:24.658 --> 00:32:27.578
If it gets you the hell out
of my driveway, ask away.

00:32:27.661 --> 00:32:28.996
Make it quick.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.707
Does the name Nathan Gould
mean anything to you?

00:32:31.791 --> 00:32:33.417
[sighs] Should it?

00:32:33.501 --> 00:32:35.544
He's a murder victim whose
death we're investigating.

00:32:35.628 --> 00:32:36.921
Never heard of him.

00:32:37.004 --> 00:32:38.798
PS, I don't know if you looked at me,

00:32:38.881 --> 00:32:41.884
but I'm literally on my way
to get a heart transplant.

00:32:41.967 --> 00:32:44.011
I'm not running around killing people.

00:32:44.553 --> 00:32:46.806
Well, uh, now that you mention it,
one of the reasons we're here

00:32:46.889 --> 00:32:49.016
is to see if you're in
the market for a new heart, sir.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.769
We believe Mr. Gould was killed so that
his would be available for transplant.

00:32:51.852 --> 00:32:54.355
As for killing him yourself, I think
you could hire some people to do it.

00:32:54.438 --> 00:32:55.606
I can't argue with that.

00:32:56.732 --> 00:32:57.942
Hey, Karadec.

00:32:58.025 --> 00:33:00.653
The GPS is set
for the airport, not St. Clair's.

00:33:01.487 --> 00:33:04.115
Mr. Wood, would we be right
that you pressured St. Clair's Hospital

00:33:04.198 --> 00:33:05.825
to bump you to
the top of their transplant list?

00:33:05.908 --> 00:33:08.410
Maybe I did. Maybe I didn't.
Doesn't matter.

00:33:08.494 --> 00:33:10.579
Got a better heart waiting for me in Utah.

00:33:10.663 --> 00:33:13.332
Wait, so you're saying you
don't want Nathan Gould's heart?

00:33:13.415 --> 00:33:15.126
Is that the one at St. Clair's?

00:33:15.209 --> 00:33:19.505
Doc said it wasn't a great match,
technical stuff, not my department.

00:33:19.588 --> 00:33:23.717
And if that concludes our business,
I'd appreciate you getting out of the way.

00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:25.553
Time's the one thing I don't have.

00:33:26.137 --> 00:33:27.388
[Daphne sighs]

00:33:27.471 --> 00:33:29.473
[phone buzzes]

00:33:29.557 --> 00:33:30.599
Hey, how'd it go at the school?

00:33:30.683 --> 00:33:32.726
I convinced him that
30 minutes in a holding cell

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:35.062
can serve as detention, but whatever.
That's not why I called.

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:37.982
<i>I got a message from Soto.</i>
<i>St. Clair's Hospital called.</i>

00:33:38.065 --> 00:33:39.150
Oh, yeah, yeah, we know.

00:33:39.233 --> 00:33:41.443
Carson Wood didn't
even need Nathan's heart.

00:33:41.527 --> 00:33:42.987
Guessing it got put back into the system?

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:45.739
Well, it would've, but it's been stolen.

00:33:45.823 --> 00:33:48.325
-How does someone steal a heart?
-That's what we're trying to figure out.

00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:50.452
Hospital said everything went
normally with the organ removal.

00:33:50.536 --> 00:33:52.746 line:20%
They took the heart out of Nathan,
they packed up the transport.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.874
That's when it was supposed to
be driven to another hospital.

00:33:54.957 --> 00:33:56.333
But that's when everyone lost track of it.

00:33:56.417 --> 00:33:58.711
Someone with knowledge of
the process intercepted the heart

00:33:58.794 --> 00:33:59.962
on its way out of the building.

00:34:00.045 --> 00:34:02.298
So far, we haven't spotted
anything on the hospital surveillance,

00:34:02.381 --> 00:34:03.507
but we're still looking.

00:34:03.591 --> 00:34:07.219
How much time can pass between taking out
a heart and putting it into someone else?

00:34:07.303 --> 00:34:10.472
Hospital says six hours tops,
two of which have already passed.

00:34:10.556 --> 00:34:12.266
[Selena sighs] Then that's
how much time we have.

00:34:12.975 --> 00:34:16.270
Someone this killer cares about
is about to get a heart transplant,

00:34:16.353 --> 00:34:18.564
which means our best
chance to find the killer

00:34:18.647 --> 00:34:20.983
is while
that person is still in a hospital bed.

00:34:21.066 --> 00:34:23.903
After the patient's safe and sound,
our guy could be in the wind.

00:34:23.986 --> 00:34:27.489
Now, it felt like the transplant
coordinator was hiding things yesterday.

00:34:27.573 --> 00:34:29.700
Let's have her back in for a conversation.

00:34:29.783 --> 00:34:32.786
Now that the pressure's off from Wood,
maybe she'll be more forthcoming.

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:33.954
[Karadec] Yeah.

00:34:34.622 --> 00:34:36.582
I'm starting to feel
like I should have a lawyer.

00:34:36.665 --> 00:34:38.459
Oh, that's definitely a way you could go,

00:34:38.542 --> 00:34:40.836
given that we could charge you
with obstructing an investigation.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.339
You might lose your job,
so lawyering up might be the smart move.

00:34:43.422 --> 00:34:46.926
But, the truth is,
we're not looking to come after you.

00:34:47.009 --> 00:34:49.845
We need to find Nathan Gould's killer,
and we need to find him now.

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:53.432
If you help us, we'd be inclined
to forget your role in all of this.

00:34:53.515 --> 00:34:54.892
My role in this?

00:34:55.768 --> 00:34:58.270
-I didn't have a choice.
-[chuckles]

00:34:58.354 --> 00:35:03.609
If we didn't find Mr. Wood a heart,
he would have cut off millions in funding.

00:35:04.193 --> 00:35:07.238
That's money we use to
save countless lives.

00:35:07.321 --> 00:35:09.240
We're not here to judge.

00:35:13.285 --> 00:35:14.453
Okay.

00:35:14.536 --> 00:35:16.080
We have reason to believe
that at one point

00:35:16.163 --> 00:35:18.624
Nathan Gould
and his killer were cooperating.

00:35:18.707 --> 00:35:21.961
Let's say Carson Wood never interfered.
Who would have gotten the heart then?

00:35:22.044 --> 00:35:26.340
Nathan Gould left behind
a directed donation.

00:35:26.423 --> 00:35:29.051
He named the person
he wanted his heart to go to.

00:35:29.134 --> 00:35:33.389
And when Mr. Wood
pressured us to find him a heart,

00:35:34.265 --> 00:35:39.228
the committee and I,
we invalidated Mr. Gould's directive.

00:35:40.062 --> 00:35:44.108
-Whose name was on the directed donation?
-I don't know.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.569
I deleted any record
on the hospital system.

00:35:47.653 --> 00:35:51.699
You deleted the intended recipient's name,
and you don't even remember who it was?

00:35:51.782 --> 00:35:53.450
It's not that I don't remember.

00:35:54.535 --> 00:35:55.577
I didn't even look.

00:35:56.453 --> 00:36:00.207
That person is something
I don't wanna think about.

00:36:00.874 --> 00:36:02.293
[sighs]

00:36:02.376 --> 00:36:05.879
So, their name should still be
on the transplant list, right?

00:36:07.548 --> 00:36:08.549
Yeah.

00:36:09.675 --> 00:36:11.802
Is this the information we got
from the transplant coordinator?

00:36:11.885 --> 00:36:13.095
-The UNOS database?
-Yes.

00:36:13.178 --> 00:36:15.806
You're looking at everyone waiting on
a heart in the southwestern United States.

00:36:15.889 --> 00:36:18.642
Good, because that heart only has
about two hours of viability left.

00:36:18.726 --> 00:36:20.102
How we gonna narrow this down?

00:36:32.156 --> 00:36:35.367
Mm-mmm. No. Okay.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:42.166
This one, this one, this one all live
too far away to get the heart in time.

00:36:42.916 --> 00:36:45.794
These are the wrong blood type.

00:36:47.004 --> 00:36:50.549
And since a key factor in
a heart match is body size.

00:36:50.632 --> 00:36:53.635
You're out. You're out.
You're definitely out.

00:36:55.054 --> 00:36:57.431
-There we go.
-[Karadec] Hey, good work, Morgan.

00:36:57.514 --> 00:36:59.224
We can just
reach out to each of these hospitals--

00:36:59.308 --> 00:37:00.934
No, we won't have to.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.979
I gotta check something real quick,
but if I'm right,

00:37:04.897 --> 00:37:06.273
I know where to find the killer.

00:37:10.059 --> 00:37:14.456
Rosemary Caferri, 70 years old at
Eaton General, in end-stage heart failure.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.963
-She's the one getting the heart.
-How did you know?

00:37:16.987 --> 00:37:20.507
Because she was the only one left
whose profile said she was on albuterol.

00:37:21.367 --> 00:37:24.304
Yeah, paramedics said people were stealing
albuterol because of a drug shortage.

00:37:24.328 --> 00:37:26.348
I don't doubt that
there was a drug shortage,

00:37:26.372 --> 00:37:30.852
but people were not stealing albuterol,
one of the paramedics was, for his mother.

00:37:30.876 --> 00:37:33.021
-That's what you had to check.
-That's right.

00:37:33.045 --> 00:37:35.523
Caferri was Rosemary's
second husband's last name.

00:37:35.547 --> 00:37:40.278
Her first husband was a Bishop, just like
one of our paramedics, Christopher Bishop.

00:37:40.302 --> 00:37:41.904
He's Rosemary's son.

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:45.784
[Morgan] <i>Christopher and Nathan knew</i>
<i>each other because of Nathan's injuries.</i>

00:37:45.808 --> 00:37:47.827
<i>They must have shared</i>
<i>their struggles with each other.</i>

00:37:47.851 --> 00:37:49.871
So when Nathan decided to end his life,

00:37:49.895 --> 00:37:51.915
he offered to direct his heart
to Christopher's mother.

00:37:51.939 --> 00:37:53.583
But then Nathan changed his mind.

00:37:53.607 --> 00:37:56.293
Which meant Christopher had to
take matters into his own hands.

00:37:57.027 --> 00:37:58.880
<i>He staged the messy tables to make</i>
<i>sure that</i>

<i>that someone would find Nathan</i>

This even explains the where and when.

00:38:23.345 --> 00:38:25.907
Close enough to Christopher's firehouse
so he could show up to his shift

00:38:25.931 --> 00:38:27.826
before the call came in
and give himself an alibi.

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:31.079
And he could make sure that he was
the paramedic who was taking the call.

00:38:31.103 --> 00:38:32.997
He did all this to save his dying mother.

00:38:33.021 --> 00:38:36.292
[inhales] Well,
I'll have unis posted to stop Christopher

00:38:36.316 --> 00:38:38.085

I was only told that
a heart was available.

00:39:04.803 --> 00:39:07.157
Does he know that you know?

00:39:07.181 --> 00:39:09.159
[Karadec] He dropped off the heart
along with the paperwork

saying it was for you, and he left.

00:39:10.976 --> 00:39:13.955
Mr. Gould's directed donation
was still on file here too.

Christopher as your next of kin
