WEBVTT

00:00:25.227 --> 00:00:27.187
Kino, there are so many people.

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:29.732
Everyone’s watching.
I don’t think I can do this.

00:00:29.732 --> 00:00:31.525
Just keep your eyes on me. Okay?

00:00:31.525 --> 00:00:33.193
- for you…
- for you…

00:00:33.193 --> 00:00:34.611
Wonder…

00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:35.796
About to kiss?

00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:37.339
She just wiped something off my face!

00:00:37.364 --> 00:00:39.967
Didn’t we agree that our first kiss
would be with each other?

00:00:39.992 --> 00:00:42.177
For me, you were
the best one out there.

00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:45.039
If I were really that good,
then we should’ve won, right?

00:00:45.064 --> 00:00:46.140
I’ll just be here, okay?

00:00:46.165 --> 00:00:47.896
Let me do the chores for now, okay?

00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:50.044
Via’s feeling down.

00:00:53.047 --> 00:00:55.424
Group hug!

00:00:56.842 --> 00:00:59.136
The reason why…

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.721
Return anew—

00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:01.555
You passed.

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:03.248
Thanks for making me join.

00:01:06.507 --> 00:01:08.509
Would you get mad if I kissed you?

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.961
No.

00:01:10.516 --> 00:01:11.599
I wouldn’t get mad.

00:01:13.484 --> 00:01:16.879
- I just really don’t know what to do.
- You were really out of—

00:01:16.904 --> 00:01:19.336
Kino, what are you doing? Get up.

00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:20.443
Are you crying?

00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:21.867
Via…

00:01:22.076 --> 00:01:23.786
I think I have feelings for you.

00:02:36.998 --> 00:02:38.013
Via…

00:02:40.612 --> 00:02:42.406
I think I have feelings for you.

00:02:51.072 --> 00:02:52.365
What did you say?

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.510
Via, I have feelings for you.

00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:01.842
Maybe you’re just confused.

00:03:03.635 --> 00:03:05.304
Come on, let’s go home.

00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:11.876
How am I confused, Via?

00:03:14.158 --> 00:03:15.576
With this.

00:03:16.835 --> 00:03:17.836
With us.

00:03:19.812 --> 00:03:23.357
Maybe we’re just too used
to always being together.

00:03:25.193 --> 00:03:26.903
It’s making you confused.

00:03:29.745 --> 00:03:31.830
You don’t have feelings for me, Kino.

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.793
We’re just used
to each other’s presence.

00:03:36.793 --> 00:03:40.005
And if you’re just saying that
so I won’t drift away from you,

00:03:40.005 --> 00:03:41.632
you don’t have to.

00:03:41.632 --> 00:03:43.300
Don’t do this again, okay?

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:45.010
Via.

00:04:02.194 --> 00:04:03.862
Maybe—

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.868
we should also try
spending time apart?

00:04:11.995 --> 00:04:14.164
What do you mean, Via?

00:04:17.584 --> 00:04:19.586
Meet other girls.

00:04:19.586 --> 00:04:23.840
So you’ll realize that what you
feel for me isn’t real.

00:04:24.591 --> 00:04:26.802
Because it’s impossible, Kino.

00:04:27.594 --> 00:04:29.721
We’ve been friends for so long.

00:04:30.555 --> 00:04:31.765
You’re just confused.

00:04:34.977 --> 00:04:38.146
Yeah, maybe I am just confused.

00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:42.359
You go ahead, Via.
I’ll take a walk first.

00:04:42.359 --> 00:04:43.694
Huh?

00:04:45.028 --> 00:04:46.697
Let’s go home together.

00:04:46.697 --> 00:04:48.907
No, it’s okay. I need
to pass by somewhere,

00:04:48.907 --> 00:04:51.034
so you go ahead.

00:04:51.618 --> 00:04:52.828
Come on.

00:04:52.828 --> 00:04:57.040
No, it’s fine
I’ll see you tomorrow.

00:04:58.667 --> 00:04:59.668
You sure?

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:03.297
Take care, okay?

00:05:03.922 --> 00:05:05.173
You, too.

00:05:27.237 --> 00:05:29.239
Should I still prepare his lunchbox?

00:05:40.834 --> 00:05:42.461
Don’t take it off, okay?

00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:43.462
Promise?

00:05:46.131 --> 00:05:49.968
Via, isn’t Arkin here yet?

00:05:50.802 --> 00:05:51.803
Via?

00:05:52.054 --> 00:05:53.055
Huh?

00:05:57.476 --> 00:05:59.728
He might not be able to drop by today.

00:06:00.687 --> 00:06:02.606
Hurry up now
or you might be late.

00:06:02.981 --> 00:06:06.735
Are you sure, Via?
He might suddenly show up.

00:06:08.904 --> 00:06:11.740
Mira, help Ysha put on her shoes.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.325
- Kino, wait a minute. Let me fix this first.
- Okay.

00:06:13.325 --> 00:06:15.702
Wear your shoes now
so we can all head out.

00:06:43.397 --> 00:06:45.816
We go to school together
everyday, don’t we?

00:06:45.816 --> 00:06:48.026
Since pre-school even, right?

00:06:48.026 --> 00:06:49.986
Then we should keep it
that way until college.

00:06:49.986 --> 00:06:51.613
And when we start working,
we’ll still go together.

00:06:51.613 --> 00:06:52.614
No excuses.

00:06:53.782 --> 00:06:55.033
You’re so clingy.

00:06:57.702 --> 00:06:59.830
You’ll get used to it, Via.

00:07:11.425 --> 00:07:13.093
Did he come to school today?

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.431
Via! Hey!

00:07:17.431 --> 00:07:19.433
We’ve been looking for you.

00:07:19.433 --> 00:07:21.893
Arkin arrived early, so we
thought you were already here.

00:07:21.893 --> 00:07:25.689
By the way,
Sam’s asking if it’s okay

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:27.732
for you to be part
of her 18 candles?

00:07:28.066 --> 00:07:30.986
She sent a message in our group
chat but you haven’t seen it yet.

00:07:31.862 --> 00:07:34.531
Of course. It’s fine,
and I’ll be there.

00:07:34.531 --> 00:07:36.741
Okay. We’ll confirm it then.

00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:41.496
And tell Arkin to let
Sevi know about it

00:07:41.496 --> 00:07:43.498
since they’re not in
our girls’ group chat.

00:07:44.207 --> 00:07:45.041
Maybe…

00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:47.502
Maybe Sevi should just
be the one to tell him.

00:07:48.044 --> 00:07:50.422
Why? Are you okay?

00:07:51.965 --> 00:07:53.842
Should I tell them?

00:07:53.842 --> 00:07:57.679
Maybe not. Kino and I can
handle our own problems.

00:07:58.138 --> 00:08:02.267
Yeah, I’m fine. Just tired.
I did a lot earlier.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.311
All right.

00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:05.645
Just know that whatever
your problem is,

00:08:05.645 --> 00:08:09.149
big or small,
we’re here to listen, okay?

00:08:09.357 --> 00:08:10.734
We’ll back you up.

00:08:21.786 --> 00:08:23.622
I wonder if Kino already ate?

00:08:23.622 --> 00:08:24.956
He probably has.

00:08:24.956 --> 00:08:26.208
Hey, there’s Arkin.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.545
You should do this with your
hands so it won’t hurt.

00:08:30.545 --> 00:08:32.547
You just don’t want to listen to me.

00:08:36.009 --> 00:08:37.219
Come on!

00:08:37.844 --> 00:08:39.304
- The debut!
- The debut.

00:08:39.304 --> 00:08:40.555
You already said yes, right?

00:08:40.931 --> 00:08:41.932
You said yes?

00:08:41.932 --> 00:08:43.433
- You said yes.
- Yes. I did.

00:08:43.458 --> 00:08:44.514
- You gave your yes.
- Also—

00:08:44.539 --> 00:08:44.967
Yes.

00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:46.857
Right, I’m actually
excited about the dresses.

00:08:52.108 --> 00:08:55.028
Your hand just
needs to get used to it,

00:08:55.028 --> 00:08:56.613
and when you blend,

00:08:56.613 --> 00:09:00.784
your mind will also
get used to the tone—

00:09:01.618 --> 00:09:03.328
Why does it look so easy for you?

00:09:03.328 --> 00:09:04.996
It’s not. You just
need muscle memory.

00:09:04.996 --> 00:09:06.414
So just keep practicing.

00:09:06.414 --> 00:09:07.374
My—

00:09:07.374 --> 00:09:08.375
There you go.

00:09:10.126 --> 00:09:13.505
My melody, reflecting—

00:09:16.967 --> 00:09:20.095
It’s like how you focus on
the tone when you sing along.

00:09:20.095 --> 00:09:21.096
Okay.

00:09:21.513 --> 00:09:26.101
Listen to my melody—

00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:29.854
Look at you two. You might
actually end up together.

00:09:29.854 --> 00:09:32.232
You look good together.
Why don’t you just go for it?

00:09:32.232 --> 00:09:34.943
Right, you’re both talented anyway.

00:09:34.943 --> 00:09:36.903
Admit it, Arkin. You have
a crush on Naya, don’t you?

00:09:36.903 --> 00:09:39.239
Stop it, guys.

00:09:39.573 --> 00:09:42.284
He’s just teaching me.
You all sound ridiculous.

00:09:42.867 --> 00:09:45.287
Oh, Via’s here.

00:09:45.287 --> 00:09:47.080
You and Arkin are
close friends, right?

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.249
Would you approve of Naya if ever?

00:09:56.965 --> 00:09:59.426
There you go!
Approved by his friend!

00:10:02.846 --> 00:10:04.347
This is better.

00:10:04.514 --> 00:10:08.059
So Arkin will realize he
doesn’t actually like me.

00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:10.916
And so our friendship
can go back to normal.

00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:14.232
Hi, guys!

00:10:14.608 --> 00:10:16.651
- Hi, Pres.
- Hi, Pres.

00:10:16.651 --> 00:10:18.458
Welcome to our general assembly.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:23.700
But before we start, maybe Arkin
and Naya can sing for us first.

00:10:25.619 --> 00:10:27.412
They prepared a song for us.

00:10:28.219 --> 00:10:30.347
One, two, three, go.

00:10:31.173 --> 00:10:32.267
- Listen—
- Listen to—

00:10:32.292 --> 00:10:33.084
One more.

00:10:33.084 --> 00:10:34.085
- My bad.
- I’m sorry.

00:10:34.085 --> 00:10:35.378
I’m sorry, one more time.

00:10:35.378 --> 00:10:36.212
Okay.

00:10:36.212 --> 00:10:37.213
- Okay.
- You ready?

00:10:37.213 --> 00:10:38.173
Okay.

00:10:38.173 --> 00:10:39.174
Okay, ready—

00:10:39.633 --> 00:10:41.801
One, two, three, go.

00:10:42.969 --> 00:10:47.474

00:10:47.474 --> 00:10:52.187

Wow.

00:11:34.896 --> 00:11:38.024
You’ve improved so much from
the first time you started to now.

00:11:38.024 --> 00:11:39.609
You’re so quick at changing chords.

00:11:39.609 --> 00:11:40.777
Your guitar skills are really good now.

00:11:40.777 --> 00:11:42.754
But you should
still practice at home.

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:45.657
Arkin, you should walk Naya home.

00:11:46.449 --> 00:11:47.200
Right?

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.910
No. Let’s just all
go together. Let’s go.

00:11:48.952 --> 00:11:51.746
Come on, so you two
can have your moment.

00:11:51.771 --> 00:11:52.956
Come on, let’s go.

00:11:52.956 --> 00:11:53.957
Let’s go.

00:12:01.339 --> 00:12:02.643
I’ll go ahead. I’m heading home.

00:12:03.508 --> 00:12:04.884
We’ll walk you home.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.469
We’ll stay at your place first.

00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:09.681
Yeah. We’re not doing
anything anyway,

00:12:09.681 --> 00:12:10.865
so we’ll just hang out.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:11.975
Right! Is that okay with you?

00:12:17.021 --> 00:12:18.690
You both just want to walk me home

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.984
because Arkin and I
aren’t going home together.

00:12:21.501 --> 00:12:23.211
I’m fine. I can handle myself.

00:12:23.236 --> 00:12:25.530
Come on, we’re just worried
because you’ll be walking alone.

00:12:25.564 --> 00:12:26.589
- That’s all it is.
- And—

00:12:26.614 --> 00:12:28.992
You have siblings, right?
We want to meet them!

00:12:28.992 --> 00:12:31.745
Her siblings are super cute, right?

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:32.887
Come on!

00:12:32.912 --> 00:12:35.331
Aren’t you going to ask
what happened to us?

00:12:36.499 --> 00:12:40.670
You know, if you’re not comfortable
telling us, that’s totally fine.

00:12:40.754 --> 00:12:43.214
Just know that we’re here for you.

00:12:43.214 --> 00:12:45.133
Yeah. That’s more than
enough for us.

00:12:45.216 --> 00:12:46.426
You know we’re here, okay?

00:12:46.497 --> 00:12:48.650
Yeah, and if you do tell us,
that’s just a bonus.

00:12:49.179 --> 00:12:50.314
Right?

00:12:51.264 --> 00:12:53.016
I want to tell you guys,

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:55.977
but this is our problem.

00:12:56.394 --> 00:12:59.963
Then it’s your problem.
No problem.

00:13:00.064 --> 00:13:01.816
So, are we gonna hang out?
Come on.

00:13:01.941 --> 00:13:02.650
Let’s go home?

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:03.693
Perfect.

00:13:08.907 --> 00:13:12.786
- I’m excited!
- It’s so messy here at home.

00:13:13.411 --> 00:13:14.537
Come on in.

00:13:14.537 --> 00:13:15.789
- Sorry, it’s messy here, okay?
- Wow!

00:13:15.789 --> 00:13:16.498
Hi!

00:13:16.498 --> 00:13:18.099
- Hello!
- It’s so messy.

00:13:18.124 --> 00:13:20.251
- Hi!
- Sit down here first, sit down.

00:13:20.251 --> 00:13:21.252
Thanks.

00:13:21.252 --> 00:13:23.171
- Hi, guys!
- Hey, don’t!

00:13:23.171 --> 00:13:24.422
Hello, hello.

00:13:24.422 --> 00:13:28.276
- Pa, we’re here, I’m with my friends!
- Hi. Oh, what’s this?

00:13:28.301 --> 00:13:29.761
Hello!

00:13:29.761 --> 00:13:31.262
- Huh? What did you say?
- Say hello—

00:13:31.262 --> 00:13:32.972
- I’m here with my friends, Pa.
- Hi!

00:13:32.972 --> 00:13:33.890
- This is Kierra.
- Hello.

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:34.766
- This is Luna.
- Hello.

00:13:34.766 --> 00:13:35.767
Luna, Ke, this is Papa.

00:13:35.767 --> 00:13:36.893
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

00:13:36.893 --> 00:13:37.894
So polite of you.

00:13:37.894 --> 00:13:39.729
Okay, have a seat.
Make yourself at home.

00:13:39.729 --> 00:13:41.105
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:13:41.105 --> 00:13:42.774
Say hi. Introduce yourselves!

00:13:42.774 --> 00:13:43.775
Hello.

00:13:43.775 --> 00:13:44.776
- Hello!
- I’m Mira.

00:13:44.776 --> 00:13:45.777
- Mira.
- Hi!

00:13:45.777 --> 00:13:48.446
- I’m Ysha.
- Ysha!

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.074
Hi, Ysha! So pretty.

00:13:51.074 --> 00:13:52.075
I’m Aidan.

00:13:52.075 --> 00:13:53.535
- So cute!
- Hello, Aidan.

00:13:53.535 --> 00:13:55.245
Sit over here. Come here.

00:13:57.705 --> 00:13:58.957
Can I take you home?

00:13:59.415 --> 00:14:00.708
Don’t go home yet, okay?

00:14:00.708 --> 00:14:01.918
Have some snacks here first.

00:14:01.918 --> 00:14:03.127
- Huh?
- Sure, thank you.

00:14:03.127 --> 00:14:04.337
Pa, they just brought me home.

00:14:04.337 --> 00:14:05.463
They’re going home soon.
They might get home late.

00:14:05.463 --> 00:14:06.756
What? It’s fine.

00:14:06.756 --> 00:14:09.188
Our parents aren’t home
yet anyway, so it’s all good.

00:14:09.213 --> 00:14:10.510
Yes, we’ll just have someone
pick us up later

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:11.886
so we can stay late.

00:14:11.886 --> 00:14:13.179
Let’s play first.

00:14:13.179 --> 00:14:14.180
All right then.

00:14:14.848 --> 00:14:15.849
Nice.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:18.741
Let’s play here.

00:14:18.768 --> 00:14:20.144
Come on, feed me.

00:14:20.144 --> 00:14:21.771
- I’m the princess, okay.
- I got two. Here.

00:14:24.315 --> 00:14:27.110
Oh my god, it’s so good.
Uncle, this tastes amazing.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.986
Thank you.

00:14:27.986 --> 00:14:30.547
Sorry, Uncle, we ate a lot.

00:14:30.572 --> 00:14:33.199
What? It’s fine, just keep eating.

00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:34.284
Okay. Give it to me.

00:14:34.284 --> 00:14:35.702
- Just keep eating.
- You guys are so sweet.

00:14:35.702 --> 00:14:37.871
You know, this is
the first time Via

00:14:37.871 --> 00:14:39.432
has ever brought friends home.

00:14:40.123 --> 00:14:41.330
Hold on a minute.

00:14:41.708 --> 00:14:43.334
The camera’s a bit blurry, though.

00:14:43.334 --> 00:14:47.338
But I can clearly feel
how special this moment is.

00:14:47.547 --> 00:14:49.479
- Via, I’ll take a picture of you guys.
- Huh?

00:14:49.591 --> 00:14:50.675
Papa, come on.

00:14:50.675 --> 00:14:51.801
Go there and join them. Quick.

00:14:51.801 --> 00:14:53.011
- Stay here.
- Here.

00:14:53.261 --> 00:14:53.970
Come here!

00:14:54.304 --> 00:14:55.338
Okay.

00:14:56.347 --> 00:14:57.432
- All right.
- Smile, baby.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.019
Okay, smile. One, two, three—

00:15:01.644 --> 00:15:02.145
One more.

00:15:02.145 --> 00:15:04.814
- One, two, three, smile!
- So handsome.

00:15:05.231 --> 00:15:06.232
There you go.

00:15:06.232 --> 00:15:08.192
Cute, so cute!

00:15:08.443 --> 00:15:12.286
You know, I can tell that
you’re all good friends to Via.

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:13.479
Of course, Uncle.

00:15:13.525 --> 00:15:15.158
And Via is really good to us too.

00:15:15.158 --> 00:15:16.784
We can tell who she takes after.

00:15:17.535 --> 00:15:19.078
Yes and Uncle, she’s not just kind.

00:15:19.078 --> 00:15:20.538
Your daughter has
a beautiful voice,

00:15:20.538 --> 00:15:22.248
and she knows
how to play guitar, too.

00:15:23.207 --> 00:15:25.126
So you sing at school, sweetheart?

00:15:29.964 --> 00:15:31.382
That was just one time, Pa.
At school.

00:15:31.382 --> 00:15:33.760
It… it won’t happen again.

00:15:34.104 --> 00:15:35.803
I know you can play guitar,

00:15:35.803 --> 00:15:38.097
but I didn’t know
you liked singing too,

00:15:38.097 --> 00:15:39.330
just like your mom.

00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:52.612
Pa, we have other friends
aside from Luna and Ke.

00:15:52.737 --> 00:15:53.322
Yeah.

00:15:53.347 --> 00:15:54.932
There’s Sevi, Sam, and Yanna.

00:15:54.989 --> 00:15:57.033
- You’ve met Sevi already, right?
- Yes.

00:15:57.075 --> 00:15:58.993
Next time, if it’s okay,

00:15:58.993 --> 00:16:00.995
I’ll introduce Sam
and Yanna to you too.

00:16:00.995 --> 00:16:02.055
Sure.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.084
Luna, Kierra, are you
also friends with Arkin?

00:16:06.084 --> 00:16:07.585
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:08.844
Yes.

00:16:12.799 --> 00:16:16.010
Pa, Sam’s having her
18th birthday party next week.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:16.970
We’re attending.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.388
- Her debut?
- Yes, Uncle.

00:16:18.388 --> 00:16:19.681
Do you have something
to wear already?

00:16:19.681 --> 00:16:21.349
Okay, I’ll save up for it.

00:16:21.349 --> 00:16:25.770
No, Uncle, it’s fine.
Sam will be providing our gowns.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.647
We’ll also be
the ones to pick up Via,

00:16:27.647 --> 00:16:29.732
so you don’t have
to worry about anything.

00:16:29.732 --> 00:16:31.275
Oh, wow. Thank you.

00:16:31.275 --> 00:16:32.151
Yes.

00:16:32.151 --> 00:16:33.361
Go ahead, eat.

00:16:33.361 --> 00:16:34.696
Hotdog! Give Via a hotdog.

00:16:34.696 --> 00:16:35.947
Luna wants a hotdog.

00:16:35.947 --> 00:16:38.610
- Via, you should eat first.
- Just eat, there’s plenty more.

00:16:43.744 --> 00:16:46.079
Girls, thank you so much
for picking up Via, okay?

00:16:46.104 --> 00:16:49.127
It’s fine, and we’re excited too.

00:16:49.127 --> 00:16:50.521
Is she ready?

00:16:50.546 --> 00:16:51.547
Yes, she’s ready.

00:16:52.463 --> 00:16:53.631
She’s already dressed.

00:17:13.276 --> 00:17:14.527
Wow.

00:17:14.527 --> 00:17:16.404
Oh my god.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:21.826
We’re frozen.

00:17:22.785 --> 00:17:24.162
Via.

00:17:25.872 --> 00:17:28.124
Via, you look so beautiful.

00:17:28.124 --> 00:17:29.542
Are you the debutante?

00:17:29.917 --> 00:17:32.879
Jeez. You guys look beautiful too.

00:17:32.879 --> 00:17:34.756
Your hair looks great.

00:17:35.465 --> 00:17:37.133
Papa did my hair.

00:17:37.133 --> 00:17:38.134
What?

00:17:38.509 --> 00:17:39.761
Uncle, you know how?

00:17:39.761 --> 00:17:42.472
Of course. I used to help her mom,

00:17:42.472 --> 00:17:44.766
so I learned how to do hair.

00:17:45.808 --> 00:17:47.685
By the way, Pres is coming later.

00:17:47.685 --> 00:17:49.270
He’ll probably check her out.

00:17:53.733 --> 00:17:56.569
But she’s moved on already.

00:17:58.071 --> 00:17:59.322
Pa, we’ll go ahead.

00:17:59.322 --> 00:18:00.490
Oh, okay.

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:01.449
Bye.

00:18:01.449 --> 00:18:02.867
- Take care, okay?
- Thanks again.

00:18:02.867 --> 00:18:03.618
Uncle, goodbye.

00:18:03.618 --> 00:18:04.118
Enjoy.

00:18:04.118 --> 00:18:05.495
- What are we going to do?
- Hurry.

00:18:05.495 --> 00:18:07.705
- Pa, bye.
- Just be careful, girls, okay?

00:18:16.297 --> 00:18:18.466
Wow, it’s so beautiful.

00:18:22.303 --> 00:18:23.304
Oh!

00:18:23.638 --> 00:18:25.681
You're wearing contact lenses?

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.059
Yes, I'm wearing them.

00:18:28.059 --> 00:18:29.685
I don’t really use them much.

00:18:29.685 --> 00:18:31.187
I’m not comfortable wearing them.

00:18:31.187 --> 00:18:33.415
But I put them on for now.

00:18:33.689 --> 00:18:34.899
Beautiful. It suits you.

00:18:36.275 --> 00:18:38.402
What is this? Smells rich. Like—

00:18:38.402 --> 00:18:40.071
Where’s the after party?

00:18:40.238 --> 00:18:41.405
Let’s go to the after party.

00:18:41.405 --> 00:18:42.907
It’s a drinking party,

00:18:42.907 --> 00:18:44.524
and we’re not allowed to drink yet.

00:18:44.992 --> 00:18:47.912
Where are they now?
Where’s Arkin?

00:18:47.912 --> 00:18:48.871
Is Arkin coming?

00:18:48.871 --> 00:18:50.873
I can’t contact him either.

00:18:50.873 --> 00:18:52.708
Have you talked to Arkin yet?

00:18:52.959 --> 00:18:53.969
Huh?

00:18:54.252 --> 00:18:57.713
Not yet. It’s been a while
since we last talked.

00:19:03.749 --> 00:19:07.461
Wow. Yanna looks amazing.

00:19:07.595 --> 00:19:09.430
Are you talking about me?

00:19:09.892 --> 00:19:11.494
Front stabbers, huh.

00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:14.105
Wow. So dramatic.
We just missed you.

00:19:15.523 --> 00:19:16.999
Via!

00:19:17.024 --> 00:19:21.237
Wow. You look so beautiful,
like a guest of honor.

00:19:21.445 --> 00:19:22.822
Hi, ma’am. Hello.

00:19:25.074 --> 00:19:27.410
These two helped me get ready.

00:19:27.869 --> 00:19:28.870
In the car.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:29.912
- And me?
- Approved.

00:19:29.912 --> 00:19:31.122
No one’s gonna compliment me?

00:19:31.122 --> 00:19:32.498
Huh? Huh?

00:19:32.999 --> 00:19:35.376
Sevi, it’s okay.
Your outfit’s fine.

00:19:35.406 --> 00:19:36.423
It’s good.

00:19:37.211 --> 00:19:39.797
I should be the one
doing the 18 shots

00:19:39.797 --> 00:19:42.258
because I can handle all 18.

00:19:42.258 --> 00:19:44.886
Huh? You can’t even drink much.

00:19:44.886 --> 00:19:46.888
- Huh? Says who?
- I can drink more than you.

00:19:46.888 --> 00:19:48.347
- That’s true.
- Okay, then. Let’s see.

00:19:48.347 --> 00:19:49.015
Right?

00:19:49.015 --> 00:19:50.725
So?
You’re so full of yourself.

00:19:50.725 --> 00:19:52.143
Hey! Sorry, I’m late.

00:19:52.143 --> 00:19:53.686
- Hey, bro! You made it.
- Hey!

00:19:54.937 --> 00:19:55.938
Hello.

00:19:56.397 --> 00:19:57.398
Hey.

00:20:19.378 --> 00:20:20.588
Bro, come with me for a bit.

00:20:20.588 --> 00:20:21.339
Where, bro?

00:20:21.339 --> 00:20:22.173
Just over there. Come on.

00:20:22.173 --> 00:20:23.424
Go with him already.

00:20:25.676 --> 00:20:26.844
What’s up with that?

00:20:27.178 --> 00:20:28.638
Are you two fighting?

00:20:29.639 --> 00:20:31.182
What did I miss?

00:20:31.307 --> 00:20:31.933
Huh?

00:20:31.933 --> 00:20:32.850
What was that?

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:33.643
What?

00:20:33.643 --> 00:20:34.977
Why are you ignoring each other?

00:20:34.977 --> 00:20:36.479
Huh? No, we’re not.

00:20:36.687 --> 00:20:37.939
We’re not.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.983
Know what, let’s just
enjoy the night.

00:20:40.983 --> 00:20:42.902
I’m excited to see Sam later.

00:20:42.902 --> 00:20:44.737
Right, we’re all
so pretty. Let’s go!

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.854
Sam, ever since I met you,

00:21:59.854 --> 00:22:02.189
you’ve always been
the sunshine of our group.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.651
Always kind, calm,

00:22:06.193 --> 00:22:09.238
and you always
put others before yourself.

00:22:10.323 --> 00:22:12.408
Even when I know you’re tired,

00:22:12.783 --> 00:22:14.660
you still make sure we’re okay.

00:22:15.036 --> 00:22:16.203
Thank you so much.

00:22:16.203 --> 00:22:18.414
Thank you for
being that kind of friend.

00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:22.960
You deserve all the happiness
and love in this world.

00:22:23.419 --> 00:22:25.629
I’m happy I met you.

00:22:26.172 --> 00:22:27.965
Thank you so much.
We love you.

00:22:28.257 --> 00:22:31.344
Happy birthday. Happy debut.
I wish you happiness.

00:23:27.191 --> 00:23:29.402
Happy birthday, bitch.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.991
Cheers!

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:37.910
Cheers!

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:40.830
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.498
Cheers.

00:23:45.376 --> 00:23:48.838
First of all I wanna thank all of you
for coming here tonight—

00:23:48.838 --> 00:23:51.632
for going out of
your way for the debut

00:23:51.632 --> 00:23:54.260
of our only daughter, Samantha.

00:23:54.969 --> 00:23:57.847
Sam, happy 18th birthday,
sweetheart.

00:23:57.847 --> 00:24:02.560
My wish for you is that you
continue to shine like mommy.

00:24:02.768 --> 00:24:07.314
And that you walk with grace and
confidence in everything that you do.

00:24:08.065 --> 00:24:12.778
And I wish you everything,
the best that this life could offer.

00:24:12.778 --> 00:24:14.530
Because for me, you’re perfect.

00:24:15.114 --> 00:24:19.076
And also if there’s one thing
that I want you to remember,

00:24:19.076 --> 00:24:21.704
Sam, never forget yourself.

00:24:23.456 --> 00:24:26.125
Don’t forget our family.

00:24:26.959 --> 00:24:28.419
Our name.

00:24:29.503 --> 00:24:35.801
Because you are Selene Vera
and Senator Vera’s daughter.

00:24:35.801 --> 00:24:37.094
Only daughter.

00:24:38.679 --> 00:24:41.599
And we love you so much.

00:24:41.599 --> 00:24:42.662
Okay?

00:24:42.933 --> 00:24:43.934
Kiss mom.

00:24:44.393 --> 00:24:47.062
Isn’t she perfect, you guys?

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.690
She is so beautiful, right?

00:24:51.358 --> 00:24:53.861
You look so beautiful, sweetheart.

00:25:05.915 --> 00:25:08.918
Thank you everyone for
celebrating today with me.

00:25:08.918 --> 00:25:12.630
I hope you enjoyed this
special day as much as I did.

00:25:15.007 --> 00:25:16.383
Let’s go, Sam!

00:25:19.303 --> 00:25:22.640
But the night is not over yet.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.891
It’s just getting started.

00:25:23.891 --> 00:25:28.270
So, let’s get ready to party!

00:25:31.524 --> 00:25:33.025
Party!

00:25:41.784 --> 00:25:43.827
- Birthday!
- Happy birthday!

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.177
I wonder where Kino’s at…

00:26:03.138 --> 00:26:05.266
Happy birthday, Sam!

00:26:07.851 --> 00:26:10.396
- Happy birthday, Sam.
- She’s already drunk.

00:26:10.396 --> 00:26:11.564
Happy birthday, Sam.

00:26:11.564 --> 00:26:13.649
- Happy birthday, Sam.
- Yanna, I think you should sit down.

00:26:13.649 --> 00:26:14.817
Sit down for now.

00:26:14.817 --> 00:26:15.943
Seriously…

00:26:17.987 --> 00:26:19.530
There’s more.

00:26:20.698 --> 00:26:22.950
Wow, you’re strong.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.368
Yanna, what does that taste like?

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.913
You’ll try it when you’re eighteen.
Drink some water first.

00:26:27.913 --> 00:26:29.206
- Youngsters!
- Stingy.

00:26:29.206 --> 00:26:30.833
Guys, I forgot to tell you,

00:26:30.833 --> 00:26:34.670
Kierra’s in my hotel room,
just taking care of something.

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:38.132
But why are we missing someone?

00:26:38.132 --> 00:26:39.258
Where’s Arkin?

00:26:39.967 --> 00:26:41.093
Oh yeah, where’s he?

00:26:41.093 --> 00:26:45.389
Arkin said he went home
first but he’ll be back later.

00:26:48.809 --> 00:26:49.810
Wait guys.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:50.811
Here.

00:26:50.811 --> 00:26:52.313
- This one!
- What’s that?

00:26:52.313 --> 00:26:54.565
I tried this earlier.
It’s so good.

00:26:54.565 --> 00:26:55.858
Try this, guys, come on!

00:26:56.775 --> 00:26:58.152
This is really good.

00:26:58.152 --> 00:26:59.403
Sam, what are you doing?

00:26:59.403 --> 00:27:03.157
You keep giving out alcohol,
I’m getting dizzy.

00:27:04.033 --> 00:27:06.368
Can I try that, Sam?

00:27:06.368 --> 00:27:08.871
Of course, this is for you!

00:27:08.871 --> 00:27:09.872
No!

00:27:10.289 --> 00:27:11.749
Wait a minute.

00:27:11.749 --> 00:27:13.751
Just this for now. A mocktail.

00:27:14.376 --> 00:27:16.503
No, no. No, just a mocktail.

00:27:16.503 --> 00:27:17.671
- Much better.
- Mocktail.

00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:18.505
Youngsters!

00:27:18.505 --> 00:27:19.673
Ignore them, don’t listen to them.

00:27:20.591 --> 00:27:21.967
Where did you get that, Luna?

00:27:21.967 --> 00:27:23.218
From the waiter.

00:27:25.804 --> 00:27:27.097
Mocktail for you.

00:27:27.556 --> 00:27:28.766
Hold on. I’ll be back.

00:27:30.225 --> 00:27:33.020
Come on, let’s party
before this ends.

00:27:36.565 --> 00:27:37.441
Hey!

00:27:37.441 --> 00:27:38.442
I’m sorry.

00:27:38.442 --> 00:27:40.069
Oh, Pres, it’s you.

00:27:40.069 --> 00:27:42.363
I’m sorry, I didn’t see you.

00:27:42.821 --> 00:27:45.407
Just call me Acel,
I’m not your president anymore.

00:27:47.368 --> 00:27:48.369
Chevy!

00:27:51.288 --> 00:27:52.289
Via—

00:27:52.956 --> 00:27:54.583
It’s nice to see you
but I gotta get going.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.335
- Sure.
- See you again next time.

00:27:59.755 --> 00:28:00.631
What’s up?

00:28:00.631 --> 00:28:01.882
Wait, how do I look tonight?

00:28:03.425 --> 00:28:04.426
Is it good?

00:28:05.511 --> 00:28:07.471
What? What’s wrong?

00:28:08.263 --> 00:28:10.015
I don’t feel anything anymore.

00:28:10.599 --> 00:28:12.601
I really don’t have
a crush on Pres anymore.

00:28:13.727 --> 00:28:17.189
Know what, it’s fine.
Let’s go, I’m really hungry.

00:28:23.278 --> 00:28:25.197
Via! Via.

00:28:25.197 --> 00:28:28.742
Let’s go up to my hotel room.
We’re the only ones left here.

00:28:29.535 --> 00:28:30.452
Okay, let’s go.

00:28:30.452 --> 00:28:31.453
Let’s go.

00:28:36.041 --> 00:28:37.042
Just a sip, okay?

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:39.086
Finish your shot!

00:28:39.086 --> 00:28:41.505
Hold on. I’m teaching Via.

00:28:41.505 --> 00:28:43.298
You’re making Yanna mad,
quiet down already.

00:28:43.298 --> 00:28:44.591
You ladle-face!

00:28:45.175 --> 00:28:46.135
So annoying.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:47.469
- You do it like this.
- Okay, go.

00:28:47.469 --> 00:28:49.096
Grab a lemon.

00:28:49.096 --> 00:28:50.556
- Okay. Then?
- Like this.

00:28:50.556 --> 00:28:51.557
And then…

00:28:52.433 --> 00:28:55.477
- Wow, learn from the master, Via.
- There’s some left.

00:28:58.147 --> 00:28:59.148
Your turn.

00:29:01.108 --> 00:29:04.319
- Okay, Via’s turn. Go! Good job!
- Let’s go, Via!

00:29:05.571 --> 00:29:08.073
- Via, Via!
- Via, Via, shot, shot!

00:29:08.073 --> 00:29:09.324
- Shot, shot.
- Say what?

00:29:09.324 --> 00:29:10.868
- Put it— on the—
- Here you go.

00:29:11.285 --> 00:29:13.287
Step by step.

00:29:14.831 --> 00:29:15.923
Go, Via.

00:29:16.582 --> 00:29:19.460
- Drink, you’re so slow!
- Come on!

00:29:20.622 --> 00:29:22.312
Here’s the salt.

00:29:22.337 --> 00:29:23.338
What?

00:29:24.715 --> 00:29:25.698
Hey!

00:29:25.723 --> 00:29:27.349
You’re back.

00:29:29.094 --> 00:29:30.804
Have a drink already. Shot.

00:29:30.804 --> 00:29:31.555
Shot!

00:29:31.555 --> 00:29:33.056
- Catch up, man.
- Let’s go! Let’s go.

00:29:33.056 --> 00:29:36.310
Via, can we talk for a moment?

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.485
Go on, guys. Talk about it.

00:29:44.485 --> 00:29:45.527
- We’re good here.
- Go!

00:29:45.527 --> 00:29:46.987
Right? Right? It’s all good, right?

00:29:46.987 --> 00:29:47.988
Yes!

00:29:47.988 --> 00:29:49.323
- Do the shot!
- Do the shot!

00:29:49.323 --> 00:29:50.532
Drink!

00:29:50.532 --> 00:29:51.533
Go!

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.373
Don’t waste the alcohol.

00:29:58.373 --> 00:29:59.792
- Yeah.
- Just take the shot first.

00:29:59.792 --> 00:30:00.918
Drink it, girl!

00:30:00.918 --> 00:30:02.049
Huh?

00:30:02.336 --> 00:30:04.838
Huh? Huh?

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.178
Sevi—

00:30:11.178 --> 00:30:12.763
What are we supposed to talk about—

00:30:13.222 --> 00:30:14.223
You guys—

00:30:15.557 --> 00:30:16.558
What is it?

00:30:17.059 --> 00:30:18.936
What do you want to talk about?

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.188
Hey! Hey!

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:24.733
What are you doing?

00:30:27.653 --> 00:30:28.862
You were right, Via.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.449
I don’t like you.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.452
I was probably just
confused back then.

00:30:40.374 --> 00:30:42.209
And I never liked you at all.

00:30:44.795 --> 00:30:48.006
I’m not gonna say it
again so please…

00:30:49.675 --> 00:30:50.926
Enough of this.

00:30:52.803 --> 00:30:54.555
How long are we
going to be like this?

00:30:55.931 --> 00:30:57.057
Because Via,

00:30:59.059 --> 00:31:00.269
I can’t do this anymore.

00:31:02.187 --> 00:31:05.023
Are you just saying that
because you want things to go back

00:31:05.023 --> 00:31:06.149
to how we used to be?

00:31:06.984 --> 00:31:08.151
No, no.

00:31:10.028 --> 00:31:11.488
I like someone else.

00:31:12.739 --> 00:31:14.658
I just thought it was you.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:17.953
I just thought so.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:22.583
Maybe I just got used to having
you around so I got confused.

00:31:30.299 --> 00:31:31.300
Okay.

00:31:33.844 --> 00:31:35.512
So, are we good now?

00:31:38.849 --> 00:31:39.867
Yeah.

00:31:43.186 --> 00:31:44.396
Finally, thanks.

00:31:48.525 --> 00:31:50.444
But who is it that you like?

00:31:50.944 --> 00:31:52.654
Seriously, Kino.

00:31:52.654 --> 00:31:53.822
Is it Naya?

00:31:56.617 --> 00:32:00.120
Wow, you can’t even answer.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.204
So it’s her?

00:32:02.664 --> 00:32:04.333
So you don’t want to tell me yet.

00:32:04.958 --> 00:32:06.126
Come on, let’s go.

00:32:28.607 --> 00:32:29.691
Take a shot!

00:32:29.942 --> 00:32:31.276
- They’re okay now.
- Catch up.

00:32:31.276 --> 00:32:34.279
- Hey, they’re okay now.
- Catch up with us.

00:32:34.947 --> 00:32:36.490
- Too slow, man!
- Take a shot!

00:32:45.749 --> 00:32:47.250
Papa left us.

00:32:48.537 --> 00:32:50.038
I never thought it was possible.

00:32:52.798 --> 00:32:55.926
Realizing that you’re not
really meant to be together

00:32:55.926 --> 00:32:57.803
even if you already have kids.

00:33:04.468 --> 00:33:06.178
I’m so sorry, Sev.

00:33:06.687 --> 00:33:08.981
We’re just here
if you need anything, okay?

00:33:09.858 --> 00:33:11.526
We’re going to listen.

00:33:15.153 --> 00:33:17.656
I don’t really have
anything else to say.

00:33:19.408 --> 00:33:22.035
I just really feel
bad for my siblings.

00:33:24.162 --> 00:33:26.331
But maybe Yanna
has something to say.

00:33:26.331 --> 00:33:28.458
I saw her at the billiards hall
fighting with someone.

00:33:30.085 --> 00:33:31.878
You wanna say something, Yanna?

00:33:39.011 --> 00:33:46.226
I just feel like no guy
will ever genuinely love me.

00:33:47.561 --> 00:33:48.562
Because—

00:33:49.201 --> 00:33:50.699
Because of my past.

00:33:52.731 --> 00:33:55.901
You all heard about it
back in high school, right?

00:33:58.780 --> 00:33:59.781
My mom—

00:34:02.977 --> 00:34:06.605
posed for adult magazines.

00:34:12.627 --> 00:34:16.214
So people look at me like…

00:34:20.886 --> 00:34:23.055
I’m indecent.

00:34:29.519 --> 00:34:32.898
I only survived high school because—

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.282
because I met you guys.

00:34:50.207 --> 00:34:51.458
Yanna—

00:34:53.043 --> 00:34:54.669
We love you.

00:34:55.003 --> 00:34:57.089
We’re here for you.

00:34:58.215 --> 00:35:02.427
And the real love you’re
looking for, that’s us.

00:35:02.886 --> 00:35:04.638
We’ll give that to you.

00:35:11.937 --> 00:35:12.979
Thank you.

00:35:17.442 --> 00:35:21.279
I feel lighter now that I got
to share this with you.

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.911
How about you, Sam?

00:35:37.963 --> 00:35:40.674
I don’t like what’s
going on in my family.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.011
I have a half-sister.

00:35:47.722 --> 00:35:49.641
But she’s distant to me.

00:35:53.836 --> 00:35:57.632
I can’t even introduce
her to you, guys.

00:35:58.483 --> 00:35:59.943
‘Cause my dad hides her.

00:36:03.655 --> 00:36:06.783
My parents control
everything in my life.

00:36:09.619 --> 00:36:11.913
So, I had to sell myself out.

00:36:13.039 --> 00:36:16.668
So I could choose my
own program and move out.

00:36:19.796 --> 00:36:22.090
Even my freedom has a price.

00:36:24.293 --> 00:36:26.295
And it sucks so much.

00:36:31.266 --> 00:36:33.810
I know I don’t really open
up to you guys.

00:36:34.506 --> 00:36:36.383
It’s hard for me.

00:36:38.565 --> 00:36:41.735
You know how it is, I just don’t
wanna be a burden to anyone.

00:36:44.029 --> 00:36:45.724
Sam, what are you talking about?

00:36:46.781 --> 00:36:49.743
You’re not a burden, okay?
You’re not a burden.

00:36:50.452 --> 00:36:53.788
You can open up to us,
to me, anytime.

00:36:54.873 --> 00:36:57.209
I don’t really have
big problems anyway.

00:36:58.793 --> 00:37:01.421
Maybe there’s one thing.

00:37:02.339 --> 00:37:07.886
I don’t really see my parents much
because they’re busy with work.

00:37:11.723 --> 00:37:14.976
But it’s fine with me. It’s okay.

00:37:16.645 --> 00:37:18.855
It’s not really a big problem.

00:37:19.397 --> 00:37:21.358
So don’t worry about it, okay?

00:37:24.444 --> 00:37:25.612
How about you, Via?

00:37:26.071 --> 00:37:27.697
Don’t you have anything to say?

00:37:40.085 --> 00:37:42.545
I don’t know what to say.

00:37:46.841 --> 00:37:48.969
Maybe I just want to clear up

00:37:50.845 --> 00:37:53.848
that I hope you can be
a little more patient with me.

00:37:54.891 --> 00:37:58.520
I’m not someone who gets
comfortable with people quickly.

00:37:59.562 --> 00:38:01.147
My whole life,

00:38:02.232 --> 00:38:04.484
Kino has always been
the only one I’m with.

00:38:05.235 --> 00:38:08.780
He’s the only person
I ever called a friend.

00:38:10.156 --> 00:38:12.450
So I’m still not used to

00:38:13.702 --> 00:38:14.703
having others.

00:38:20.875 --> 00:38:23.211
I’m the eldest
among my siblings.

00:38:24.546 --> 00:38:29.592
My mom is gone.

00:38:30.593 --> 00:38:34.931
So I’m the one who
takes care of my siblings.

00:38:37.183 --> 00:38:39.477
My dad works in construction,

00:38:39.477 --> 00:38:42.230
so he’s barely
home the entire day.

00:38:44.983 --> 00:38:48.111
I’m basically standing
as a mother to my siblings,

00:38:48.111 --> 00:38:53.283
so sometimes I really
need to go home early.

00:39:01.833 --> 00:39:05.003
I still don’t know what course
I want to take in college.

00:39:07.297 --> 00:39:11.718
But I heard you
applied for architecture?

00:39:11.718 --> 00:39:15.388
Yeah, I did. Architecture.

00:39:15.388 --> 00:39:17.515
I know how to draw.

00:39:18.975 --> 00:39:21.728
I can do other things too, but…

00:39:23.229 --> 00:39:26.191
But I still haven’t figured out
what direction I want.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.568
It’s not clear yet.

00:39:31.363 --> 00:39:33.031
Maybe it’s because my whole life

00:39:33.031 --> 00:39:39.829
I was focused on my family and
taking care of my siblings.

00:39:41.456 --> 00:39:46.544
I lost the time to look for
and explore…

00:39:49.547 --> 00:39:51.549
what I really want.

00:39:58.264 --> 00:40:00.051
Where I’m actually good at.

00:40:05.049 --> 00:40:06.301
Come on, Via.

00:40:07.315 --> 00:40:10.276
As long as you keep
trying, that’s enough.

00:40:12.614 --> 00:40:16.950
I’m scared that while
I’m taking Architecture,

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:18.747
I might suddenly realize…

00:40:19.089 --> 00:40:21.758
Realize what I actually want.

00:40:22.796 --> 00:40:24.551
I’m scared that…

00:40:25.396 --> 00:40:27.690
That I might suddenly lose interest.

00:40:28.628 --> 00:40:30.463
Don’t lead with fear.

00:40:31.359 --> 00:40:34.404
Trust yourself that you’ll
figure it out someday.

00:40:34.676 --> 00:40:36.845
Just take it one step at a time.

00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:40.680
You know, this is also
a reminder for myself.

00:40:43.942 --> 00:40:46.194
I don’t have anything to say.

00:40:47.189 --> 00:40:49.673
Maybe when I get
a problem someday.

00:40:51.609 --> 00:40:53.027
Same here.

00:40:55.004 --> 00:40:56.906
I don’t really have a problem.

00:41:00.299 --> 00:41:02.175
If you guys ever have a problem,

00:41:03.455 --> 00:41:05.498
we’re always here to listen, okay?

00:41:09.235 --> 00:41:16.325
I’m happy because this is
the kind of friendship we have.

00:41:19.345 --> 00:41:21.071
Oh no, she’s crying.

00:41:21.723 --> 00:41:22.932
So are you!

00:41:27.097 --> 00:41:28.682
I love you guys.

00:41:33.443 --> 00:41:35.695
I love you guys, too.

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:38.239
Sevi!

00:41:38.656 --> 00:41:39.866
Oh, come on.

00:41:40.783 --> 00:41:43.661
You’re making me tear up, too.
I was okay!

00:41:43.661 --> 00:41:45.121
Stop making me tear up.

00:41:45.121 --> 00:41:47.290
- I’m fine!
- Everybody!

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:48.708
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:41:48.708 --> 00:41:50.084
Let’s drink to this!

00:41:50.084 --> 00:41:50.877
- Shot!
- Shot!

00:41:50.877 --> 00:41:52.003
We look so ugly.

00:41:52.003 --> 00:41:53.213
- Let’s take a shot.
- Via, Arkin.

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:54.797
We don’t wanna look ugly.

00:42:13.775 --> 00:42:15.693
Oh. Arkin, you’re here.

00:42:16.154 --> 00:42:17.180
Hi, Pa.

00:42:17.779 --> 00:42:19.656
You two were fighting
for quite a while.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.784
Good thing you’re okay now.
What were you even fighting about?

00:42:23.368 --> 00:42:24.869
It’s nothing, Pa.

00:42:25.241 --> 00:42:27.407
It was just a small
misunderstanding, Pa.

00:42:27.622 --> 00:42:32.252
Don’t worry. What matters
is we’re okay now.

00:42:32.544 --> 00:42:33.670
Okay.

00:42:35.296 --> 00:42:36.506
- Wait, Aidan’s crying.
- I’ll go.

00:42:36.506 --> 00:42:37.966
No, I got it. Papa
will take care of it.

00:42:37.966 --> 00:42:39.092
I’ll leave this here.
You kids take care of it.

00:42:39.092 --> 00:42:39.884
Okay.

00:42:39.884 --> 00:42:41.052
- All right.
- Just a moment.

00:43:11.405 --> 00:43:13.157
Kino, you’re lucky, you know that?

00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:16.671
You already know what
you want to do in life,

00:43:16.879 --> 00:43:18.464
and you’re good at everything.

00:43:19.507 --> 00:43:20.967
Not everything.

00:43:21.301 --> 00:43:23.011
I’m lucky because I have you.

00:43:23.595 --> 00:43:25.221
If you weren’t around,

00:43:25.221 --> 00:43:27.432
I probably wouldn’t know
what to do either.

00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:30.977
Of course you would.

00:43:31.269 --> 00:43:32.645
When you become an actor,

00:43:32.979 --> 00:43:34.606
I might actually be
your number one fan.

00:43:35.648 --> 00:43:38.985
The question is, do I
even want to be an actor?

00:43:40.111 --> 00:43:41.904
I know I’m handsome, Via.

00:43:43.239 --> 00:43:46.492
But you also know
I’d still choose studying.

00:43:46.701 --> 00:43:48.036
And you better!

00:43:48.036 --> 00:43:51.706
If you dare mess up your studies,
I’ll really get mad.

00:43:52.123 --> 00:43:53.416
Study first. I promise.

00:43:53.416 --> 00:43:54.876
- Promise?
- I promise.

00:43:57.545 --> 00:43:58.546
By the way,

00:43:58.546 --> 00:44:01.633
the entrance exam results
are coming out soon.

00:44:03.551 --> 00:44:04.802
I’m claiming it already.

00:44:05.053 --> 00:44:07.889
We’re both getting into
the school we want.

00:44:13.144 --> 00:44:21.819
You, from the past,
the present, and forever.

00:44:23.237 --> 00:44:24.238
Your new song?

00:44:24.489 --> 00:44:26.991
Just now. That line was nice.

00:44:27.408 --> 00:44:30.536
You, through the past,
the present, and forever.

00:44:38.836 --> 00:44:42.298
We passed España!

00:44:42.298 --> 00:44:44.008
I’m so happy!

00:44:44.008 --> 00:44:46.928
Oh my gosh. Dream school.
Is this real?

00:44:48.221 --> 00:44:49.097
Hey!

00:44:49.097 --> 00:44:51.140
Why do you look sad?

00:44:51.808 --> 00:44:53.309
Of course, I’m happy.

00:44:53.685 --> 00:44:55.353
But I’m still waiting for
the results from Diliman.

00:44:55.353 --> 00:44:56.729
It’s free there, right?

00:44:56.729 --> 00:44:59.482
So it’ll help Papa save money.

00:44:59.982 --> 00:45:01.150
You’ll pass.

00:45:01.787 --> 00:45:03.414
If you don’t, I’ll protest.

00:45:03.576 --> 00:45:07.080
“Let Via pass.”
“Let her pass.”

00:45:07.502 --> 00:45:09.796
Hey! Prom night!

00:45:13.913 --> 00:45:16.541
Oh no, February 18?

00:45:17.041 --> 00:45:18.751
That’s the day before my birthday.

00:45:18.751 --> 00:45:20.002
What if it goes on ‘til midnight?

00:45:20.002 --> 00:45:21.212
Are you going?

00:45:21.212 --> 00:45:22.964
I don’t have anyone to go with,

00:45:23.073 --> 00:45:25.283
so I kind of don’t
want to go anymore.

00:45:25.425 --> 00:45:26.426
I’ll go with you.

00:45:26.426 --> 00:45:27.694
Huh?

00:45:27.719 --> 00:45:28.928
Did you already ask Naya?

00:45:28.928 --> 00:45:30.096
You should invite her!

00:45:31.139 --> 00:45:32.890
Why? Can’t you be my date?

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:35.601
Isn’t it that when you go to prom,

00:45:35.601 --> 00:45:39.272
you have to go with
the person you like?

00:45:40.732 --> 00:45:41.899
You’re shy, aren’t you?

00:45:41.899 --> 00:45:43.067
Do you want me to help you?

00:45:43.067 --> 00:45:44.402
We can plan your promposal.

00:45:44.402 --> 00:45:46.696
No. I got it.
I can handle it.

00:45:47.155 --> 00:45:49.282
- Are you sure?
- Arkin can handle it.

00:45:51.284 --> 00:45:52.285
Wait.

00:45:52.285 --> 00:45:55.079
Is it okay if we all go together?

00:45:55.079 --> 00:45:56.581
Just the three of us?

00:46:00.918 --> 00:46:01.711
I’m already excited.

00:46:01.711 --> 00:46:02.628
I wonder what outfits we’ll wear.

00:46:02.628 --> 00:46:03.671
What should we wear?

00:46:03.671 --> 00:46:04.964
Oh, right, Via.

00:46:05.798 --> 00:46:07.133
I just remembered something.

00:46:07.133 --> 00:46:08.092
What?

00:46:08.092 --> 00:46:10.511
Mom said that
if we’ll go to prom,

00:46:11.137 --> 00:46:13.639
she’ll buy your prom dress.
She said you can’t say no.

00:46:13.639 --> 00:46:14.640
Huh?

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.893
- That’s nice.
- Okay?

00:46:16.893 --> 00:46:18.603
Okay.

00:46:27.737 --> 00:46:29.989
Auntie, thank you so much.

00:46:29.989 --> 00:46:33.117
Thank you for everything you’ve
done for me and my siblings.

00:46:33.117 --> 00:46:35.036
I’m happy to do it, Via.

00:46:35.036 --> 00:46:36.954
You’re already a part of our family.

00:46:39.499 --> 00:46:41.876
I’m sure your mom
would be really happy.

00:46:42.084 --> 00:46:44.086
If only she could see you now.

00:46:45.296 --> 00:46:48.466
Her daughter has grown up to be
such a beautiful young lady.

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:56.057
Via, can you promise me one thing?

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:57.350
What is it, Auntie?

00:46:58.518 --> 00:47:00.311
Enjoy your prom, okay?

00:47:03.231 --> 00:47:04.232
I will.

00:47:04.732 --> 00:47:06.234
Thank you so much.

00:47:10.029 --> 00:47:12.114
- You better go, you might be late.
- Thank you.

00:47:12.448 --> 00:47:13.157
- Take care.
- Bye.

00:47:13.157 --> 00:47:14.158
Thanks again.

00:48:59.597 --> 00:49:01.140
You look beautiful.

00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:03.434
Your outfit looks great.

00:49:04.518 --> 00:49:05.937
Just my outfit?

00:49:06.479 --> 00:49:08.856
All right, ladies and gentlemen

00:49:08.856 --> 00:49:12.151
may we go back to our respective
seats as our program

00:49:12.151 --> 00:49:13.861
- is about to begin.
- Hi, Arkin!

00:49:13.861 --> 00:49:15.321
Hi, Via.

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:16.781
So, shall we?

00:49:18.925 --> 00:49:20.368
- Let’s go.
- Okay.

00:49:34.006 --> 00:49:35.049
Best dressed.

00:49:35.049 --> 00:49:36.175
Wait a minute.

00:49:36.175 --> 00:49:37.635
Personality.

00:49:40.012 --> 00:49:41.555
Right, personality?

00:49:41.555 --> 00:49:42.556
Thank you.

00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:57.196
And our next award
is the face of the night!

00:49:57.947 --> 00:50:00.074
And the winner is...

00:50:01.033 --> 00:50:03.202
Avianna Diaz!

00:50:04.996 --> 00:50:05.788
It’s you!

00:50:05.788 --> 00:50:06.580
Go in front!

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:07.957
- Why me?
- It’s you!

00:50:07.957 --> 00:50:08.666
Why me?

00:50:08.666 --> 00:50:09.542
Hurry up!

00:50:09.542 --> 00:50:10.573
- Huh?
- It’s you.

00:50:16.716 --> 00:50:19.385
- Via, Via!
- So beautiful!

00:50:29.186 --> 00:50:31.063
I just wanna go home.

00:50:34.316 --> 00:50:35.109
Thank you.

00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:37.194
Once again, congratulations, Via!

00:50:37.194 --> 00:50:38.446
You may now have your seat.

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:40.281
Go, Via!

00:50:40.281 --> 00:50:41.866
- So pretty!
- Congrats, Via!

00:50:41.866 --> 00:50:43.993
- Congratulations, Via.
- Thank you.

00:50:43.993 --> 00:50:45.286
That’s my friend.

00:50:45.286 --> 00:50:46.287
Let me see.

00:50:46.287 --> 00:50:48.164
Wow, gorgeous!

00:50:48.164 --> 00:50:49.623
How about this—

00:50:49.623 --> 00:50:50.833
Nice dress.

00:50:53.419 --> 00:50:57.339
And now, It’s the moment
we’ve been waiting for.

00:50:57.798 --> 00:51:04.305
With a landslide of votes,
our Prom King and Queen are—

00:51:05.931 --> 00:51:08.934
Larkin Sanchez and Naya Madrigal!

00:51:27.953 --> 00:51:29.371
They deserve it!

00:51:40.758 --> 00:51:44.303
May we request our
Prom King and Queen

00:51:44.303 --> 00:51:46.680
to have their first dance together.

00:51:47.139 --> 00:51:51.227
Once again, let’s give it up
for Larkin and Naya!

00:52:03.364 --> 00:52:04.990
They’re so sweet.

00:52:05.699 --> 00:52:07.076
So sweet.

00:52:14.458 --> 00:52:17.086
Kino really looks
all grown up now.

00:52:17.517 --> 00:52:19.707
He’s not that runny-nosed
little kid anymore.

00:52:20.464 --> 00:52:24.885
Before, I used to feel sad about
how our lives were changing.

00:52:25.094 --> 00:52:29.140
But now, I’m slowly
starting to accept it.

00:52:36.313 --> 00:52:38.649
He really likes Naya.

00:52:38.649 --> 00:52:40.818
I’m happy for Kino.

00:52:40.818 --> 00:52:44.530
The important thing is that
our friendship is still okay.

00:52:57.084 --> 00:52:58.002
Excuse me.

00:52:58.002 --> 00:52:59.461
I’ll just step outside for a bit.

00:53:11.182 --> 00:53:12.349
Ow!

00:53:39.839 --> 00:53:41.466
You already got hurt.

00:53:42.296 --> 00:53:43.589
I have a band-aid here.

00:53:49.974 --> 00:53:51.768
Why do you have a band-aid?

00:53:52.056 --> 00:53:54.099
Because I know you’re not
used to wearing heels.

00:54:24.296 --> 00:54:25.673
Thanks.

00:54:39.103 --> 00:54:42.398
Go back inside, your partner
might be looking for you.

00:54:44.733 --> 00:54:46.318
Why are you bossing me around?

00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:52.825
Are you mad?

00:54:53.284 --> 00:54:54.285
No.

00:54:56.537 --> 00:54:57.955
I’m just annoyed because

00:54:58.956 --> 00:55:02.418
we agreed to be each other’s first.

00:55:03.919 --> 00:55:06.171
And now my first dance ended up
being with someone else.

00:55:08.966 --> 00:55:09.967
Wow.

00:55:09.967 --> 00:55:11.927
What can I do?

00:55:12.469 --> 00:55:16.724
Is it my fault
you became Prom King?

00:55:17.266 --> 00:55:18.892
What do you want me to do?

00:55:20.227 --> 00:55:21.645
What do I want?

00:55:25.566 --> 00:55:27.109
Dance with me now.

00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:28.068
Huh?

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.696
I don’t want to.

00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:35.034
Perfect timing.
There’s music.

00:55:41.081 --> 00:55:44.418
Can I have this dance,
Ms. Face of the Night?

00:55:49.256 --> 00:55:51.884
Sure, Prom King.

00:55:54.803 --> 00:55:55.888
Is your foot okay now?

00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:59.433
It’s fine.

00:56:06.273 --> 00:56:07.649
Is it okay if I hold you?

00:56:56.281 --> 00:56:58.075
Happy birthday, Kino.

00:57:00.661 --> 00:57:02.204
Thank you, Via.

00:57:05.541 --> 00:57:07.084
What now,

00:57:07.709 --> 00:57:09.670
I’m just going to be
your second dance then.

00:57:10.087 --> 00:57:11.338
For the dance, yes.

00:57:12.131 --> 00:57:13.632
But in my mind,

00:57:14.216 --> 00:57:15.759
you’re first in everything.

00:57:40.534 --> 00:57:43.078
How am I supposed
to get over this, Via?

00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:06.393
Kino.

00:58:06.935 --> 00:58:07.936
Hm?

00:58:10.022 --> 00:58:14.902
I’m happy we’re still friends
even after everything.

00:58:17.696 --> 00:58:18.697
Kino?

00:58:18.697 --> 00:58:19.698
Huh?

00:58:19.698 --> 00:58:20.908
I hope

00:58:21.366 --> 00:58:24.203
even after we graduate high school,

00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:28.957
nothing will change, okay?

00:58:31.678 --> 00:58:32.679
Of course.

01:00:29.023 --> 01:00:29.828
Kikiam is really good.

01:00:29.828 --> 01:00:31.288
- This is my favorite.
- So good, dude!

01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:32.914
Hey, bro,

01:00:33.332 --> 01:00:34.499
my game
is coming up.

01:00:34.499 --> 01:00:35.876
You better watch, okay?

01:00:36.209 --> 01:00:37.210
Of course.

01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:39.421
Even if you play like a noob,
I’ll still watch you, bro.

01:00:39.421 --> 01:00:42.215
Noob? You’ve seen me play, right?

01:00:43.258 --> 01:00:45.719
Do you already have a girlfriend
who’ll cheer for you there?

01:00:45.719 --> 01:00:47.846
None, bro. I’m focused on
basketball right now.

01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:50.349
And you? When you get to college

01:00:50.849 --> 01:00:52.531
you might start looking for
someone right away.

01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:59.816
Bro, it’s still her.

01:01:00.275 --> 01:01:01.276
It’s only her.

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.168
Who? Via?

01:01:07.574 --> 01:01:10.035
What the! I thought you took it
back after you confessed?

01:01:10.452 --> 01:01:14.206
I did, but my feelings for her
didn’t go away.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:18.752
I only took it back so
we wouldn’t ruin our friendship.

01:01:20.629 --> 01:01:22.881
Bro, looks like you’re never
getting over that.

01:01:30.305 --> 01:01:31.723
Sir, can I get more of that?

01:01:32.635 --> 01:01:34.137
Kikiam!

01:01:37.437 --> 01:01:38.715
I want you to listen to this.

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:40.033
I wrote it.

01:01:41.817 --> 01:01:46.822
Left thinking in the
midst of the chaos…

01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:49.825
Don’t take this off, okay?

01:01:50.659 --> 01:01:52.077
I’m your only best friend.

01:01:53.578 --> 01:01:55.455
You’re important to me, Kino.

01:01:56.415 --> 01:01:58.583
Are you kids lost?

01:01:59.126 --> 01:02:00.919
- Sevi!
- Sevi!

01:02:00.919 --> 01:02:03.422
Welcome to college!
I missed you guys.

01:02:04.664 --> 01:02:06.833
Let’s try to meet up often, please.

01:02:07.092 --> 01:02:09.720
It’s only the first day
and I already miss you.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:14.307
Oh wow, his clinginess
is acting up again.

01:02:14.307 --> 01:02:16.476
Mom’s acquaintance
who’s a talent manager

01:02:16.476 --> 01:02:18.109
wants me to join a workshop.

01:02:18.645 --> 01:02:19.646
Really?

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.606
I seriously have
a girl crush on this person.

01:02:21.606 --> 01:02:22.983
Who?

01:02:22.983 --> 01:02:26.069
What? You don’t know
Clea Zorel Aguilar?

01:02:26.177 --> 01:02:27.345
How about you, Kino?

01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:29.631
Do you like someone—

01:02:29.656 --> 01:02:30.907
You.
