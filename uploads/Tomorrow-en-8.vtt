WEBVTT

00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:26.629
I love you.

00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:30.648
You didn’t even read
the whole thing.

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:32.273
Okay?

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.446
Much better.

00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:35.764
I’m your only best friend.

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:36.823
Of course.

00:00:36.848 --> 00:00:38.116
Welcome to college!

00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:39.225
I missed you guys.

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:43.563
Do you like anyone
in your college?

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:45.152
I don’t like any of them.

00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:47.164
You?

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.944
I’m asking you. Do you like
anyone at your school yet?

00:00:49.944 --> 00:00:52.697
You didn’t know about
Arkin’s photoshoot, did you?

00:00:52.884 --> 00:00:54.062
I’m so stupid.

00:00:54.157 --> 00:00:55.492
You’re not stupid.

00:00:56.743 --> 00:00:57.952
You just like the guy.

00:01:00.246 --> 00:01:02.791
He wanted to
confess his feelings,

00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:04.751
but couldn’t
because they’re friends.

00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:06.211
What if I told you—

00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:07.378
I love you.

00:01:07.378 --> 00:01:08.755
Of course, you love me.

00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:11.633
We’re friends, right?

00:01:11.925 --> 00:01:13.651
I want to keep you all to myself.

00:01:13.676 --> 00:01:14.569
Mama.

00:01:14.594 --> 00:01:17.125
Didn’t I tell you not to
bother me when I’m writing?

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:21.351
You’ll leave me, too.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.678
Via, I bought pizza.

00:02:42.098 --> 00:02:43.111
Via?

00:02:44.017 --> 00:02:45.166
What happened to you?

00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:47.189
Why?

00:02:48.897 --> 00:02:50.690
Why didn’t you tell me?

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.582
You’ll leave me, too.

00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:13.313
No.

00:03:13.338 --> 00:03:14.589
I’m never leaving you.

00:03:14.797 --> 00:03:15.398
Okay?

00:03:15.423 --> 00:03:16.564
I’m really sorry.

00:03:17.008 --> 00:03:18.197
I’m sorry.

00:03:20.384 --> 00:03:22.094
You’ll change, too.

00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:26.017
You won’t have time for me, too.

00:03:26.017 --> 00:03:28.061
You’ll stop caring about me.

00:03:28.853 --> 00:03:30.980
You’ll leave me
just like she did.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.192
No. No, I won’t.

00:03:34.484 --> 00:03:35.627
Via, listen.

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:37.170
No matter what happens,

00:03:37.195 --> 00:03:38.529
I’m not going anywhere.

00:03:39.113 --> 00:03:40.240
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.160
because I was scared you
might feel the same pain

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.286
you felt before.

00:03:45.453 --> 00:03:46.913
Okay? I’m sorry.

00:03:46.913 --> 00:03:48.009
I’m really sorry.

00:03:48.373 --> 00:03:50.333
Kino, do you even know
how many times

00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:54.545
I wished Mama was still here
to take care of me?

00:03:56.839 --> 00:04:00.510
I wish I had a normal life
like you all do.

00:04:03.346 --> 00:04:06.224
I wish I didn’t have
to think about

00:04:06.224 --> 00:04:11.145
all the responsibilities
I have for my siblings.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.069
Kino, I wish I weren’t this tired.

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.452
If only she hadn’t gone
into show business,

00:04:26.452 --> 00:04:28.538
she would still be here with me.

00:04:28.538 --> 00:04:31.499
I wish she were
still here today.

00:04:35.837 --> 00:04:37.213
I know, Via.

00:04:37.755 --> 00:04:41.009
Okay? Please, I’m sorry.

00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:45.263
I’m sorry. Please…

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.273
Kino, she died.

00:04:56.774 --> 00:04:59.193
She knew she had
a kidney problem

00:04:59.193 --> 00:05:00.653
because she kept
taking those pills,

00:05:00.653 --> 00:05:01.904
but what did she do?

00:05:01.904 --> 00:05:04.532
She didn’t take care of herself.

00:05:06.868 --> 00:05:08.411
Why?

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.958
Why was it so easy
for her to leave me?

00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.836
Why was it so easy for her
to leave all of us?

00:05:16.836 --> 00:05:19.505
Didn’t she love us?

00:05:21.382 --> 00:05:23.426
Kino, why was it
so easy for her

00:05:23.426 --> 00:05:26.471
to dump everything on me?

00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:31.726
Via, I don’t think
that’s how it was.

00:05:31.726 --> 00:05:34.896
Your mom was kind, and
she loved all of you.

00:05:35.813 --> 00:05:38.816
You don’t know how I felt.

00:05:40.193 --> 00:05:42.362
Instead of playing,

00:05:42.362 --> 00:05:46.074
I was carrying my crying
sibling in my arms,

00:05:46.074 --> 00:05:49.035
and you know what
Mama was doing then?

00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:53.623
Mama was right there,
busy with her music.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.294
How important is that to you all?

00:05:58.294 --> 00:06:02.830
All that fucking attention,
Kino, and for what?

00:06:03.132 --> 00:06:07.428
Can’t you live without it?

00:06:12.892 --> 00:06:13.893
Via…

00:06:14.936 --> 00:06:15.937
Via.

00:06:20.024 --> 00:06:21.067
Via, I need to do this.

00:06:21.067 --> 00:06:22.360
Please, you have to understand.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.853
But why?

00:06:24.821 --> 00:06:26.030
Do you know how many times

00:06:26.055 --> 00:06:29.649
Mama came home after
people threw things at her?

00:06:29.674 --> 00:06:32.829
Those same people
who adored her

00:06:32.829 --> 00:06:33.788
when she was on top,

00:06:33.788 --> 00:06:37.041
but stepped all over her
when she was down.

00:06:38.584 --> 00:06:41.045
Kino, that hurt so much.

00:06:43.297 --> 00:06:46.801
Do you know how painful
it was to witness that?

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:51.033
Kino…

00:06:54.934 --> 00:06:56.579
Kino, I won’t be able
to handle it

00:06:56.604 --> 00:06:58.481
if that happens to you.

00:07:00.356 --> 00:07:02.316
Kino, I don’t want you
to get hurt.

00:07:02.316 --> 00:07:06.154
I can’t watch you suffer.

00:07:07.155 --> 00:07:11.576
Why do you keep putting yourself
under that spotlight?

00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:16.105
Can’t you just focus
on your studies instead?

00:07:16.613 --> 00:07:19.408
Via, I know that pain.

00:07:19.876 --> 00:07:22.253
Mama went through that too, but—

00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:29.093
I still want to do this.

00:07:29.093 --> 00:07:30.595
I really want this.

00:07:33.222 --> 00:07:37.226
This can help my name if I want
to get into the film industry.

00:07:37.393 --> 00:07:38.426
Via—

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:41.948
Via, I’m thinking
about my future too.

00:07:44.066 --> 00:07:46.277
This is good for
my career, so please

00:07:46.277 --> 00:07:48.446
don’t stop me from doing this.

00:07:58.831 --> 00:07:59.832
I’m sorry.

00:08:01.083 --> 00:08:02.585
I’m really sorry.

00:08:03.336 --> 00:08:04.462
Please, I’m sorry.

00:08:07.507 --> 00:08:08.633
- I’m sorry.
- No.

00:08:10.301 --> 00:08:11.552
I’m sorry, Larkin.

00:08:13.554 --> 00:08:14.847
I’m sorry.

00:08:18.017 --> 00:08:19.894
I’m sorry for what I said.

00:08:19.894 --> 00:08:21.646
I shouldn’t have said that.

00:08:21.646 --> 00:08:23.064
I was wrong.

00:08:26.359 --> 00:08:29.695
I’m happy for you. I really am.

00:08:33.282 --> 00:08:34.867
Don’t worry.

00:08:38.621 --> 00:08:40.122
I’m still here.

00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:45.461
I’ll still be here,
right behind you.

00:08:46.128 --> 00:08:48.756
But Kino, don’t neglect yourself,

00:08:48.756 --> 00:08:51.133
don’t neglect your studies, okay?

00:08:52.301 --> 00:08:55.263
Being a director is still
your real dream, right?

00:09:05.606 --> 00:09:08.025
Sorry.

00:09:43.769 --> 00:09:44.793
Sweetheart?

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:46.939
Are you all right?

00:09:48.524 --> 00:09:49.734
Did something happen?

00:10:00.244 --> 00:10:01.454
Are you still upset?

00:10:03.664 --> 00:10:06.457
Are you still not visiting
your mom this year?

00:10:13.674 --> 00:10:14.785
You know, sweetheart,

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.346
your mom loved you,
even if she’s gone.

00:10:20.891 --> 00:10:22.393
You never fell short for her.

00:10:25.353 --> 00:10:27.313
Until her last breath,

00:10:28.564 --> 00:10:31.525
she was looking for you
and your siblings.

00:10:35.905 --> 00:10:39.367
If I could apologize for
everything she did, I would.

00:10:42.495 --> 00:10:43.913
I’m sorry, Via.

00:10:44.497 --> 00:10:46.957
You had to carry all
that weight on your back.

00:10:48.042 --> 00:10:49.293
But don’t worry.

00:10:50.336 --> 00:10:53.631
Papa’s here to help you
carry everything.

00:10:57.551 --> 00:11:00.096
Everything you’ve done
for your siblings.

00:11:00.206 --> 00:11:01.416
Even for Arkin.

00:11:03.057 --> 00:11:07.061
I know they won’t leave you
the way your mom did.

00:11:08.854 --> 00:11:10.940
And your mom
didn’t want that either.

00:11:12.191 --> 00:11:13.484
So cheer up now.

00:11:17.321 --> 00:11:18.332
Okay?

00:11:30.209 --> 00:11:31.794
Thank you, Papa.

00:11:33.546 --> 00:11:34.839
Thank you.

00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:44.402
All right.

00:11:45.182 --> 00:11:46.559
Are you okay?

00:11:48.144 --> 00:11:49.353
You need me to stay?

00:11:50.062 --> 00:11:51.439
No, I’m okay.

00:12:13.335 --> 00:12:16.297
Via? Please don’t be mad
at me anymore.

00:12:16.773 --> 00:12:20.360
I’m really sorry, Via.

00:12:26.223 --> 00:12:29.602
I’m not mad, Kino.

00:12:50.539 --> 00:12:51.749
Our project for—

00:12:51.749 --> 00:12:53.501
- I haven’t started it yet.
- Yeah, same.

00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:54.877
- I’ll do it later.
- Hey! There’s Via.

00:12:54.877 --> 00:12:56.837
Via! Have you been waiting long?

00:12:57.171 --> 00:12:59.423
Kind of. Just a bit.

00:12:59.548 --> 00:13:01.759
By the way, this is Dan.

00:13:02.802 --> 00:13:04.345
Yeah, we’ve already met.

00:13:04.845 --> 00:13:07.223
There you go.

00:13:07.223 --> 00:13:09.475
- So they already know each other.
- They know each other.

00:13:09.475 --> 00:13:10.768
He has a crush on you.

00:13:10.793 --> 00:13:12.205
Hey, idiot! No, I don’t.

00:13:12.603 --> 00:13:14.021
Don’t believe them.

00:13:14.271 --> 00:13:15.773
Look at him,
he’s being defensive.

00:13:15.798 --> 00:13:17.508
- Hi, Via.
- Hi.

00:13:18.067 --> 00:13:19.819
Hi, Via? Hi, Via?

00:13:22.696 --> 00:13:23.720
Via!

00:13:24.114 --> 00:13:26.158
Wanna hangout next week at my school?

00:13:26.207 --> 00:13:27.208
I’m free.

00:13:30.433 --> 00:13:31.501
Sure.

00:13:31.956 --> 00:13:33.332
You’re in front of your crush.

00:13:33.332 --> 00:13:34.517
Fix it.

00:13:34.542 --> 00:13:36.502
Hey, Via. They said
let’s go to the cafeteria.

00:13:36.658 --> 00:13:39.939
- Let’s go! All right, let’s go then.
- Let’s go to the cafeteria.

00:13:39.964 --> 00:13:41.590
Look at you, acting shy.

00:13:41.615 --> 00:13:42.866
Come on, Via.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.426
Seriously, this guy...

00:13:57.648 --> 00:13:58.673
Via!

00:13:59.448 --> 00:14:01.742
Sorry, my class took so long.

00:14:02.934 --> 00:14:04.004
It’s okay.

00:14:04.209 --> 00:14:05.919
So, how was your class?

00:14:06.448 --> 00:14:09.994
Can you still handle studying
and acting at the same time?

00:14:12.621 --> 00:14:13.706
I’m managing.

00:14:14.665 --> 00:14:17.293
And don’t worry.
I won’t neglect my studies.

00:14:17.835 --> 00:14:18.845
You better.

00:14:23.883 --> 00:14:26.302
Look, they’re so sweet.

00:14:27.344 --> 00:14:29.471
Is that Luna’s boyfriend, Kalix?

00:14:30.097 --> 00:14:31.156
Yeah.

00:14:31.181 --> 00:14:32.892
I feel like they’re
really meant to be.

00:14:33.434 --> 00:14:34.439
How can you tell?

00:14:36.228 --> 00:14:38.063
Luna looks different.

00:14:38.647 --> 00:14:43.193
You can see that she’s
super in love with Kalix.

00:14:46.906 --> 00:14:48.157
I wonder what that feels like.

00:14:59.543 --> 00:15:00.769
What about you?

00:15:00.794 --> 00:15:03.088
Don’t you like
anyone you work with?

00:15:03.839 --> 00:15:05.966
You’re surrounded by
so many pretty girls.

00:15:09.511 --> 00:15:11.055
Why are you asking that?

00:15:19.063 --> 00:15:20.230
Just kidding.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.291
No.

00:15:22.316 --> 00:15:23.734
I don’t like anyone there.

00:15:24.485 --> 00:15:25.069
You?

00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:26.236
Do you like anyone?

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.623
You… You’re the one I like.

00:15:37.623 --> 00:15:41.585
But it can’t happen,
so being friends is enough.

00:16:02.773 --> 00:16:03.774
Hold still.

00:16:29.967 --> 00:16:31.093
By the way, Via…

00:16:31.844 --> 00:16:34.763
I might get a little busy
starting next week.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.849
I have some acting gigs lined up.

00:16:37.099 --> 00:16:38.225
They’re just small roles,

00:16:38.225 --> 00:16:41.854
but you know me,
I always do my best.

00:16:43.147 --> 00:16:46.358
Just tell me when it airs, okay?

00:16:47.234 --> 00:16:48.235
I’ll watch you.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:50.529
Thank you, Via.

00:16:53.782 --> 00:16:54.658
It’s so hot, Kino.

00:16:56.035 --> 00:16:56.577
It’s so hot.

00:16:56.577 --> 00:16:58.579
Is your classroom too warm?

00:16:58.912 --> 00:17:00.011
Did you even shower
this morning?

00:17:00.036 --> 00:17:01.037
You kinda stink.

00:17:01.707 --> 00:17:03.292
Do you know how expensive
my perfume is

00:17:03.292 --> 00:17:04.168
and then you’re telling me—

00:17:04.168 --> 00:17:05.044
- that I stink?
- That’s different.

00:17:05.044 --> 00:17:06.336
Perfume and deodorant
are different.

00:17:06.336 --> 00:17:07.946
My soap is expensive too, Via.

00:17:07.971 --> 00:17:09.848
I said deodorant, didn’t I?

00:17:09.923 --> 00:17:11.633
I use alum powder sometimes.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:32.613
So you’re okay with that scene?

00:17:32.613 --> 00:17:34.256
And you know where
it picks up from, right?

00:17:34.281 --> 00:17:36.492
For the next sequence
we’re shooting,

00:17:36.492 --> 00:17:39.828
does the director want
a big reaction from me?

00:17:39.995 --> 00:17:42.456
Maybe keep it subtle so
you don’t overshadow Paul.

00:17:42.456 --> 00:17:43.749
- But tell me, okay? When—
- Just do better next time.

00:17:43.749 --> 00:17:46.251
- Tell me if the director has any comments.
- Of course.

00:17:46.251 --> 00:17:47.086
Yeah. That’s fine.

00:17:47.086 --> 00:17:48.170
The set will be ready
in five minutes, okay?

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.129
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:17:49.129 --> 00:17:50.355
Thank you.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.132
Do you have a lot of scenes?

00:17:53.092 --> 00:17:55.969
Actually, I got more scenes

00:17:55.969 --> 00:17:59.157
because the director
seems to like me.

00:17:59.681 --> 00:18:03.685
Really now? Maybe your
acting was just very good.

00:18:03.685 --> 00:18:06.230
That’s a given, but I feel
like he noticed

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:07.815
how handsome I am. And—

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:10.931
Hello?

00:18:12.069 --> 00:18:13.070
Via?

00:18:14.995 --> 00:18:15.996
Via!

00:18:16.406 --> 00:18:18.117
Be careful there, Kino.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:19.952
Darn it, we lost connection.

00:18:20.244 --> 00:18:21.245
I’ll just call later.

00:18:45.144 --> 00:18:48.230
Kino, are you home already?

00:18:57.447 --> 00:18:59.950
Not yet.
I’ll message you later,

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.870
still busy with the shoot.

00:19:27.352 --> 00:19:29.735
Kino has so many friends now.

00:19:35.678 --> 00:19:37.930
I hope you’re doing okay, Ke.

00:19:38.822 --> 00:19:40.991
Thanks, the therapist
you recommended

00:19:40.991 --> 00:19:42.701
really helped me.

00:19:44.369 --> 00:19:45.579
Thank you.

00:19:45.913 --> 00:19:47.331
You guys didn’t leave me.

00:19:51.623 --> 00:19:52.958
Of course, Ke.

00:19:54.004 --> 00:19:56.798
We’re here for you,
we won’t leave you.

00:20:01.428 --> 00:20:02.512
What about you?

00:20:03.265 --> 00:20:04.599
How are you?

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:07.899
I’m fine.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:10.604
She says she’s fine, but
she’s been crying nonstop.

00:20:10.604 --> 00:20:12.456
Don’t hold it in.
Go ahead, let it out.

00:20:12.481 --> 00:20:13.565
I don’t want to cry anymore.

00:20:13.565 --> 00:20:15.901
I’ve cried too much over Kalix.

00:20:15.901 --> 00:20:16.993
It’s too much.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:18.654
Just too much. I’m done.

00:20:19.613 --> 00:20:21.531
This is the first time
I’ve seen Luna and Ke

00:20:21.531 --> 00:20:23.909
like this because of guys.

00:20:24.188 --> 00:20:27.501
But it’s also the first time
I’ve seen them fall this hard.

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:30.485
It’s scary when
it backfires on you.

00:20:32.542 --> 00:20:34.169
Where’s Arkin by the way?

00:20:34.419 --> 00:20:37.297
Is he still busy
with his acting gigs?

00:20:38.374 --> 00:20:41.293
Yeah. His shoots have
been nonstop ever since

00:20:41.318 --> 00:20:43.149
he got cast in that teleserye.

00:20:44.096 --> 00:20:46.682
Wow, my best friend is
really getting famous.

00:20:47.224 --> 00:20:49.268
Wow, stealing best friends now?

00:20:49.268 --> 00:20:50.435
He’s Via’s best friend.

00:20:50.435 --> 00:20:52.854
But seriously,
tell Arkin he should rest.

00:20:52.854 --> 00:20:54.516
He might get sick at this rate.

00:20:55.274 --> 00:20:57.985
Yeah, it feels like he hasn’t
checked in for a long time.

00:20:58.527 --> 00:20:59.528
You’re right.

00:20:59.903 --> 00:21:01.571
But we’re meeting later.

00:21:05.993 --> 00:21:07.327
Eat first, Ke.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.725
Kino, are we
still meeting later?

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.502
I’ll stop by your school.

00:21:13.792 --> 00:21:14.793
I’ll smack you!

00:21:14.793 --> 00:21:16.920
I don’t want to cry anymore.
I’m exhausted.

00:21:22.027 --> 00:21:23.813
Kino, I’m here now.

00:21:29.971 --> 00:21:33.683
It’s been days, and
Kino’s barely been replying.

00:21:33.708 --> 00:21:35.252
I hope he’s okay.

00:21:35.277 --> 00:21:38.863
Via, aren’t you the one
who’s always with Arkin?

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:39.543
Yeah.

00:21:39.568 --> 00:21:40.735
How is he?

00:21:41.403 --> 00:21:42.612
Is he not coming back?

00:21:43.572 --> 00:21:44.698
Coming back where?

00:21:44.698 --> 00:21:47.200
To class. He’s been
absent for a while.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.923
I’m just worried.

00:21:49.328 --> 00:21:50.620
What happened to him?

00:21:52.039 --> 00:21:54.124
Or is he just really busy
with his shoots now?

00:21:58.962 --> 00:22:00.547
All right, I’ll go ahead.

00:22:07.012 --> 00:22:09.514
But Kino, don’t neglect yourself,

00:22:09.514 --> 00:22:12.204
don’t neglect your studies, okay?

00:22:12.678 --> 00:22:15.514
Being a director is
still your real dream, right?

00:22:18.545 --> 00:22:21.674
The question is, do I
even want to be an actor?

00:22:21.902 --> 00:22:24.863
But you also know
I’d still choose studying.

00:22:24.863 --> 00:22:26.281
And you better!

00:22:26.281 --> 00:22:28.116
If you dare mess up your studies,

00:22:28.116 --> 00:22:29.951
I’ll really get mad.

00:22:29.951 --> 00:22:31.161
Study first. I promise.

00:22:31.161 --> 00:22:32.496
- Promise?
- I promise.

00:22:53.683 --> 00:22:54.704
Via!

00:22:56.144 --> 00:22:57.145
You’re here.

00:22:57.771 --> 00:22:59.081
Did you text me?

00:22:59.106 --> 00:23:00.023
Sorry, my phone was
low on battery,

00:23:00.023 --> 00:23:01.188
so I couldn’t reply.

00:23:01.287 --> 00:23:02.747
So, have you eaten yet?

00:23:03.485 --> 00:23:04.903
How’s your class?

00:23:07.364 --> 00:23:08.868
I don’t have class today.
It’s tomorrow.

00:23:09.157 --> 00:23:10.450
Perfect timing, huh?

00:23:15.622 --> 00:23:17.416
You’re such a liar.

00:23:18.875 --> 00:23:20.836
Acting really does suit you.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:39.435
Via, I can explain.

00:23:40.689 --> 00:23:43.108
You’ve had so many
chances to explain,

00:23:44.192 --> 00:23:45.610
why didn’t you?

00:23:47.821 --> 00:23:49.322
What did I ever do to you?

00:23:53.034 --> 00:23:55.036
You made me look like an idiot.

00:23:55.494 --> 00:23:57.758
I kept asking questions
about your classes.

00:23:59.541 --> 00:24:01.555
Why did you lie to me? Tell me.

00:24:02.506 --> 00:24:03.805
What did I do to you?

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.836
Nothing, Via.

00:24:10.302 --> 00:24:11.360
Nothing?

00:24:11.636 --> 00:24:12.703
So I did nothing wrong.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:15.307
Then why didn’t you tell me?

00:24:17.017 --> 00:24:18.560
Do you not trust me anymore?

00:24:20.854 --> 00:24:21.771
What else about you
is even real?

00:24:21.771 --> 00:24:23.106
Go on, tell me.

00:24:30.915 --> 00:24:31.916
Via, I’m sorry.

00:24:32.574 --> 00:24:35.368
I’m sorry because I didn’t
know how to tell you.

00:24:36.077 --> 00:24:37.412
How could you not know?

00:24:38.657 --> 00:24:42.202
I was scared you’d get
really mad and leave me.

00:24:46.588 --> 00:24:47.772
I have to admit,

00:24:47.797 --> 00:24:50.967
I can’t handle both acting
and school at the same time.

00:24:52.594 --> 00:24:55.096
That’s why my manager had me
stop attending school.

00:24:56.681 --> 00:24:58.391
They’ll just have me
attend film courses

00:24:58.391 --> 00:25:01.019
that fit my schedule.

00:25:01.895 --> 00:25:02.938
Via, I’m sorry.

00:25:03.845 --> 00:25:05.513
Sorry, I didn’t tell you sooner.

00:25:06.191 --> 00:25:09.611
I’m still thinking about whether
I’ll enroll next semester.

00:25:11.738 --> 00:25:14.407
I thought you were doing
this for your film degree?

00:25:16.284 --> 00:25:17.577
I thought you were doing this

00:25:17.577 --> 00:25:19.246
because you wanted
to be a director.

00:25:21.081 --> 00:25:23.708
I thought you didn’t
want to be an actor.

00:25:26.836 --> 00:25:28.672
Has all that changed now?

00:25:29.839 --> 00:25:30.844
Huh?

00:25:31.383 --> 00:25:34.928
Are you enjoying all the
attention they’re giving you?

00:25:36.054 --> 00:25:37.556
Via, it’s not like that.

00:25:37.556 --> 00:25:39.015
Okay? It’s not like that.

00:25:39.224 --> 00:25:40.266
So, what is it?

00:25:41.643 --> 00:25:43.603
Tell me, why?

00:25:45.063 --> 00:25:46.106
How?

00:25:47.315 --> 00:25:49.276
Kino, I want to
understand because

00:25:49.276 --> 00:25:51.194
I want to understand you.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.204
Via, let’s just talk later, okay?

00:26:01.913 --> 00:26:03.248
Why not now?

00:26:06.876 --> 00:26:08.837
I’m sorry, Via. I’m tired.

00:27:00.805 --> 00:27:02.524
@samanthavera:
Just a reminder, guys.

00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:05.719
My birthday’s on Sunday.
See you!

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.988
Happy birthday!

00:27:16.988 --> 00:27:18.073
Thank you.

00:27:18.073 --> 00:27:20.825
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you, girls.

00:27:20.825 --> 00:27:22.077
Thank you for coming.

00:27:24.204 --> 00:27:26.164
Kalix is not here. Don’t worry.

00:27:27.832 --> 00:27:29.542
It’s not like
I’m looking for him.

00:27:30.627 --> 00:27:32.379
Not looking ‘cause
you don’t want to see him,

00:27:32.379 --> 00:27:34.506
or because you do want to?

00:27:34.506 --> 00:27:36.216
I said I’m not looking for him!

00:27:37.592 --> 00:27:39.094
So? Are you introducing
someone to us?

00:27:39.594 --> 00:27:41.054
I wouldn’t want
to waste my outfit.

00:27:41.054 --> 00:27:43.431
I love this song!
Girls, let's dance!

00:27:43.431 --> 00:27:45.225
Come on! Hurry, let’s dance!

00:27:45.225 --> 00:27:46.184
Okay, fine!

00:27:46.184 --> 00:27:47.686
Come on, come on.
We’ll get to that later.

00:27:51.564 --> 00:27:52.524
Happy Birthday!

00:27:52.524 --> 00:27:53.525
Thank you.

00:28:04.911 --> 00:28:05.995
Ke! Don’t leave me!

00:28:05.995 --> 00:28:06.621
Wait!

00:28:06.621 --> 00:28:08.123
- Hey.
- Sorry, Sam. I’m leaving.

00:28:08.123 --> 00:28:08.998
- Huh? Why?
- Wait!

00:28:08.998 --> 00:28:09.916
- Hey—
- Sorry.

00:28:09.916 --> 00:28:11.793
Ke! Don’t leave me! Ke!

00:28:11.793 --> 00:28:13.545
What? What’s happening?

00:28:16.339 --> 00:28:17.132
Via?

00:28:17.132 --> 00:28:18.216
Larkin, what are you doing?

00:28:19.134 --> 00:28:20.135
What the—

00:28:20.802 --> 00:28:21.820
Hey—

00:28:22.387 --> 00:28:23.388
Wow.

00:28:23.805 --> 00:28:25.552
I’m so confused right now.

00:28:25.577 --> 00:28:27.454
Kino, let go of me!

00:28:28.024 --> 00:28:29.025
What the hell?

00:28:31.532 --> 00:28:33.205
Sir, I’ll tell you when
we’re about to leave, okay?

00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:35.150
What the hell?

00:28:37.542 --> 00:28:38.710
Via, I’m sorry.

00:28:39.028 --> 00:28:39.988
I’m really sorry.

00:28:40.319 --> 00:28:41.923
Shit. I’m sorry, please.

00:28:42.081 --> 00:28:44.292
What are you even
apologizing about?

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.036
All I ever hear
from you is “sorry"

00:28:47.036 --> 00:28:48.913
whenever we talk, Kino.

00:28:49.257 --> 00:28:51.050
Don’t you have
anything else to say?

00:28:52.959 --> 00:28:54.753
Via, I just wanted to
talk to you because

00:28:54.753 --> 00:28:58.256
I’ve been texting you, calling you,
and you’re not answering.

00:28:58.256 --> 00:29:00.675
I gave you space to calm down.

00:29:01.316 --> 00:29:03.818
But Via, it’s been weeks.

00:29:04.068 --> 00:29:06.946
So please, talk to me, Via.

00:29:07.974 --> 00:29:09.768
What? What do you want?

00:29:09.768 --> 00:29:11.936
Do you want me to enroll? Again?

00:29:11.936 --> 00:29:13.646
Fine, I’ll enroll next semester.

00:29:13.897 --> 00:29:15.190
Is it the acting thing?

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:16.649
You don’t want me
doing that anymore?

00:29:16.649 --> 00:29:18.109
Fine, I won’t take
any more projects.

00:29:18.271 --> 00:29:19.481
I’ll just finish the—

00:29:19.506 --> 00:29:21.633
What are you even talking about?

00:29:27.744 --> 00:29:28.745
Via…

00:29:31.787 --> 00:29:33.372
Via, I don’t even know anymore.

00:29:37.962 --> 00:29:39.088
Via, I’m sorry.

00:29:39.439 --> 00:29:41.858
I’m sorry, I’m just scared, okay?

00:29:41.883 --> 00:29:43.885
I’m scared that
if I do something

00:29:43.885 --> 00:29:46.304
you don’t like, you’ll leave me.

00:29:47.187 --> 00:29:48.741
This isn’t an excuse, Via.

00:29:48.766 --> 00:29:49.808
I know I messed up.

00:29:49.808 --> 00:29:51.893
I should’ve told you
even if you didn’t like it,

00:29:51.893 --> 00:29:53.895
even if you didn’t
want to hear it.

00:29:57.232 --> 00:29:58.316
But Via…

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:00.401
What about me?

00:30:02.278 --> 00:30:03.648
This is what I want.

00:30:14.874 --> 00:30:17.252
Why do I always
stop you from thriving?

00:30:17.806 --> 00:30:20.563
I’m joining the photojournalism
club next school year.

00:30:20.681 --> 00:30:23.476
Aside from music,
I like cameras too.

00:30:26.344 --> 00:30:29.138
Why do I always project
my scars onto you?

00:30:29.806 --> 00:30:31.140
Kino, you’re lucky,
you know that?

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:34.405
You already know what you
want to do in life,

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:36.039
and you’re good at everything.

00:30:36.734 --> 00:30:38.360
If you weren’t around,

00:30:38.385 --> 00:30:40.011
I probably wouldn’t
know what to do either.

00:30:40.036 --> 00:30:41.580
Of course you would.

00:30:41.605 --> 00:30:43.273
When you become an actor,

00:30:43.298 --> 00:30:44.633
I might actually be
your number one fan.

00:30:46.385 --> 00:30:49.008
Why do I keep forcing
what I want on you?

00:31:03.656 --> 00:31:04.719
I’m sorry.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.617
I just wanted you
to finish school.

00:31:14.392 --> 00:31:17.270
I thought that’s what you wanted.

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:22.191
But—

00:31:24.652 --> 00:31:26.988
I didn’t realize
I was stopping you

00:31:26.988 --> 00:31:29.407
from doing the things
you want to do.

00:31:36.944 --> 00:31:38.905
Kino, I’m sorry.

00:31:40.627 --> 00:31:42.754
I’m sorry.

00:31:44.088 --> 00:31:46.674
I’m sorry you’re struggling.

00:31:46.674 --> 00:31:50.484
I’m sorry that the way
I love hurts. I’m sorry.

00:32:04.025 --> 00:32:05.735
Via, I know what
I did was wrong.

00:32:05.735 --> 00:32:08.029
I should’ve told you
from the very beginning.

00:32:08.613 --> 00:32:11.783
I know I’ve hurt you a lot.

00:32:12.825 --> 00:32:14.452
But I’m telling you right now,

00:32:14.452 --> 00:32:16.371
I won’t make
promises anymore, okay?

00:32:17.121 --> 00:32:18.623
I’ll just tell you everything.

00:32:18.623 --> 00:32:21.542
Whatever you want to know,
whatever’s happening to me.

00:32:21.542 --> 00:32:24.253
I’ll tell you everything.
Just please, don’t leave me.

00:32:33.972 --> 00:32:37.225
I won’t rely
on your words anymore.

00:32:40.603 --> 00:32:42.547
But I’ll believe you.

00:32:48.778 --> 00:32:51.155
Do you really like
what you’re doing?

00:32:59.956 --> 00:33:02.125
I’m not leaving your side.

00:33:05.545 --> 00:33:07.755
I’ll trust you,

00:33:08.719 --> 00:33:11.469
but Kino, you have
to trust me too, okay?

00:33:17.265 --> 00:33:20.435
Promise me too
that you’ll never think

00:33:20.435 --> 00:33:22.766
that you’re a burden
to what I’m doing.

00:33:23.396 --> 00:33:25.305
Because you’re not, Via. Okay?

00:33:50.764 --> 00:33:54.267
After all that,
Arkin and I were okay again.

00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:58.845
Just like he promised,
he told me everything.

00:33:59.328 --> 00:34:01.859
And slowly,
my trust in him came back.

00:34:02.812 --> 00:34:06.441
The only problem was,
he told me literally everything.

00:34:09.025 --> 00:34:10.610
Months passed,

00:34:11.063 --> 00:34:13.446
and Kino’s projects kept
coming one after another.

00:34:13.695 --> 00:34:16.883
So did the big
milestones in his life.

00:34:17.071 --> 00:34:19.157
Like his new car.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:25.666
What’s up, Via?

00:34:25.666 --> 00:34:27.919
Check out my new condo.

00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:30.713
It’s so nice here. It’s huge!

00:34:31.406 --> 00:34:34.201
And look at this,

00:34:34.226 --> 00:34:37.426
the sofa’s super relaxing.

00:34:37.451 --> 00:34:38.648
There’s a bit of
an overlooking view, too.

00:34:39.106 --> 00:34:41.400
Even when he moved
into his new condo unit,

00:34:42.058 --> 00:34:46.734
he always made sure that
even if we rarely saw each other,

00:34:46.759 --> 00:34:48.883
I was still part of his success.

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:53.781
I’m happy for everything
he’s achieving.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:00.221
But am I happy with
my own achievements?

00:35:10.986 --> 00:35:12.237
You can do this.

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:14.128
You really can.

00:35:15.258 --> 00:35:16.717
You can do this.

00:35:25.246 --> 00:35:26.539
You got this.

00:35:46.914 --> 00:35:48.124
Via, you’re okay.

00:35:48.124 --> 00:35:50.168
Don’t let this get to you.
You’re fine.

00:35:50.168 --> 00:35:51.627
You can do this.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:13.124
I’m getting excited
about our project.

00:36:13.149 --> 00:36:18.863
We’re supposed to
draw our dream project.

00:36:19.113 --> 00:36:22.158
I already have so many ideas!

00:36:22.158 --> 00:36:25.494
Me? I want my own
architecture firm.

00:36:25.786 --> 00:36:26.537
Wow!

00:36:26.537 --> 00:36:28.706
Floor-to-ceiling windows, modern.

00:36:28.706 --> 00:36:29.707
Yes.

00:36:29.707 --> 00:36:31.626
And a garden on the rooftop.

00:36:31.626 --> 00:36:34.003
Actually, that sounds so nice!

00:36:34.003 --> 00:36:40.968
As for me, I want to do
my dream house, ranch-style.

00:36:40.968 --> 00:36:45.640
So it feels cozy, warm, and—

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.726
an open floor layout,
so while I’m cooking

00:36:48.726 --> 00:36:51.312
I can see my
husband and my kids.

00:36:51.312 --> 00:36:53.231
Like, hi! Just like that!

00:36:53.231 --> 00:36:54.190
Right?

00:36:55.816 --> 00:36:57.235
What about you, Via?

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.952
That’s how many now?

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:08.287
I don’t know.

00:37:08.287 --> 00:37:09.997
I don’t even know
what to do anymore.

00:37:09.997 --> 00:37:14.252
I don’t even know
what I really want.

00:37:14.252 --> 00:37:16.170
I don’t even have
a dream project yet.

00:37:16.462 --> 00:37:18.965
Don’t worry. It will come.

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:20.023
Right.

00:37:20.048 --> 00:37:21.800
Here, this might help
you get motivated.

00:37:21.926 --> 00:37:23.052
Just think that one day,

00:37:23.052 --> 00:37:25.179
we’ll be designing the buildings
here in the Philippines.

00:37:25.846 --> 00:37:27.701
And people are gonna say,

00:37:27.726 --> 00:37:31.686
“that was designed by
Architect Valeria, Architect Ynares,

00:37:31.686 --> 00:37:33.020
and Architect—

00:37:33.222 --> 00:37:34.807
- Diaz.”
- Diaz.

00:37:35.356 --> 00:37:36.983
So exciting, right?

00:37:36.983 --> 00:37:38.567
Aren’t you excited, Via?

00:37:38.567 --> 00:37:39.648
Aren’t you?

00:37:41.946 --> 00:37:43.364
I don’t know. I feel like—

00:37:43.854 --> 00:37:46.731
I feel like I kind of regret
taking this course.

00:37:48.047 --> 00:37:49.304
You know what I mean?

00:37:49.537 --> 00:37:51.580
It’s like I’m only finishing it
because I have to.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.165
I’m just forcing
myself at this point.

00:37:53.165 --> 00:37:54.834
I don’t want to
waste the tuition.

00:37:55.166 --> 00:37:57.968
I don’t want to waste Papa
and my aunt’s savings too.

00:38:02.174 --> 00:38:04.635
Via, come on. I understand you.

00:38:04.635 --> 00:38:07.179
Our program is really hard.
Even I’m struggling.

00:38:07.179 --> 00:38:09.181
But I know you can do it.

00:38:09.181 --> 00:38:12.560
Your ideas and your
plates are really good.

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.398
Your work is so neat.
So polished.

00:38:17.398 --> 00:38:20.276
Honestly, you’re even
better than me

00:38:20.276 --> 00:38:21.527
at being an architect.

00:38:21.736 --> 00:38:24.280
And that’s why we told you
we’d support you.

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:25.906
You can do it.

00:38:25.906 --> 00:38:28.784
The three of us can do it
as long as we stick together.

00:38:28.784 --> 00:38:31.287
Until we graduate.

00:38:31.707 --> 00:38:37.691
Until we get our licenses and
become successful architects.

00:38:38.044 --> 00:38:39.045
Right?

00:38:39.879 --> 00:38:41.672
Thank you, really.

00:38:42.631 --> 00:38:43.924
You guys help me so much.

00:38:43.924 --> 00:38:47.762
I can’t imagine doing
this without you.

00:38:49.221 --> 00:38:50.014
Let’s hug.

00:38:50.014 --> 00:38:51.265
Oh my gosh.

00:38:52.975 --> 00:38:54.101
We got this.

00:38:54.101 --> 00:38:55.728
The three of us
can definitely do this.

00:38:55.728 --> 00:38:57.897
Yes! Fight!

00:38:59.106 --> 00:39:00.223
Fight.

00:39:00.858 --> 00:39:03.569
Hey guys, they said Clea’s
getting a new partner.

00:39:03.569 --> 00:39:07.448
Some new actor who already
has a bunch of projects.

00:39:07.448 --> 00:39:08.699
Who?

00:39:09.658 --> 00:39:10.659
Larkin?

00:39:10.659 --> 00:39:11.619
Larkin Sanchez.

00:39:11.619 --> 00:39:13.184
I think they’re trying
to boost his popularity.

00:39:13.454 --> 00:39:16.040
I read about that too.
It’s not official yet.

00:39:16.248 --> 00:39:20.795
Yeah, but look at
everyone’s reactions online.

00:39:21.045 --> 00:39:22.671
The edits of them together
already have so many views.

00:39:22.671 --> 00:39:25.883
And their pairing in that series
is starting to blow up, too.

00:39:26.217 --> 00:39:30.429
Their chemistry is crazy,
even in their tiny scenes. Look.

00:39:30.429 --> 00:39:31.972
I mean, I’m a fan of Clea too,

00:39:31.972 --> 00:39:33.949
but I hope she doesn’t
get a love team.

00:39:33.974 --> 00:39:35.726
She’s fine on her own.

00:39:36.102 --> 00:39:38.354
Why don’t you want
her in a love team?

00:39:38.354 --> 00:39:39.647
I just don’t.

00:39:40.074 --> 00:39:42.316
There’s a high chance
she might catch feelings

00:39:42.316 --> 00:39:43.684
for her love team partner.

00:39:44.193 --> 00:39:47.488
Enough with these love teams
turning into real-life couples.

00:39:47.488 --> 00:39:50.074
Wow, you’re such
a possessive fan.

00:39:50.074 --> 00:39:52.618
Fine, okay. No more. I’ll stop.

00:39:52.618 --> 00:39:54.078
There, look. Deleted.

00:39:54.078 --> 00:39:55.287
No more.

00:39:56.784 --> 00:39:59.121
Why am I even feeling like this?

00:39:59.583 --> 00:40:01.988
I don’t have the
right to be jealous.

00:40:03.129 --> 00:40:04.964
We’re just friends.

00:40:17.935 --> 00:40:20.479
This concert hall
is my dream project.

00:40:20.646 --> 00:40:23.023
My classmates all chose
houses or office buildings

00:40:23.023 --> 00:40:24.567
for their dream projects.

00:40:24.567 --> 00:40:26.444
But this is mine.

00:40:27.361 --> 00:40:28.362
It’s okay, right?

00:40:28.863 --> 00:40:29.864
Does it look good?

00:40:39.081 --> 00:40:40.082
Are you okay?

00:40:49.258 --> 00:40:50.843
They’re pairing me with someone.

00:40:52.261 --> 00:40:53.262
Pairing?

00:40:55.181 --> 00:40:58.684
Remember I told you that
after my series project,

00:40:59.185 --> 00:41:00.436
I’d be doing a movie?

00:41:01.645 --> 00:41:03.230
That movie is
finally pushing through.

00:41:04.732 --> 00:41:05.782
Really?

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:07.401
Then congrats!

00:41:09.612 --> 00:41:11.822
Why do you look like
you’re not happy, though?

00:41:15.868 --> 00:41:19.121
Management wants to try
pairing me with a love interest.

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:22.208
And if people like it,

00:41:23.334 --> 00:41:25.044
they might make us
an official love team.

00:41:25.241 --> 00:41:26.367
I don’t want that.

00:41:31.425 --> 00:41:33.260
But that’s good for your career.

00:41:34.512 --> 00:41:35.971
Who are they pairing you with?

00:41:37.097 --> 00:41:38.098
Clea.

00:41:40.726 --> 00:41:42.019
Clea Aguilar?

00:41:42.811 --> 00:41:44.396
You don’t know
Clea Zorel Aguilar?

00:41:44.647 --> 00:41:46.690
That’s the former child star.

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:48.567
We’re basically the same age.

00:41:48.567 --> 00:41:50.069
But she’s super famous now.

00:41:51.654 --> 00:41:52.747
Yeah.

00:41:53.989 --> 00:41:56.492
She’s one of the most popular
actresses right now, right?

00:41:57.326 --> 00:41:58.744
That’s really good for you.

00:41:58.744 --> 00:42:00.538
It’ll help your career a lot.

00:42:01.956 --> 00:42:03.916
And it’s just a love team.

00:42:03.916 --> 00:42:06.585
You don’t actually have
to date her in real life.

00:42:09.451 --> 00:42:10.619
That’s true.

00:42:11.465 --> 00:42:13.801
And it’s not like
I have a choice anyway.

00:42:13.801 --> 00:42:15.928
I just follow whatever
my manager tells me.

00:42:16.887 --> 00:42:19.265
It’s a big deal for your career.

00:42:19.452 --> 00:42:21.120
And if you think about it,

00:42:21.559 --> 00:42:25.396
all of this is to help you
reach your dreams.

00:42:27.988 --> 00:42:29.450
Are you really okay with it?

00:42:33.904 --> 00:42:35.114
Of course.

00:42:35.447 --> 00:42:38.075
Didn’t I tell you I’ll support
you in everything?

00:42:38.521 --> 00:42:41.399
I’m excited to see you
reach your dreams.

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:45.249
Via, I’m saying
sorry in advance, okay?

00:42:45.249 --> 00:42:49.920
I might get really busy
in the next few weeks.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.631
Once we start rolling,
it’s nonstop.

00:42:53.603 --> 00:42:56.536
He’ll be with Clea
the whole day on set.

00:42:58.804 --> 00:43:00.055
Well…

00:43:01.015 --> 00:43:05.311
Then let’s just meet
on your day off.

00:43:06.729 --> 00:43:08.272
Sure, let’s do that.

00:43:08.689 --> 00:43:10.774
Sometimes my manager
makes me go to the gym too.

00:43:10.774 --> 00:43:13.193
But Sevi goes with me,
so don’t worry.

00:43:16.614 --> 00:43:18.616
Don’t worry about me, Kino.

00:43:20.409 --> 00:43:22.411
I’m just here to support you.

00:43:22.703 --> 00:43:23.954
Thank you, Via.

00:43:48.312 --> 00:43:49.730
They don’t even look
good together.

00:43:49.878 --> 00:43:51.171
What did you say?

00:43:52.544 --> 00:43:53.606
Nothing!

00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:55.090
I didn’t say anything.

00:43:55.957 --> 00:43:57.046
By the way, where’s Arkin?

00:43:57.071 --> 00:43:58.572
He hasn’t been showing up.

00:43:59.615 --> 00:44:00.699
He’s busy.

00:44:00.699 --> 00:44:03.535
If it’s not work,
he’s at the gym with Sevi.

00:44:03.535 --> 00:44:05.913
Wow, Sevi’s stealing your title.

00:44:05.913 --> 00:44:07.706
He’s the new best friend.

00:44:09.249 --> 00:44:10.551
Hey.

00:44:11.219 --> 00:44:12.426
Now you—

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:19.145
Finally, I’m free.
Let’s go to Sunken?

00:44:19.674 --> 00:44:20.800
Shooting starts
again tomorrow.

00:44:21.512 --> 00:44:23.389
I’m on my way.

00:44:23.935 --> 00:44:26.313
Luna, Ke, I’ll go ahead, okay?

00:44:26.338 --> 00:44:29.328
Kino texted me. He’s free,
so we’re meeting later.

00:44:29.353 --> 00:44:30.312
Okay.

00:44:30.312 --> 00:44:32.481
And can you put my t-square
in the locker, please?

00:44:32.481 --> 00:44:35.109
- Bye!
- All right, take care. Hey!

00:44:38.362 --> 00:44:39.363
- Via!
- Kino.

00:44:41.281 --> 00:44:42.825
How are you? You okay?

00:44:51.834 --> 00:44:54.628
Wow, you’re wearing lip tint.

00:44:56.463 --> 00:44:58.465
Is only Clea allowed to wear lip tint?

00:44:59.216 --> 00:45:00.509
You’re so annoying.

00:45:02.902 --> 00:45:04.195
Why am I annoying?

00:45:14.541 --> 00:45:16.309
Your hair’s a mess again.

00:45:16.734 --> 00:45:18.485
Come here, I’ll tie it.

00:45:25.701 --> 00:45:26.994
Can you do it?

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.301
There.

00:45:44.833 --> 00:45:46.001
Thanks.

00:45:47.014 --> 00:45:49.808
So, why’d you ask me
to meet you today?

00:45:52.227 --> 00:45:53.937
Via, I’m releasing a single.

00:45:54.396 --> 00:45:56.607
Remember the song
I was writing before?

00:45:57.649 --> 00:45:58.650
I finished it.

00:45:59.404 --> 00:46:00.405
I want you to hear it.

00:46:01.921 --> 00:46:03.214
Listen carefully, okay?

00:46:10.177 --> 00:46:15.265

What’s it for?

00:48:17.623 --> 00:48:19.875
I got inspired by my friend.

00:48:19.875 --> 00:48:22.711
He wanted to
confess his feelings

00:48:22.711 --> 00:48:25.172
but couldn’t
because they’re friends.

00:48:25.172 --> 00:48:26.673
Just have a crush on me instead,

00:48:26.867 --> 00:48:28.661
since I have a crush
on you anyway.

00:48:29.635 --> 00:48:30.636
Via…

00:48:32.596 --> 00:48:34.389
I think I have feelings for you.

00:48:42.814 --> 00:48:44.066
How was it?

00:48:49.571 --> 00:48:50.572
Huh?

00:48:54.159 --> 00:48:55.160
It’s good.

00:48:56.244 --> 00:48:57.371
The song’s good.

00:48:57.704 --> 00:49:00.832
And your singing,
it’s really good too.

00:49:01.166 --> 00:49:06.838
It’s about someone
who wants to be honest

00:49:06.838 --> 00:49:08.048
about how they feel.

00:49:08.048 --> 00:49:10.300
Someone who wants to confess
to their friend, right?

00:49:10.884 --> 00:49:11.885
Why—

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:17.557
Why did you write
a song like that?

00:49:20.435 --> 00:49:23.146
Via, are you okay?
Your face is red.

00:49:23.146 --> 00:49:24.731
- Huh?
- Are you okay?

00:49:25.023 --> 00:49:27.985
Me? No. I’m fine.
It’s just hot.

00:49:31.238 --> 00:49:34.157
It’s hot, and the
sun’s about to set.

00:49:34.157 --> 00:49:36.451
I still have to commute home.

00:49:36.451 --> 00:49:38.453
It might get too late, Kino.

00:49:38.453 --> 00:49:40.914
There’s traffic, it’ll get dark.
Come on, let’s go.

00:49:41.999 --> 00:49:43.083
Via, wait.

00:49:44.751 --> 00:49:45.794
So…

00:49:49.423 --> 00:49:50.716
How was the song?

00:49:54.011 --> 00:49:56.096
Did you understand it?

00:49:56.596 --> 00:49:57.431
Of course.

00:49:57.764 --> 00:49:59.307
And the song is good.

00:50:00.183 --> 00:50:01.518
It’s really good.

00:50:02.227 --> 00:50:05.564
It’s about admitting their
feelings to their friend, right?

00:50:05.564 --> 00:50:09.776
But they're scared it might
ruin the friendship.

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:13.163
He confessed, right?

00:50:14.072 --> 00:50:16.074
What am I even
supposed to say?

00:50:16.363 --> 00:50:18.949
Can I really risk everything
we’ve been through?

00:50:19.428 --> 00:50:21.561
What if we break up?

00:50:21.586 --> 00:50:23.838
What’ll happen
to our friendship?

00:50:27.544 --> 00:50:28.545
And yeah.

00:50:29.296 --> 00:50:30.756
It’s a really good song.

00:50:31.048 --> 00:50:32.049
Let’s go.

00:50:32.074 --> 00:50:33.492
Via, I love you.

00:50:41.058 --> 00:50:42.642
Not just as a friend.

00:50:43.852 --> 00:50:45.437
I know you already know that,

00:50:45.812 --> 00:50:48.190
so why are you
still avoiding it?

00:50:51.276 --> 00:50:52.652
I already know what
you’re going to say.

00:50:52.652 --> 00:50:54.613
If you’re just going to
thank me, I don’t need it.

00:50:56.198 --> 00:50:58.194
What do you
even want me to say?

00:50:58.241 --> 00:50:59.910
What should I even say?

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:01.620
Kino, I don’t know
what to do anymore.

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:03.580
I don’t know what
to say because,

00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:05.665
why did you have
to say that before?

00:51:05.665 --> 00:51:07.709
Why do you still
have to say it now?

00:51:07.709 --> 00:51:08.710
Look at me, even now,

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:10.545
I don’t know what
I’m supposed to feel.

00:51:10.545 --> 00:51:12.506
I don’t know what I really feel.

00:51:13.465 --> 00:51:15.008
Damn it, Larkin.

00:51:17.071 --> 00:51:18.489
How do you really feel?

00:51:19.054 --> 00:51:20.055
Do you love me?

00:51:20.055 --> 00:51:21.348
Of course!

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:28.605
We’re friends, right?

00:51:36.988 --> 00:51:38.907
Come on, Via. Let’s go home.

00:51:48.324 --> 00:51:50.034
Come on.
I’ll bring you home.

00:51:50.317 --> 00:51:52.110
I also want to see
Papa and the kids.

00:52:00.846 --> 00:52:02.097
We’re here!

00:52:02.097 --> 00:52:02.973
Hi, Pa.

00:52:02.973 --> 00:52:04.057
- Hi, Via!
- Hey.

00:52:04.057 --> 00:52:04.933
Pa.

00:52:04.933 --> 00:52:05.725
- Arkin!
- Arkin!

00:52:05.725 --> 00:52:06.977
Hi!

00:52:07.269 --> 00:52:08.145
- Long time no see.
- Arkin!

00:52:08.145 --> 00:52:09.229
- Oh, Arkin!
- Papa.

00:52:09.229 --> 00:52:10.397
Glad you came to visit.

00:52:10.519 --> 00:52:12.396
Pa, I’ll sleep here
tonight, okay?

00:52:12.421 --> 00:52:14.818
But I’ll leave early tomorrow
since I have a shoot.

00:52:14.818 --> 00:52:17.445
Sure thing. You’re really
famous now, huh?

00:52:17.904 --> 00:52:20.657
Just don’t forget to
take care of yourself, okay?

00:52:20.657 --> 00:52:21.241
Yes, Pa.

00:52:21.241 --> 00:52:22.909
Oh, wait. Via, I cooked.

00:52:22.909 --> 00:52:24.077
You two eat first, okay?

00:52:24.077 --> 00:52:26.204
Sure, Pa. Let me
help you. I’ll do it.

00:52:26.204 --> 00:52:28.165
No, no. I’m fine. I got this.

00:52:29.065 --> 00:52:30.066
Okay.

00:52:31.099 --> 00:52:34.144
- So, how have you been?
- Wow, Arkin, it’s been a while, right?

00:52:34.546 --> 00:52:36.923
But we always see you on TV.

00:52:37.086 --> 00:52:38.338
How is it again?

00:52:39.801 --> 00:52:41.636
Refreshing!

00:52:42.429 --> 00:52:45.390
You know, Arkin, I think
I could be on TV too.

00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:46.210
Go ahead.

00:52:46.235 --> 00:52:47.945
Refreshing!

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:50.303
It should be
a little gentler, like this.

00:52:51.646 --> 00:52:52.564
Refreshing.

00:52:52.564 --> 00:52:54.274
That’s how it
should be, you guys!

00:52:54.274 --> 00:52:57.652
Since you watch
my shows and my ads,

00:52:58.361 --> 00:52:59.779
I brought something
for you guys.

00:53:00.238 --> 00:53:01.364
Souvenirs!

00:53:01.364 --> 00:53:02.115
Wow!

00:53:02.115 --> 00:53:03.158
- Here’s yours.
- That’s a lot, Arkin.

00:53:03.158 --> 00:53:04.159
These are toys.

00:53:04.159 --> 00:53:05.410
Here are snacks.

00:53:05.410 --> 00:53:07.162
- This one too.
- Chocolates!

00:53:07.162 --> 00:53:08.914
Not now, okay? After dinner.

00:53:08.914 --> 00:53:10.707
This is my favorite!

00:53:10.707 --> 00:53:12.584
- Thank you, Arkin.
- Of course, I know. I know you well.

00:53:12.584 --> 00:53:13.627
- Here, this one’s for you.
- Look at this.

00:53:13.627 --> 00:53:14.711
- Thank you, Arkin!
- And this one, for you. Look.

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:17.797
Can’t we just stay
like this? Happy.

00:53:17.797 --> 00:53:22.636
Uncomplicated.
Not ruining our friendship…

00:53:31.384 --> 00:53:32.385
Via?

00:53:41.696 --> 00:53:43.073
That’s my shirt.

00:53:46.927 --> 00:53:47.969
Oh my gosh.

00:53:47.994 --> 00:53:49.037
What do you want me to do?

00:53:49.037 --> 00:53:51.957
That was the first thing
I grabbed from the cabinet.

00:53:51.957 --> 00:53:54.042
Fine, fine, I’ll change—

00:53:54.042 --> 00:53:55.627
- I’ll return it to you.
- No, don’t. It’s fine.

00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:16.815
Move over.

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:26.241
Via, we have a kissing
scene in our movie.

00:54:30.537 --> 00:54:31.538
So what?

00:54:32.038 --> 00:54:33.331
You’ve never had
your first kiss yet.

00:54:33.331 --> 00:54:35.333
Perfect timing, Clea’s there.
Don’t you want that?

00:54:37.303 --> 00:54:38.930
Via, I want it to be with you.

00:54:48.661 --> 00:54:49.913
Why me?

00:54:50.849 --> 00:54:52.017
I don’t want to.

00:54:52.461 --> 00:54:54.255
Not me. Just choose Clea.
I don’t know how.

00:54:59.524 --> 00:55:00.984
Why are you laughing?

00:55:00.984 --> 00:55:02.861
What’s funny? I’m serious.

00:55:02.861 --> 00:55:04.279
Clea’s right there.

00:55:05.155 --> 00:55:07.032
I’m sure she’s
better at it than I am.

00:55:07.032 --> 00:55:08.116
Just choose Clea.

00:55:08.116 --> 00:55:09.826
- Why?
- What?

00:55:09.826 --> 00:55:11.494
Is Clea the one I like?

00:55:17.032 --> 00:55:18.451
Admit it, Via.

00:55:18.835 --> 00:55:20.420
You’re falling for me.

00:55:24.758 --> 00:55:26.676
As if. Excuse me.

00:55:33.808 --> 00:55:35.018
You don’t want to admit it?

00:55:39.147 --> 00:55:41.316
Push me away if you’re
not in love with me.

00:56:44.671 --> 00:56:45.744
What about you?

00:56:46.047 --> 00:56:48.758
Don’t you like
anyone you work with?

00:56:49.206 --> 00:56:51.375
You’re surrounded by
so many pretty girls.

00:56:54.919 --> 00:56:56.796
Why are you asking that?

00:57:04.441 --> 00:57:05.817
Just kidding.

00:57:06.568 --> 00:57:07.610
No.

00:57:07.610 --> 00:57:09.279
I don’t like anyone there.

00:57:09.821 --> 00:57:11.573
You? Do you like anyone?

00:57:14.842 --> 00:57:17.721
You… You’re the one I like.

00:57:17.993 --> 00:57:21.914
But it can’t happen,
so being friends is fine.

00:57:25.619 --> 00:57:27.788
Because I like you.

00:57:40.185 --> 00:57:42.312
Whether we stay friends
or whatever we become,

00:57:42.312 --> 00:57:44.731
nothing’s going to
change between us, right?

00:57:44.731 --> 00:57:48.318
Here comes
the Box Office King!

00:57:48.318 --> 00:57:49.068
Oh my gosh, Via,

00:57:49.068 --> 00:57:50.695
they said there’s
a kissing scene.

00:57:51.488 --> 00:57:54.657
Here with us today is
the most handsome of them all,

00:57:54.657 --> 00:57:57.076
Mr. Larkin Sanchez.

00:57:57.076 --> 00:57:59.746
So, to answer
everyone’s question,

00:57:59.746 --> 00:58:02.790
is Larkin Sanchez still single?

00:58:04.078 --> 00:58:05.752
Oh, so you’re Rhythmics too?

00:58:06.948 --> 00:58:08.324
What are your stan accounts?

00:58:08.349 --> 00:58:09.447
We’ll follow you.

00:58:09.506 --> 00:58:10.882
Is that required?

00:58:11.299 --> 00:58:12.550
Kino, you know what?

00:58:13.843 --> 00:58:15.470
I want to keep you
all to myself,

00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:16.971
away from your fangirls.

00:58:18.324 --> 00:58:20.838
But I know
that’s part of your job.

00:58:26.731 --> 00:58:28.650
Why do I even love you?

00:58:28.942 --> 00:58:29.943
She just keeps smiling.

00:58:29.943 --> 00:58:31.819
I bet she’s just in love.

00:58:31.819 --> 00:58:33.321
Can we talk?

00:58:34.707 --> 00:58:37.043
You don’t want us
to be in a relationship?
