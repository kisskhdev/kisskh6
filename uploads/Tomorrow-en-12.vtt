WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000

00:00:25.313 --> 00:00:26.961
Kino, are you going
to do something to me?

00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:28.129
So I’m ready if—

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:29.129
Ready for what?

00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:31.425
For that, you know. For—

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:32.476
- You know what I mean.
- For sex?

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:34.201
- Huh? Kino!
- Via!

00:00:34.588 --> 00:00:36.131
It’s better to be prepared.

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:40.499
What matters is that
both you and Arkin

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:42.000
have a great first time.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.346
I only love you.
You know that, right?

00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:51.698
I’m really sorry about the news.

00:00:52.188 --> 00:00:53.981
So what, you’re together now?

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.190
What happens now?

00:00:56.204 --> 00:00:57.705
Are you going to act
like you’re together?

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.731
You’ll go out, go on dates,
be sweet, hug, kiss, like that?

00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:03.732
So whatever we do,

00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:05.192
you’re going to do it
with her too, is that it?

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.860
Via, I’d understand if—

00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:10.238
you can’t support me
on this anymore.

00:01:10.238 --> 00:01:11.323
No, Kino.

00:01:11.823 --> 00:01:14.284
Even if this breaks me,
even if I get hurt by this.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.993
It’s okay. I’ll endure it.

00:01:17.898 --> 00:01:20.025
I don’t want to get
caught up in his spotlight.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.195
I’ll stay standing
behind his shadow.

00:02:45.805 --> 00:02:47.012
Via, just a little more.

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:49.266
Just a little more.

00:02:49.774 --> 00:02:51.401
Even if it’s hard, even
if it feels really hard,

00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:52.869
just a little more.
You can do this.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.092
Once you pass this,
it’s Christmas break.

00:02:55.598 --> 00:02:57.886
You’ll finally be able to rest,
you can do this.

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:17.613
Hello.

00:03:18.013 --> 00:03:19.598
Oh, hello!

00:03:20.193 --> 00:03:21.611
Why did you call?

00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:24.016
Sorry, did I interrupt
your studying?

00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:26.414
Not really.

00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:27.862
How are you?

00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:33.573
I’m okay.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.099
I’m just really exhausted.

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.310
It feels like even after
I finish my plates,

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.812
there’s still so much
I need to read.

00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:44.481
I don’t know what to do
anymore or what to prioritize.

00:03:44.481 --> 00:03:46.567
None of it is getting in my head.

00:03:46.915 --> 00:03:48.599
I’m sure you, of all people,
can handle it.

00:03:49.013 --> 00:03:50.070
Just hang in there a bit more,

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.488
Christmas break is coming.

00:03:51.513 --> 00:03:53.108
You’ll get to rest

00:03:53.542 --> 00:03:56.577
and we’ll be together every day.

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:58.255
Every day?

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.231
Really? Aren’t you going
to be busy then?

00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:03.649
Won’t you have any shoots?

00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:05.703
All done.
We did them in advance.

00:04:05.984 --> 00:04:07.789
The staff needs a break, too.

00:04:08.674 --> 00:04:10.225
By the way, Mama said

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:14.604
she wants to spend Christmas
and New Year with you at the house.

00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:17.856
Really? Okay,
I’ll tell my family.

00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:19.316
They’ll like that.

00:04:19.316 --> 00:04:21.222
I’m sure they’ll be happy.
They’ll be excited.

00:04:23.195 --> 00:04:24.897
Via, I have good news.

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:28.222
My album is coming out. Finally!

00:04:28.417 --> 00:04:30.173
You’re coming to
my launch, okay?

00:04:30.198 --> 00:04:32.771
What? Really?

00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:34.649
Kino, congratulations!

00:04:35.077 --> 00:04:36.077
When is it?

00:04:37.205 --> 00:04:38.820
First weekend after New Year.

00:04:39.294 --> 00:04:40.781
You have to be there, okay?

00:04:41.755 --> 00:04:42.922
Of course.

00:04:43.402 --> 00:04:44.419
Give me a sample.

00:04:45.342 --> 00:04:46.426
I already sang it to you before.

00:04:46.426 --> 00:04:47.844
You probably just
don’t remember.

00:04:48.065 --> 00:04:49.706
The title of the lead single is called,

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:51.834
My Favorite Movie.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.483
Oh. What’s it about?

00:04:54.768 --> 00:04:55.815
It’s about you.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.940
Really?

00:04:59.325 --> 00:05:00.465
About me?

00:05:01.186 --> 00:05:02.396
You’re probably
just saying that

00:05:02.396 --> 00:05:04.606
because it’s been a while
since we last saw each other.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.558
Via, you really are my inspiration.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.560
Listen closely to
it at the launch.

00:05:11.922 --> 00:05:12.922
Okay.

00:05:12.927 --> 00:05:14.481
Larkin, let’s resume.

00:05:14.493 --> 00:05:16.250
Okay, I’ll head back
to recording now.

00:05:17.095 --> 00:05:19.013
Finish what you’re studying.

00:05:19.222 --> 00:05:20.406
Two weeks from now,

00:05:20.848 --> 00:05:22.225
we’ll be together again.

00:05:22.225 --> 00:05:23.768
Okay. Take care.

00:05:40.204 --> 00:05:41.330
I can do this!

00:05:41.751 --> 00:05:42.877
I can do this!

00:05:43.518 --> 00:05:44.644
I can do this!

00:05:48.983 --> 00:05:50.859
Put the gifts there together.

00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:52.111
Yes, okay.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.198
- Merry Christmas, everybody!
- Merry Christmas, Arkin!

00:05:55.198 --> 00:05:56.449
I brought gifts for all of you!

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:57.868
- Wow!
- Thank you, Arkin!

00:05:57.868 --> 00:05:59.202
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Arkin.

00:05:59.202 --> 00:06:00.569
I’m not Arkin, I’m Santa!

00:06:00.725 --> 00:06:01.725
Now choose.

00:06:02.351 --> 00:06:03.351
- You?
- I’ll take this.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.363
And you?

00:06:04.365 --> 00:06:05.867
- Hey, you took the one with the star.
- It’s so cute!

00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:07.279
Here. This one’s yours.

00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:09.566
- Thank you so much.
- We’re a match.

00:06:09.572 --> 00:06:12.479
Mira, can I open my gifts now?

00:06:12.488 --> 00:06:14.898
Later, you’re so excited.

00:06:15.636 --> 00:06:16.803
I’m sorry, Mira.

00:06:16.803 --> 00:06:18.388
It’s just that,

00:06:18.388 --> 00:06:21.475
not everyone gets gifts
from their crush like you.

00:06:22.696 --> 00:06:23.696
Hey.

00:06:24.696 --> 00:06:25.943
You’re crushing
on someone now?

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.327
No, Via.

00:06:28.327 --> 00:06:30.746
- She is.
- Hey, I don’t have a crush.

00:06:30.746 --> 00:06:32.164
They’re just teasing me.

00:06:32.164 --> 00:06:33.898
I don’t have a crush,
I promise.

00:06:34.157 --> 00:06:35.908
You know, there’s nothing
wrong with having a crush.

00:06:35.933 --> 00:06:39.678
I even had a crush
on Via from way back.

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:41.610
We were this small then.

00:06:43.005 --> 00:06:44.923
Even Aidan has a girlfriend.

00:06:44.923 --> 00:06:46.089
Hey. What are you saying?

00:06:46.102 --> 00:06:47.478
I don’t have any,
you ugly girl!

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.298
Hey, Aidan.
Watch your mouth.

00:06:50.555 --> 00:06:52.890
Be careful with what
you say to your sisters.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.893
Or Santa won’t give you a gift.

00:06:56.185 --> 00:06:57.353
Sorry, Via.

00:06:57.353 --> 00:07:00.273
Santa? I don’t think
Santa gave these.

00:07:00.273 --> 00:07:03.901
I saw Papa earlier,
he was carrying the gifts.

00:07:07.113 --> 00:07:08.219
Wow.

00:07:08.698 --> 00:07:10.180
I feel like I don’t want
kids anymore.

00:07:11.532 --> 00:07:12.532
I do.

00:07:13.586 --> 00:07:15.310
I wonder how many
kids we’ll have, Via.

00:07:16.364 --> 00:07:19.523
So, Via, how many will it be?

00:07:20.544 --> 00:07:21.712
I guess two.

00:07:21.712 --> 00:07:22.712
I’m guessing three.

00:07:22.718 --> 00:07:24.887
Merry Christmas, guys!

00:07:24.887 --> 00:07:26.388
- Hi, Auntie!
- Hello.

00:07:26.388 --> 00:07:29.516
- Merry Christmas.
- Hello, Merry Christmas.

00:07:29.516 --> 00:07:30.642
Hello.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.370
- How are you, Auntie?
- Merry Christmas!

00:07:40.598 --> 00:07:41.598
Pa!

00:07:41.604 --> 00:07:42.707
- Sweetheart.
- Need help?

00:07:43.204 --> 00:07:45.084
Can you keep stirring this?

00:07:45.415 --> 00:07:46.415
Okay.

00:07:46.618 --> 00:07:48.152
I’ll bring the fruits out first.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:49.811
Thank you.

00:07:49.811 --> 00:07:50.812
Sure.

00:07:51.742 --> 00:07:53.557
You can’t really
leave this unattended.

00:07:58.671 --> 00:07:59.839
Where are you going?

00:08:01.424 --> 00:08:03.092
It smells so good here.

00:08:07.138 --> 00:08:09.348
How are you
and Arkin doing, Via?

00:08:09.348 --> 00:08:11.032
He’s not making things
hard for you, is he?

00:08:12.518 --> 00:08:13.728
Oh no, Auntie, not at all.

00:08:13.728 --> 00:08:15.103
We’re doing really well.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.543
That’s good.

00:08:17.523 --> 00:08:19.233
I just wanted to say thank you

00:08:19.233 --> 00:08:21.096
for always being there for him.

00:08:22.361 --> 00:08:24.030
I know he’s happy
with what he’s doing,

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.048
but your situation isn’t easy.

00:08:27.992 --> 00:08:31.094
So thank you for
accepting him as he is.

00:08:31.624 --> 00:08:32.625
Yeah.

00:08:33.143 --> 00:08:34.728
And if you remember,

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.684
even when they were kids,
they were inseparable.

00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:42.319
If you took Via away,
Arkin would cry.

00:08:42.319 --> 00:08:43.695
If Arkin wasn’t around,

00:08:44.128 --> 00:08:45.495
Via wouldn’t talk to anyone.

00:08:46.168 --> 00:08:49.547
I always knew they would
eventually fall for each other.

00:08:50.137 --> 00:08:51.865
That’s right. Inseparable.

00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:57.295
Via, if you ever have
misunderstandings or problems,

00:08:57.295 --> 00:09:00.090
just know that it’s part
of the relationship.

00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:03.501
In fact, sometimes it even helps to

00:09:03.802 --> 00:09:05.929
make your relationship stronger.

00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:07.055
- That’s true.
- Yeah.

00:09:07.055 --> 00:09:08.494
Just don’t give up on each other.

00:09:09.228 --> 00:09:11.731
And to be honest,
your Auntie and I

00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:12.775
have been through so much.

00:09:12.782 --> 00:09:14.269
- That’s true.
- But look at us.

00:09:14.276 --> 00:09:16.028
Yeah, look at us.

00:09:16.028 --> 00:09:17.140
We’re still here.

00:09:19.068 --> 00:09:20.862
You know,
ever since you were a kid,

00:09:20.862 --> 00:09:22.136
you’ve been part of the family.

00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:24.272
And you will always be
part of the family.

00:09:26.854 --> 00:09:27.984
Thank you, Auntie.

00:09:28.652 --> 00:09:29.719
Uncle, thank you.

00:09:31.602 --> 00:09:32.895
Okay, let’s eat now.

00:09:32.895 --> 00:09:34.104
Get the carbonara.

00:09:34.104 --> 00:09:35.104
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:09:35.117 --> 00:09:36.327
Here are the plates.

00:09:39.878 --> 00:09:40.878
That’s right.

00:09:40.884 --> 00:09:43.595
I also see Kino’s family
as my own.

00:09:43.595 --> 00:09:47.265
To me, he isn’t Larkin Sanchez
the celebrity.

00:09:53.495 --> 00:09:55.636
He’s just Kino,
my childhood friend.

00:09:59.236 --> 00:10:02.114
One of the first people
who accepted me.

00:10:02.114 --> 00:10:04.533
And now, the person I love.

00:10:17.838 --> 00:10:20.173
Even if everything is
hard and complicated,

00:10:20.511 --> 00:10:21.913
I will stay.

00:10:22.381 --> 00:10:23.832
I love Kino,

00:10:24.141 --> 00:10:26.042
and I want to
always be with him.

00:10:38.697 --> 00:10:41.200
I’m slowly learning
not to be afraid

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.257
of his spotlight anymore.

00:11:12.851 --> 00:11:18.379
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six—
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six—

00:11:18.392 --> 00:11:23.105
- five, four, three, two, one!
- five, four, three, two, one!

00:11:23.107 --> 00:11:26.402
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:35.403
Happy New Year!

00:11:37.311 --> 00:11:38.862
Happy New Year!

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.748
Happy New Year!

00:11:46.935 --> 00:11:48.583
In moments like this,

00:11:49.148 --> 00:11:51.127
it’s easy to forget everything.

00:11:51.567 --> 00:11:55.398
All I know right now
is that we’re happy.

00:11:55.946 --> 00:11:57.382
Kino and I are really happy.

00:11:57.625 --> 00:11:58.625
Cheers!

00:12:00.438 --> 00:12:01.822
This is so much fun!

00:12:04.116 --> 00:12:06.184
- My goodness.
- Here, eat now. Go ahead.

00:12:21.936 --> 00:12:24.619
So, how are the kids?
How is Via?

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.107
She still hasn’t
visited her mom?

00:12:31.398 --> 00:12:33.233
She really won’t go.

00:12:34.109 --> 00:12:36.319
She might end up being
haunted by her mom at this point.

00:12:38.113 --> 00:12:40.574
Well, I don’t know
what to do anymore.

00:12:40.574 --> 00:12:41.950
Via really doesn’t want to go.

00:12:43.201 --> 00:12:44.869
Of all the things she
could have inherited

00:12:44.869 --> 00:12:47.706
from your wife, it had
to be stubbornness.

00:12:48.248 --> 00:12:49.291
When she wants something,
she wants it.

00:12:49.291 --> 00:12:50.584
When she doesn’t, she doesn’t.

00:12:50.959 --> 00:12:53.314
And they’re both
really good at music too.

00:12:55.255 --> 00:12:58.903
Sometimes when I look at Via,

00:12:59.926 --> 00:13:01.197
I think of Ivy.

00:13:04.368 --> 00:13:06.142
But she actually doesn’t
like music anymore.

00:13:06.149 --> 00:13:07.537
Probably because of her mom.

00:13:08.573 --> 00:13:09.807
She’s still angry.

00:13:12.118 --> 00:13:13.245
Which is understandable.

00:13:13.245 --> 00:13:14.829
I can’t really blame her.

00:13:15.664 --> 00:13:18.089
I mean, she has
struggled because—

00:13:19.793 --> 00:13:23.338
she had to sacrifice
her time for her siblings.

00:13:30.341 --> 00:13:31.342
And

00:13:32.138 --> 00:13:33.473
she had to step up so early

00:13:34.516 --> 00:13:38.144
and become a
second mother to them.

00:13:40.272 --> 00:13:43.823
That’s why she never really
got to fully enjoy her childhood.

00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:53.709
You know,

00:13:55.537 --> 00:13:57.775
I want to apologize to Via.

00:14:07.465 --> 00:14:12.262
And thank her every day for
everything she’s done for us.

00:14:16.725 --> 00:14:17.982
I feel like

00:14:19.436 --> 00:14:21.694
I’ve always depended on her.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.971
I feel like

00:14:31.232 --> 00:14:32.517
she’s been having a hard time

00:14:32.531 --> 00:14:35.976
carrying all the responsibilities
her mom left behind.

00:14:53.093 --> 00:14:54.345
Via is strong.

00:14:56.263 --> 00:14:57.897
Maybe you need
to talk to her more.

00:14:59.048 --> 00:15:00.399
Talk to your daughter.

00:15:02.102 --> 00:15:03.312
She might be going
through something

00:15:03.312 --> 00:15:04.605
you don’t even know about.

00:15:07.601 --> 00:15:11.583
Just be there for your children
as much as you can.

00:15:16.075 --> 00:15:17.075
Cheers.

00:15:17.246 --> 00:15:18.246
Cheers.

00:15:18.255 --> 00:15:19.506
Come on…

00:15:20.755 --> 00:15:21.756
More, please.

00:15:22.128 --> 00:15:23.129
Please.

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:26.676
Is that how Papa feels about me?

00:15:27.262 --> 00:15:30.054
I’m actually okay with
everything I’ve sacrificed.

00:15:30.503 --> 00:15:32.599
It’s tiring and difficult,

00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:35.685
but it’s all right because
I’m doing it for our family.

00:15:36.359 --> 00:15:39.313
It hurts hearing Papa say that.

00:15:39.946 --> 00:15:42.150
He’s been working
so hard for us.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:46.313
To make up for what was
left behind by Mama.

00:15:47.996 --> 00:15:51.534
To give us things
we never even asked for.

00:15:52.334 --> 00:15:55.999
Mama, you’re the
reason for all of this.

00:16:23.907 --> 00:16:24.960
Long time no see.

00:16:28.583 --> 00:16:31.294
After not visiting you for so long,

00:16:31.878 --> 00:16:34.201
you already became
a stranger to me

00:16:34.757 --> 00:16:37.247
I don’t even know
why I’m here right now.

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:43.309
Whenever I think about how Mira,
Ysha, and especially Aidan suffered

00:16:43.314 --> 00:16:45.088
because they didn’t have a mother,

00:16:45.647 --> 00:16:47.465
I get angry all over again.

00:16:48.405 --> 00:16:54.013
My siblings’ childhood was filled
with fighting, shouting, and fear.

00:16:54.531 --> 00:16:58.351
Those memories will stay with them
as they grow up.

00:17:00.222 --> 00:17:04.295
But Papa and I will do everything
we can to heal those wounds

00:17:04.923 --> 00:17:07.588
and replace them with
love and happiness.

00:17:14.413 --> 00:17:15.445
Merry Christmas.

00:17:18.082 --> 00:17:19.247
Happy New Year.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:49.890
Enjoy, my dear.

00:17:49.896 --> 00:17:51.737
I’ll pick you up later.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:53.476
I love you.

00:17:53.476 --> 00:17:56.159
Bye, Ma! I love you.

00:18:03.778 --> 00:18:06.753
Via! You’re here.

00:18:06.758 --> 00:18:07.758
Here.

00:18:09.476 --> 00:18:10.978
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

00:18:11.645 --> 00:18:13.981
Thanks. This is a lot.

00:18:13.981 --> 00:18:15.524
You know how these fans are.

00:18:15.524 --> 00:18:18.013
They really go all out
when they love someone.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.564
This probably has got
your shoulders up high, huh?

00:18:21.956 --> 00:18:22.956
What do you mean?

00:18:22.981 --> 00:18:25.646
Because out
of all the girls here,

00:18:25.936 --> 00:18:28.524
you’re the only one
he goes home to.

00:18:28.802 --> 00:18:30.679
- Hey! You’re blushing!
- What are you saying?

00:18:30.704 --> 00:18:32.612
Be careful, someone
might hear you.

00:18:35.569 --> 00:18:36.570
Excuse me.

00:18:37.482 --> 00:18:39.150
You must be daydreaming?

00:18:39.269 --> 00:18:40.269
With all due respect,

00:18:40.278 --> 00:18:41.947
I’m the only one
Larkin goes home to.

00:18:41.947 --> 00:18:43.365
Sure, miss.

00:18:43.365 --> 00:18:45.666
She’s really delusional, huh?

00:18:48.286 --> 00:18:49.286
So annoying.

00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:51.293
- Should I just confront her?
- Don’t!

00:18:51.293 --> 00:18:52.590
Don’t.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.506
Oh my gosh, do you
think Clea will come?

00:18:55.506 --> 00:18:58.884
Duh! Isn’t she supposed
to support her boyfriend?

00:18:59.632 --> 00:19:02.051
No wonder she’s busy.

00:19:02.385 --> 00:19:05.304
For sure, she’ll also
congratulate Arkin.

00:19:05.304 --> 00:19:07.397
Did you watch
their last interview?

00:19:07.924 --> 00:19:09.551
They even had a lovers’ quarrel.

00:19:09.551 --> 00:19:10.552
Because they were asked

00:19:10.552 --> 00:19:12.001
if they have someone
they’re jealous of.

00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:13.026
Girl!

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.844
Wow, that—

00:19:17.512 --> 00:19:20.197
Should I confront her?
I really want to.

00:19:20.211 --> 00:19:21.463
No, don’t.

00:19:21.463 --> 00:19:22.922
Larkin’s new song—

00:19:22.922 --> 00:19:24.843
- is for Clea!
- For Clea!

00:19:25.842 --> 00:19:26.843
Right?

00:19:26.843 --> 00:19:28.751
Don’t listen to them
anymore. Come on.

00:19:29.198 --> 00:19:30.658
Arkin looks
so cute there, right?

00:19:38.207 --> 00:19:39.720
Are you all ready?

00:19:41.502 --> 00:19:43.516
Let’s not keep this any longer.

00:19:43.522 --> 00:19:48.235
Let’s all welcome,
Larkin Sanchez!

00:19:57.294 --> 00:19:58.628
Larkin!

00:19:58.996 --> 00:19:59.997
Hi, guys!

00:19:59.997 --> 00:20:02.750
Thank you for coming
to my album launch party.

00:20:03.208 --> 00:20:05.836
I’m really excited to share
my new songs with you.

00:20:06.712 --> 00:20:12.343
So let’s start with me singing
the title track of my album—

00:20:12.343 --> 00:20:13.594
My Favorite Movie.

00:20:26.713 --> 00:20:30.300
It's Saturday, I'm all alone.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.178
I'm stuck inside
my trailer home.

00:20:33.178 --> 00:20:37.643
And all I could think of
is how you doin'.

00:20:38.516 --> 00:20:41.443
Getting places I don't know,

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:44.244
interviews and TV shows.

00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:49.041
But I just wanna pack my
things and just get goin'.

00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:52.251
'Cause all I want is you.

00:20:54.296 --> 00:20:58.133
Behind the cameras,
I see you.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.863
You know it's only you and me.

00:21:04.863 --> 00:21:07.699
And no one else will ever be,

00:21:07.699 --> 00:21:10.619
The leading lady in this story.

00:21:10.619 --> 00:21:12.871
That will always be…

00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:17.667
My favorite movie.

00:21:17.876 --> 00:21:20.185
It feels like this
song is for you.

00:21:22.037 --> 00:21:23.246
I get it now.

00:21:23.663 --> 00:21:25.749
It’s funny because they
thought it was for Clea

00:21:25.749 --> 00:21:27.250
since he said, “leading lady.”

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:28.250
As if.

00:21:28.835 --> 00:21:32.250
I'm wishing you're here
by my side tonight.

00:21:32.589 --> 00:21:35.920
Missing you in every mornin'.

00:21:36.843 --> 00:21:39.721
I can't wait to
leave this place,

00:21:39.721 --> 00:21:42.724
'Cause nothing beats
your sweet embrace.

00:21:42.724 --> 00:21:47.729
'Cause there's no better song
than hearing your heart beating.

00:21:47.729 --> 00:21:50.648
'Cause all I want is you.

00:21:52.034 --> 00:21:55.940
Oh! Girl, you two are really
staring at each other.

00:21:58.165 --> 00:21:59.166
We’re not.

00:21:59.166 --> 00:22:00.167
Really now?

00:22:00.417 --> 00:22:03.170
You know it's only you and me.

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:06.173
And no one else will ever be,

00:22:06.173 --> 00:22:09.093
The leading lady
in this story.

00:22:09.093 --> 00:22:11.178
That will always be…

00:22:11.178 --> 00:22:16.016
My favorite movie.

00:22:16.934 --> 00:22:21.939
My favorite movie.

00:22:32.366 --> 00:22:33.742
It’s time for the acting challenge!

00:22:33.742 --> 00:22:34.869
I’m so excited!

00:22:34.869 --> 00:22:36.579
What do you want to hear, huh?

00:22:37.728 --> 00:22:38.937
That you love me.

00:22:39.354 --> 00:22:40.731
You do love me, right?

00:22:41.068 --> 00:22:43.484
And if yes, what would you do?

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.240
I love you.

00:22:47.961 --> 00:22:48.962
Okay.

00:22:50.336 --> 00:22:51.669
Not good, she’s not good.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:52.816
Are you okay?

00:22:53.525 --> 00:22:55.527
She’s fine. Thank you.

00:22:57.467 --> 00:22:58.468
Ah, the mic.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.720
Hi.

00:23:02.388 --> 00:23:03.389
Are you ready?

00:23:05.266 --> 00:23:06.768
Let’s go, let’s go!

00:23:06.768 --> 00:23:07.936
Are you nervous?

00:23:09.104 --> 00:23:10.522
Not really? Okay then.

00:23:12.232 --> 00:23:13.733
What do you want to hear?

00:23:14.859 --> 00:23:16.528
That you love me.
You do love me, right?

00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:18.689
If I say yes, what will you do?

00:23:20.865 --> 00:23:21.901
I love you.

00:23:26.871 --> 00:23:27.871
Great, that was great.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.324
Let’s give her
a round of applause!

00:23:29.924 --> 00:23:31.634
That’s my friend right there!

00:23:32.939 --> 00:23:34.037
Okay, let’s do this.

00:23:35.744 --> 00:23:38.042
So, what do you
really want to hear, huh?

00:23:38.986 --> 00:23:42.198
That you love me.
You do love me, right?

00:23:43.047 --> 00:23:45.577
And if I say yes,
what would you do?

00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:47.161
I love you.

00:23:49.747 --> 00:23:50.748
Okay.

00:23:50.748 --> 00:23:53.056
We’re done. Thank you!

00:23:55.711 --> 00:24:00.258
And the winner of our
Acting Challenge is—

00:24:01.367 --> 00:24:02.367
Rye!

00:24:02.785 --> 00:24:04.329
A round of applause for Rye.

00:24:04.871 --> 00:24:06.748
Congratulations,
thank you for participating.

00:24:06.748 --> 00:24:07.748
- You may take your seats now.
- She’s my friend!

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:08.876
- That’s my friend right there!
- Thank you.

00:24:09.166 --> 00:24:11.418
Rye, thank you so much.
Congratulations!

00:24:12.043 --> 00:24:18.008
Rye, you won a new album
and exclusive posters.

00:24:18.008 --> 00:24:19.968
Since when have
you been a fan of Arkin?

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:21.820
Since birth.

00:24:21.845 --> 00:24:23.263
Since birth? So delulu!

00:24:23.263 --> 00:24:24.347
Since birth?

00:24:24.347 --> 00:24:27.058
From the very beginning.
When he started this.

00:24:27.893 --> 00:24:29.269
Are you childhood friends?

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:31.438
No, that was a mistake.

00:24:32.272 --> 00:24:34.357
What’s your message for Larkin?

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.797
Congratulations on
your album launch, Larkin.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:48.117
Thank you for being an
inspiration to so many.

00:24:48.117 --> 00:24:50.259
The people here
love you so much.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.707
And I’m sure many
more will love

00:24:54.707 --> 00:24:56.662
and accept you completely.

00:24:58.914 --> 00:24:59.915
Thanks.

00:25:01.755 --> 00:25:03.299
And as your fan,

00:25:06.385 --> 00:25:07.386
I’m—

00:25:10.597 --> 00:25:12.428
I’m always proud of you.

00:25:12.766 --> 00:25:14.560
Of everything you do,

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.179
of all your achievements,

00:25:17.239 --> 00:25:18.240
and

00:25:18.991 --> 00:25:21.399
even if others leave you,

00:25:22.499 --> 00:25:25.315
even if everyone
leaves you, I’ll stay.

00:25:28.709 --> 00:25:32.880
I’m here because
that’s how much—

00:25:41.272 --> 00:25:42.932
That’s how much I love you.

00:25:55.861 --> 00:25:57.237
Wow.

00:25:57.237 --> 00:25:59.740
A very heartwarming message.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.074
Congratulations again, Rye,

00:26:01.074 --> 00:26:02.576
and you can
take your seat now.

00:26:02.576 --> 00:26:04.161
Thank you so much
for participating.

00:26:05.412 --> 00:26:08.233
Wait, Larkin is texting.

00:26:08.699 --> 00:26:10.618
Is that Clea, brother?

00:26:10.868 --> 00:26:13.037
I always love you, love.

00:26:13.037 --> 00:26:14.163
So guys, don’t go yet

00:26:14.163 --> 00:26:17.208
because we’re about
to have a photo-op.

00:26:17.493 --> 00:26:20.830
Ushers, please
assist the first group.

00:26:22.039 --> 00:26:23.916
It’s because
you’re going to have

00:26:23.916 --> 00:26:26.668
- your photo-op now!
- I was totally swooning earlier!

00:26:26.668 --> 00:26:28.378
Don’t ever break up, okay?

00:26:28.378 --> 00:26:29.463
Because if you do,

00:26:29.463 --> 00:26:31.882
I really won’t believe
in love anymore.

00:26:32.275 --> 00:26:33.275
Yeah.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.473
- You’re feeling giddy, huh?
- No, I'm not!

00:26:35.498 --> 00:26:37.846
You are, I can tell!

00:26:38.924 --> 00:26:39.925
Luna!

00:26:41.444 --> 00:26:42.444
Luna!

00:26:42.469 --> 00:26:44.012
Okay, next, next group!

00:26:45.847 --> 00:26:47.523
You said, I love you.

00:27:02.816 --> 00:27:03.900
- Sweetheart.
- Pa?

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.291
Your aunt called earlier.

00:27:06.236 --> 00:27:07.237
What about, Pa?

00:27:07.821 --> 00:27:10.740
She said she’ll take care
of your papers for Spain.

00:27:12.159 --> 00:27:13.799
Her suggestion is that

00:27:16.079 --> 00:27:17.456
you do an apprenticeship first

00:27:17.456 --> 00:27:19.638
and take the board exams
here before you go there.

00:27:22.961 --> 00:27:23.962
Oh…

00:27:24.955 --> 00:27:26.392
Will I be there
for a long time, Pa?

00:27:26.715 --> 00:27:28.981
You’ll work for her
for a few years.

00:27:30.196 --> 00:27:32.011
The pay there is good.

00:27:32.271 --> 00:27:34.360
And if you want to continue
your studies there,

00:27:34.385 --> 00:27:35.761
she said she’ll take care of it.

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:43.811
Okay.

00:27:58.188 --> 00:28:00.709
Sweetheart, are you sure
you’re okay with that?

00:28:02.371 --> 00:28:04.225
Because you’ll be far from us,

00:28:04.498 --> 00:28:06.394
from your friends,
and from Arkin, too.

00:28:07.501 --> 00:28:09.003
If you want,

00:28:09.003 --> 00:28:11.771
I can just ask your aunt

00:28:11.796 --> 00:28:13.775
to let me pay her back
in installments.

00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:14.790
Pa.

00:28:16.584 --> 00:28:17.654
I’m okay.

00:28:18.332 --> 00:28:19.375
Don’t think like that, Pa.

00:28:19.375 --> 00:28:21.305
I don’t want you worrying
about things like that.

00:28:22.086 --> 00:28:23.837
This is for our family anyway.

00:28:23.837 --> 00:28:24.838
This is for us.

00:28:24.838 --> 00:28:26.243
For Mira, Ysha,
and Aidan’s future.

00:28:28.092 --> 00:28:29.426
Pa, I’ll do it.

00:28:30.227 --> 00:28:32.377
Please don’t worry,
I’m really okay.

00:28:33.021 --> 00:28:35.023
And I also want to repay Auntie

00:28:35.023 --> 00:28:36.817
for all the help she’s given me.

00:28:37.067 --> 00:28:38.402
She’s helped a lot
these past few years.

00:28:39.511 --> 00:28:41.630
All right, but if you
change your mind,

00:28:41.655 --> 00:28:44.533
just tell me, okay?
Papa will find a way.

00:28:46.609 --> 00:28:47.610
Thank you.

00:28:47.901 --> 00:28:49.189
- Okay.
- Dude!

00:28:50.404 --> 00:28:53.774
Wait, I think my friend’s here.

00:29:00.623 --> 00:29:03.543
How am I supposed
to tell Arkin about this?

00:29:04.126 --> 00:29:06.661
Maybe Auntie will
still change her mind.

00:29:07.171 --> 00:29:08.830
I won’t say anything for now.

00:29:09.256 --> 00:29:12.167
I’ll just focus
on graduating first.

00:29:40.476 --> 00:29:41.760
Love, are you still busy?

00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:44.115
Almost done. Why?

00:29:45.641 --> 00:29:47.077
Sorry, am I taking too long?

00:29:47.102 --> 00:29:48.161
No, it’s okay.

00:29:48.661 --> 00:29:50.288
I just wanted to
say something.

00:29:51.372 --> 00:29:52.373
What is it?

00:29:54.792 --> 00:29:58.546
For our anniversary,
we have an out-of-town—

00:29:59.797 --> 00:30:01.132
We’re going out of town?

00:30:02.883 --> 00:30:03.884
No, love.

00:30:04.302 --> 00:30:07.097
I have an out-of-town shoot.

00:30:09.305 --> 00:30:10.305
Huh?

00:30:10.933 --> 00:30:12.612
Two days straight.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.524
But that’s our anniversary.

00:30:19.775 --> 00:30:21.485
I mean, I don’t want
to be petty,

00:30:21.485 --> 00:30:23.821
but of course I want you
with me on that day.

00:30:23.821 --> 00:30:24.989
We’re supposed to celebrate it

00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:27.366
because it’s our anniversary.

00:30:27.366 --> 00:30:28.367
Am I wrong?

00:30:29.702 --> 00:30:30.953
Love, I know.

00:30:32.079 --> 00:30:33.456
I tried to have the shoot moved,

00:30:33.456 --> 00:30:36.208
but nothing can be done.

00:30:36.751 --> 00:30:37.878
I’m sorry, love.

00:30:39.243 --> 00:30:41.203
Do whatever you want.

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:42.840
Love.

00:30:43.674 --> 00:30:44.884
I’m sorry.

00:30:45.968 --> 00:30:48.054
I’ll try my best to
finish the shoot early

00:30:48.054 --> 00:30:49.347
and come home right away.

00:30:50.282 --> 00:30:51.282
One take.

00:30:51.307 --> 00:30:53.601
I’ll do every scene
in one take. I promise.

00:30:57.471 --> 00:30:58.471
Kino, I get it.

00:30:58.478 --> 00:31:00.984
I understand
because it’s your job.

00:31:01.778 --> 00:31:04.031
But even just that day.

00:31:04.711 --> 00:31:06.296
Is it really not possible

00:31:07.077 --> 00:31:08.954
to at least block it off?

00:31:09.621 --> 00:31:10.622
Love.

00:31:12.624 --> 00:31:14.897
I really don’t control
my schedule.

00:31:15.794 --> 00:31:17.959
When I found out
I had a shoot that day,

00:31:19.047 --> 00:31:20.336
I really fought for it.

00:31:21.603 --> 00:31:23.351
But they said it
really wasn’t possible.

00:31:27.451 --> 00:31:29.574
What else can I do?

00:31:32.361 --> 00:31:33.612
I’m sorry, love.

00:31:33.612 --> 00:31:37.908
What can I do so you won’t
be mad at me anymore?

00:31:42.704 --> 00:31:43.956
What you said.

00:31:44.748 --> 00:31:46.542
Try to finish your shoot early

00:31:46.542 --> 00:31:48.252
so you can come back right away.

00:31:49.897 --> 00:31:52.244
So we can still celebrate.

00:31:53.921 --> 00:31:55.130
That’s a promise, okay?

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:56.945
I swear on it.

00:31:57.746 --> 00:31:58.746
Promise?

00:31:58.771 --> 00:32:00.544
I promise. I’m sorry, love.

00:32:00.547 --> 00:32:02.424
Don’t sulk anymore. I’m sorry.

00:32:18.524 --> 00:32:20.855
What? Why are you staring?

00:32:21.318 --> 00:32:23.108
Are you still together
with your boyfriend?

00:32:23.598 --> 00:32:24.599
Huh?

00:32:25.925 --> 00:32:27.654
Yeah. Why?

00:32:28.734 --> 00:32:29.984
It’s been a long time now, huh?

00:32:35.351 --> 00:32:38.498
You know, my brother
working in the media said

00:32:39.271 --> 00:32:42.210
that ArClea aren’t really
spending much time together.

00:32:42.691 --> 00:32:44.318
Aren’t you a Larkin fan?

00:32:44.944 --> 00:32:48.091
Is it true? Because I still
don’t really believe it.

00:32:49.782 --> 00:32:51.742
Come on, I’m working here,

00:32:51.742 --> 00:32:53.702
and you keep talking so much.

00:32:54.119 --> 00:32:56.997
Besides, it’s their life.
What can we do?

00:32:56.997 --> 00:32:59.227
Let them do
whatever they want.

00:33:01.912 --> 00:33:02.912
Wait.

00:33:02.937 --> 00:33:05.316
You have a sibling
working in the media?

00:33:05.559 --> 00:33:08.319
Yes. A photographer
for a magazine.

00:33:08.603 --> 00:33:11.489
I actually get a lot of
inside scoop from him.

00:33:13.316 --> 00:33:14.317
Like what?

00:33:15.318 --> 00:33:19.573
Samantha Vera was
supposedly engaged before.

00:33:21.241 --> 00:33:24.578
This is Clyden, my boyfriend.

00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:26.037
Huh?

00:33:28.582 --> 00:33:32.802
Geez, where did you hear that?

00:33:33.295 --> 00:33:34.337
Sounds like fake news,

00:33:34.337 --> 00:33:35.756
not believable.

00:33:35.756 --> 00:33:38.091
My brother said it’s from
someone in the media.

00:33:38.091 --> 00:33:41.136
The insider info is
supposed to be legit.

00:33:41.511 --> 00:33:43.555
They even attended
the engagement party.

00:33:43.555 --> 00:33:46.767
But they broke up, so
it’s pointless news now.

00:33:48.894 --> 00:33:51.563
Still doesn’t sound
very believable.

00:33:52.022 --> 00:33:53.023
Want more?

00:33:53.082 --> 00:33:54.082
There’s more?

00:33:54.107 --> 00:33:56.610
Clea supposedly
liked someone else,

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:58.411
but that person
didn’t like her back.

00:33:58.737 --> 00:34:01.072
So Larkin is just a rebound.

00:34:02.233 --> 00:34:04.527
You rejected me
again through text.

00:34:05.373 --> 00:34:07.625
I’m sorry, but
I don’t like you, Zo.

00:34:08.447 --> 00:34:09.782
Now that—

00:34:10.873 --> 00:34:12.375
That really sounds
like fake news.

00:34:12.375 --> 00:34:14.001
Don’t believe stuff like that.

00:34:14.001 --> 00:34:15.920
False information is bad.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.514
Gossip? Don’t believe it.

00:34:18.047 --> 00:34:19.590
You never know.

00:34:19.966 --> 00:34:21.676
Where do you think
gossip comes from

00:34:21.676 --> 00:34:23.970
if there’s no hint
of truth to it, right?

00:34:29.976 --> 00:34:31.602
Oh, sorry, I just
need to answer this.

00:34:31.602 --> 00:34:34.355
Sure. Talk for as
long as you want.

00:34:39.895 --> 00:34:42.289
How did they
even find all that out?

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.209
What is this?

00:34:56.752 --> 00:34:58.462
Clea and Arkin on a date?

00:34:58.462 --> 00:34:59.922
Weren’t they just at a shoot?

00:34:59.922 --> 00:35:01.382
Girl, calm down.

00:35:01.382 --> 00:35:03.593
You’re more affected
than the actual girlfriend.

00:35:03.593 --> 00:35:06.012
Isn’t it annoying?
It’s your anniversary.

00:35:06.387 --> 00:35:08.723
If that were me,
I’d be really pissed.

00:35:08.723 --> 00:35:10.275
I don’t know how
she puts up with it.

00:35:10.892 --> 00:35:12.059
How do you do it?

00:35:12.351 --> 00:35:13.352
It’s okay.

00:35:13.936 --> 00:35:15.229
He asked permission
from me anyway.

00:35:18.733 --> 00:35:20.151
Has he texted again?

00:35:21.819 --> 00:35:22.987
Not yet.

00:35:24.405 --> 00:35:26.708
How am I supposed
to give him my gift?

00:35:27.533 --> 00:35:28.534
What is it anyway?

00:35:29.243 --> 00:35:30.995
- Let me see, let me see.
- What’s your gift?

00:35:34.457 --> 00:35:37.251
- It’s so pretty.
- Wow.

00:35:38.209 --> 00:35:39.794
I hope he likes it.

00:35:40.169 --> 00:35:41.181
It’s beautiful.

00:35:42.122 --> 00:35:44.553
I also hope he makes it
to our anniversary.

00:35:45.083 --> 00:35:46.627
He still hasn’t texted.

00:35:46.919 --> 00:35:48.253
He’ll make it.

00:35:50.213 --> 00:35:51.214
Should we drink?

00:35:51.214 --> 00:35:52.758
- Okay, let’s drink. I’m getting annoyed.
- Let’s drink.

00:35:52.758 --> 00:35:54.343
- Excuse me, just following up.
- I’m annoyed.

00:35:54.343 --> 00:35:56.303
Just following up on
our drink order.

00:35:56.303 --> 00:35:57.971
- Here it is.
- It’s coming.

00:35:57.971 --> 00:36:00.271
Hey, are you sure about this?
You might get drunk later.

00:36:00.271 --> 00:36:02.712
It’s fine. I can handle myself.

00:36:04.074 --> 00:36:05.075
Thank you.

00:36:05.075 --> 00:36:06.664
- Thanks.
- Come on.

00:36:06.928 --> 00:36:08.917
- Let’s just drink. I’m annoyed.
- Cheers.

00:36:10.067 --> 00:36:11.174
He’ll make it.

00:36:12.367 --> 00:36:13.630
Should I leave a comment?

00:36:14.119 --> 00:36:16.872
No, stop. Via’s not
even doing anything.

00:36:16.872 --> 00:36:18.582
Via, be careful not
to get drunk, okay?

00:36:27.466 --> 00:36:29.676
Cheers!

00:36:30.427 --> 00:36:32.971
Via, wait. You’re getting drunk.

00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:33.971
Hey!

00:36:33.996 --> 00:36:35.735
What? I told you
I can handle this.

00:36:37.059 --> 00:36:38.060
She says she can.

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.022
Luna, you’re really so cute.

00:36:42.022 --> 00:36:43.440
I love you so much.

00:36:46.401 --> 00:36:48.820
Via, you’re really drunk now!

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:49.905
I’m not drunk.

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.545
I miss my boyfriend.

00:36:53.992 --> 00:36:55.285
And here it comes.

00:36:55.928 --> 00:36:59.806
I miss my boyfriend so much.
I really miss him.

00:36:59.831 --> 00:37:01.678
I wonder if he misses me, too.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.495
Does he still love me?

00:37:03.877 --> 00:37:04.878
It feels like he doesn’t.

00:37:04.878 --> 00:37:06.600
He doesn’t love me anymore.

00:37:07.129 --> 00:37:08.685
He doesn’t love me anymore.

00:37:10.509 --> 00:37:12.230
Via, you’re drunk. Stop—

00:37:13.887 --> 00:37:15.097
I’m not drunk!

00:37:17.724 --> 00:37:18.725
I’m not drunk.

00:37:19.142 --> 00:37:20.811
Come on now…

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.730
But no, he doesn’t
love me anymore.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:24.731
Look.

00:37:25.565 --> 00:37:26.566
Via?

00:37:27.067 --> 00:37:30.195
No texts, no calls.
Doesn’t he remember me?

00:37:30.195 --> 00:37:31.613
What’s the point of this phone?

00:37:31.613 --> 00:37:32.781
I should just throw it away.

00:37:33.156 --> 00:37:35.033
Don’t cry anymore.
He’s on his way.

00:37:35.033 --> 00:37:36.034
I promise.

00:37:36.034 --> 00:37:38.412
He’s on his way.
Here, give it to me.

00:37:38.412 --> 00:37:39.830
There, see?
He said he’s coming.

00:37:40.872 --> 00:37:43.041
He probably doesn’t
love me anymore.

00:37:43.041 --> 00:37:45.752
It’s our anniversary today.
What time is it?

00:37:45.752 --> 00:37:47.587
But he’s still not here.
Where is he?

00:37:47.587 --> 00:37:50.048
He’s there. He’s there
with someone else.

00:37:50.048 --> 00:37:52.092
With another girl. I’m done.

00:37:52.092 --> 00:37:53.510
He loves you. He loves you.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:54.678
No. He doesn’t love me.

00:37:54.678 --> 00:37:55.721
- I’m done.
- Via.

00:37:55.721 --> 00:37:56.721
Via.

00:37:56.728 --> 00:37:57.728
Hey!

00:37:57.734 --> 00:37:58.735
Hey! What is that?

00:37:58.735 --> 00:38:00.445
I’ve got her, sir. It’s okay.

00:38:02.114 --> 00:38:03.114
Hey!

00:38:03.122 --> 00:38:04.122
I’m okay. I can handle myself.

00:38:04.135 --> 00:38:06.096
- Clea is just his coworker.
- Let’s drink more.

00:38:06.096 --> 00:38:07.243
Clea is just his coworker.

00:38:07.257 --> 00:38:08.654
- Let’s just drink some more.
- Come on, let’s drink.

00:38:08.664 --> 00:38:09.957
- I’ll go first.
- Drink—

00:38:10.653 --> 00:38:13.041
Don’t drink anymore.
You’re already drunk.

00:38:14.031 --> 00:38:15.491
Why are you embarrassed of me?

00:38:15.491 --> 00:38:16.909
Are you embarrassed of me?

00:38:16.909 --> 00:38:18.619
I thought we were friends.

00:38:18.619 --> 00:38:19.954
Why are you embarrassed of me?

00:38:19.954 --> 00:38:20.996
Don’t you love me anymore?

00:38:20.996 --> 00:38:22.581
- You’re just like Larkin.
- Love!

00:38:22.581 --> 00:38:24.792
- We love you—
- He doesn’t love me anymore.

00:38:25.376 --> 00:38:26.376
Hey!

00:38:26.379 --> 00:38:28.172
Stand up. It’s dirty.

00:38:28.172 --> 00:38:30.007
Arkin loves you, I swear.

00:38:30.007 --> 00:38:31.884
I promise, Arkin loves you,

00:38:33.845 --> 00:38:34.845
Via!

00:38:34.857 --> 00:38:37.109
And you’re the ones I’m
spending my anniversary with,

00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:38.109
why—

00:38:38.134 --> 00:38:39.135
Why?

00:38:41.968 --> 00:38:44.763
You’re not even the ones
I’m celebrating my anniversary with.

00:38:44.788 --> 00:38:46.498
- Via, that’s enough.
- No…

00:38:46.498 --> 00:38:48.374
I shouldn’t be celebrating
my anniversary with you.

00:38:48.374 --> 00:38:49.667
You’re not the ones
I’m giving my gift to.

00:38:49.667 --> 00:38:50.667
Isn’t my gift nice?

00:38:50.676 --> 00:38:52.094
- Yes, your gift is nice.
- It’s nice, really pretty.

00:38:52.094 --> 00:38:53.275
- My gift is pretty, right?
- Yes.

00:38:53.282 --> 00:38:54.649
- Very pretty. Nice, right?
- Very nice.

00:38:54.655 --> 00:38:56.198
But the person
I’m giving it to isn’t here.

00:38:56.991 --> 00:38:57.991
Don’t!

00:38:58.001 --> 00:38:59.544
I’ll just throw it away!

00:39:00.337 --> 00:39:02.339
We’re taking you
home now, please!

00:39:03.882 --> 00:39:05.592
He doesn’t love me anymore.

00:39:05.592 --> 00:39:07.552
Girl, they’ll make us leave now.

00:39:07.552 --> 00:39:08.552
Why?

00:39:08.565 --> 00:39:09.991
- Via?
- We’re sorry!

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:11.724
I’m fine, let’s drink some more.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:13.380
Sorry, I just arrived.

00:39:13.405 --> 00:39:14.531
Let’s drink, let’s drink. Ow!

00:39:14.531 --> 00:39:16.450
- Love? Come on, let’s go.
- Oh my gosh, Arkin.

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:18.607
Stand up. Let’s go home.

00:39:19.954 --> 00:39:21.276
You look like my boyfriend.

00:39:21.947 --> 00:39:23.653
But my boyfriend left me.

00:39:24.157 --> 00:39:26.201
He didn’t come even
if it’s our anniversary today.

00:39:26.201 --> 00:39:27.369
Sorry, I’m really sorry.

00:39:27.369 --> 00:39:28.369
I’ll take you guys home.

00:39:28.375 --> 00:39:29.751
- No need, just enjoy your anniversary.
- Where’s my boyfriend?

00:39:29.751 --> 00:39:31.753
- We’ll just walk with you to the parking lot.
- My boyfriend isn’t here.

00:39:31.753 --> 00:39:32.754
- Love.
- That was tiring.

00:39:32.754 --> 00:39:34.256
- He didn’t come.
- Stand up…

00:39:34.256 --> 00:39:36.258
It’s our anniversary, right?

00:39:37.425 --> 00:39:38.426
What’s hap—

00:39:39.279 --> 00:39:40.280
Where are her things?

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.587
- We got them.
- All right, let’s go.

00:39:42.491 --> 00:39:45.327
My boyfriend.
Arkin still isn’t here!

00:39:45.327 --> 00:39:46.328
Be careful!

00:40:07.299 --> 00:40:09.009
Happy anniversary, my love.

00:40:17.044 --> 00:40:18.045
Fuck you.

00:40:19.653 --> 00:40:23.379
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

00:40:23.575 --> 00:40:24.575
Fuck you.

00:40:27.619 --> 00:40:28.620
You really are drunk.

00:40:29.037 --> 00:40:30.164
I’m not drunk.

00:40:31.748 --> 00:40:34.306
But I won’t give you my gift.

00:40:35.836 --> 00:40:36.837
Why not?

00:40:38.488 --> 00:40:40.397
I came back as soon as I could.

00:40:40.707 --> 00:40:42.874
I kept my promise to you.
I did everything in one take.

00:40:45.654 --> 00:40:49.366
Our anniversary was
almost over when you arrived.

00:40:50.284 --> 00:40:52.661
Luna and Ke were
basically my boyfriends

00:40:52.661 --> 00:40:55.578
because they were the ones
with me on our anniversary.

00:40:55.798 --> 00:40:57.883
They were with me the whole day.

00:41:02.304 --> 00:41:04.379
Maybe you don’t
love me anymore.

00:41:05.217 --> 00:41:07.097
Do you love your
manager more now?

00:41:10.396 --> 00:41:11.897
You’re the only one I love.

00:41:12.481 --> 00:41:14.264
Please forgive me.

00:41:15.818 --> 00:41:19.280
I know I messed up.
I know you’re upset.

00:41:19.822 --> 00:41:21.365
I made you wait long.

00:41:23.904 --> 00:41:26.698
You always make me wait.

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.322
I’m sorry, love.

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:34.617
I really did everything I could
to get back here quickly.

00:41:38.788 --> 00:41:39.789
I love you.

00:42:05.106 --> 00:42:07.149
This is huge, Kino.

00:42:07.942 --> 00:42:09.652
It’s still not enough.

00:42:10.444 --> 00:42:11.445
I’m sorry.

00:42:12.655 --> 00:42:13.739
Are you still upset?

00:42:17.493 --> 00:42:21.372
We’ll always be together
no matter what, okay?

00:42:23.334 --> 00:42:24.542
I love you.

00:42:25.427 --> 00:42:26.428
I love you too.

00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:30.239
So, should we celebrate
our anniversary now?

00:42:32.267 --> 00:42:34.728
I have a surprise for you.
We’re going somewhere.

00:43:10.681 --> 00:43:11.922
Isn’t it beautiful here?

00:43:13.459 --> 00:43:14.534
It really is.

00:43:15.978 --> 00:43:17.463
- Right?
- Yes.

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:19.961
So, are you okay now?

00:43:20.587 --> 00:43:21.588
Are you still drunk?

00:43:21.588 --> 00:43:24.508
I’m not drunk.
I’m strong, you know.

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:36.781
Happy anniversary, love.

00:43:41.025 --> 00:43:42.193
What is this?

00:43:50.158 --> 00:43:54.788
So you can properly hear
the songs I write for you.

00:43:56.224 --> 00:43:58.268
Even if we’re not
always together,

00:43:59.627 --> 00:44:02.671
you can hear and feel my love.

00:44:10.243 --> 00:44:11.811
Happy anniversary, love.

00:44:27.304 --> 00:44:28.513
It’s beautiful.

00:44:33.477 --> 00:44:34.770
Did you paint this?

00:44:35.145 --> 00:44:36.146
Yes.

00:44:36.813 --> 00:44:40.650
That’s one of my favorite
moments of us together.

00:44:41.026 --> 00:44:44.863
And I want you to always see it.

00:44:53.205 --> 00:44:54.331
Thank you.

00:44:57.237 --> 00:44:59.113
Thank you for
always waiting for me.

00:45:00.114 --> 00:45:03.660
I’m sorry for all my
shortcomings with you.

00:45:04.452 --> 00:45:05.453
I promise

00:45:07.175 --> 00:45:08.385
I won’t do it again.

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:13.941
Look over there.

00:45:21.327 --> 00:45:22.616
Close your eyes.

00:45:24.834 --> 00:45:27.350
Imagine years from now,

00:45:28.629 --> 00:45:30.506
growing old together.

00:45:34.404 --> 00:45:35.655
Still happy.

00:45:36.964 --> 00:45:38.465
Loving each other even more.

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.885
Continuing to choose each other.

00:45:50.686 --> 00:45:52.729
We’ll end up saying that

00:45:53.313 --> 00:45:56.545
everything we went
through was worth it.

00:46:01.196 --> 00:46:03.636
There’s still a whole
lifetime ahead of us, Via.

00:46:05.798 --> 00:46:07.132
And I’ll make sure

00:46:08.662 --> 00:46:11.644
we spend every
anniversary together.

00:46:12.207 --> 00:46:15.502
From the second,
to the silver,

00:46:16.503 --> 00:46:18.651
even up to the
centennial anniversary.

00:46:20.787 --> 00:46:23.164
You’re the only one
I want to grow old with.

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:40.235
I’ve written so many
songs about you, for you.

00:46:42.321 --> 00:46:45.491
I just want you to know that—

00:46:47.492 --> 00:46:51.747
I love you more than every
lyric I could ever write.

00:46:53.248 --> 00:46:55.187
Thank you too,

00:46:57.586 --> 00:47:00.359
because even though
so many people love you,

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:04.613
you still choose
to love me the most.

00:47:08.138 --> 00:47:10.766
I love you so much, Kino.

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:00.610
Let’s go, love.

00:48:00.902 --> 00:48:02.505
- Huh?
- Come on.

00:48:02.529 --> 00:48:03.530
Why?

00:48:04.031 --> 00:48:05.198
We’re going somewhere else.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:07.409
I prepared dinner for us.

00:48:07.909 --> 00:48:10.245
- Okay.
- Come on.

00:48:10.633 --> 00:48:11.634
Let’s go.

00:48:15.137 --> 00:48:16.180
Careful now.

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.223
Yeah.

00:48:22.253 --> 00:48:25.747
Thanks again for tonight.
Happy anniversary.

00:48:26.828 --> 00:48:28.112
Love you.

00:48:40.037 --> 00:48:41.251
Good morning.

00:48:41.444 --> 00:48:42.570
Kino?

00:48:44.324 --> 00:48:45.450
Are you at a shoot?

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:47.077
He still hasn’t replied.

00:48:47.832 --> 00:48:48.959
I wonder if he’s busy.

00:48:57.009 --> 00:48:58.009
Via.

00:48:59.503 --> 00:49:00.921
Do you have something to say?

00:49:01.422 --> 00:49:03.048
I don’t want any showbiz
gossip for now, okay?

00:49:03.048 --> 00:49:04.049
But go ahead.

00:49:04.299 --> 00:49:06.468
I saw something from my brother.

00:49:06.611 --> 00:49:07.611
What?

00:49:07.636 --> 00:49:10.347
Pictures. Those pictures that—

00:49:10.597 --> 00:49:11.598
That what?

00:49:11.974 --> 00:49:14.827
What are you trying to say?
You’re stuttering.

00:49:15.436 --> 00:49:16.437
What?

00:49:16.437 --> 00:49:18.956
Nothing.
Don’t worry about it.

00:49:23.986 --> 00:49:25.171
What was that about?

00:49:45.186 --> 00:49:46.938
Why aren’t you
touching what I brought?

00:49:46.938 --> 00:49:47.938
Don’t you like it?

00:49:50.567 --> 00:49:51.568
Hold on—

00:49:52.481 --> 00:49:54.492
Are you really that
busy right now?

00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:58.263
We haven’t seen
each other in a long time.

00:49:59.864 --> 00:50:01.874
You were not replying
to my messages either.

00:50:06.876 --> 00:50:07.877
Kino?

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:10.967
What’s bothering you?

00:50:14.425 --> 00:50:15.430
Nothing, love.

00:50:16.594 --> 00:50:18.641
How’s school?

00:50:22.141 --> 00:50:23.141
It’s okay.

00:50:40.409 --> 00:50:41.539
I love you.

00:50:42.995 --> 00:50:44.709
Do you have any
problems at work?

00:50:49.835 --> 00:50:51.007
I love you too.

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:55.887
I love you so much.
Don’t forget that, okay?

00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:00.057
You’re being weird.

00:51:00.772 --> 00:51:02.377
What’s going on?

00:51:04.262 --> 00:51:05.263
Hey...

00:51:10.769 --> 00:51:11.986
Where’s your bracelet?

00:51:12.495 --> 00:51:16.448
Shit. I lost it, Via.
I’m sorry.

00:51:16.953 --> 00:51:17.954
Huh?

00:51:19.034 --> 00:51:20.035
Since when?

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.413
I don’t remember.

00:51:23.413 --> 00:51:26.500
I just noticed that it wasn't
on my wrist anymore.

00:51:27.543 --> 00:51:29.670
It’s okay, I’ll just
make a new one.

00:51:30.504 --> 00:51:31.920
It won’t take long
to do it anyway.

00:51:34.925 --> 00:51:36.969
Kino, are you lying to me?

00:51:40.597 --> 00:51:42.266
Hold on, I’ll just answer this.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:45.728
Yes sir?

00:51:46.036 --> 00:51:48.355
Yes, I just stopped by
somewhere. I’ll head—

00:51:48.367 --> 00:51:49.618
I’m heading back now.

00:51:51.126 --> 00:51:54.195
I know. I’ll pick up Clea later.

00:51:55.279 --> 00:51:56.459
Tonight, right?

00:51:58.184 --> 00:51:59.185
Yes, okay.

00:52:02.447 --> 00:52:04.574
Via, I’m sorry. I have to go.

00:52:04.574 --> 00:52:06.743
My manager doesn’t know
I stopped by here.

00:52:06.743 --> 00:52:09.829
Why? Where are you going?

00:52:13.208 --> 00:52:14.208
I’m just picking up—

00:52:14.214 --> 00:52:15.966
I’m just picking up Clea.

00:52:18.301 --> 00:52:19.302
We have a date.

00:52:19.302 --> 00:52:20.303
You know,

00:52:21.054 --> 00:52:22.347
management’s orders.

00:52:24.766 --> 00:52:25.767
Oh.

00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:30.897
Okay. Take care.

00:52:45.315 --> 00:52:46.315
Via?

00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:48.874
Why, Kino?

00:52:55.211 --> 00:52:56.382
Kino, why?

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:02.930
I love you.

00:53:05.432 --> 00:53:06.809
I love you so much.

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:13.941
Kino.

00:53:15.984 --> 00:53:17.528
I love you, too.

00:53:18.362 --> 00:53:21.240
I love you so much too.
Don’t cry.

00:53:22.527 --> 00:53:24.654
Don’t worry about me, okay?
I’m fine.

00:53:25.815 --> 00:53:27.520
I’m fine, I promise.

00:53:28.441 --> 00:53:30.665
What matters is that
you stay safe, okay?

00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:34.086
And keep me updated.

00:53:34.656 --> 00:53:35.656
I’m okay.

00:53:36.324 --> 00:53:37.325
I promise.

00:53:56.844 --> 00:53:57.943
Take care.

00:54:02.738 --> 00:54:04.323
Don’t cry anymore.

00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:07.451
I’ll go ahead.

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:08.971
Take care.

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:23.177
I didn’t get to
tell him about Spain.

00:54:23.663 --> 00:54:25.206
I’ll just tell him next time.

00:54:25.206 --> 00:54:27.514
He’ll probably
understand anyway.

00:54:43.066 --> 00:54:47.696
So you can properly hear
the songs I write for you.

00:54:49.198 --> 00:54:51.288
Even if we’re
not always together,

00:54:52.534 --> 00:54:55.579
You can hear and feel my love.

00:55:28.578 --> 00:55:29.880
- Look.
- Hey!

00:55:29.905 --> 00:55:30.906
Look, your idol.

00:55:30.906 --> 00:55:31.907
Hey, Via.

00:55:31.907 --> 00:55:33.325
Via, oh my gosh!

00:55:33.575 --> 00:55:35.869
Via! Have you seen this?

00:55:35.869 --> 00:55:38.288
Look, look. It’s making
me swoon. Look.

00:55:38.288 --> 00:55:39.998
Spotted: Larkin Sanchez
and Clea Aguilar

00:55:39.998 --> 00:55:41.541
on a sweet date,
sharing a kiss.

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.971
Nica! Nica, let me see!

00:55:48.973 --> 00:55:51.765
Oh, come on.
You already saw it earlier.

00:55:55.187 --> 00:55:56.520
It’s beautiful here, right?

00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:57.898
It really is.

00:55:58.315 --> 00:56:00.067
Happy anniversary, love.

00:56:00.985 --> 00:56:02.945
Why don’t you want
her in a love team?

00:56:02.945 --> 00:56:05.322
There’s a high chance
she might catch feelings

00:56:05.322 --> 00:56:06.696
for her love team partner.

00:56:07.196 --> 00:56:09.990
Enough with these love teams
turning into real-life couples.

00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:15.247
Larkin, are you
trying to court Clea?

00:56:15.496 --> 00:56:17.372
No, not yet, nothing like that.

00:56:17.372 --> 00:56:21.043
Not yet? So will it happen?

00:56:22.878 --> 00:56:24.797
About what happened
earlier with Clea,

00:56:24.797 --> 00:56:28.258
that was management’s order,
you know, just for promo.

00:56:30.429 --> 00:56:32.598
That was my first time seeing
Clea in person earlier.

00:56:32.805 --> 00:56:34.848
She really is beautiful.

00:56:34.848 --> 00:56:37.017
Are you sure you
never had a crush on her?

00:56:37.226 --> 00:56:38.226
My whole life,

00:56:38.234 --> 00:56:40.236
you’re the only one I’ve
ever had a crush on. Okay?

00:56:40.738 --> 00:56:43.866
So, Arkin, what’s the real
deal between you and Clea?

00:56:43.866 --> 00:56:45.910
I’m sure a lot of
your fans are curious.

00:56:48.078 --> 00:56:51.749
Well, I can say that our
relationship is very special to me.

00:56:51.749 --> 00:56:54.126
So, are you guys official now?

00:56:54.543 --> 00:56:56.253
You should ask Clea about that.

00:56:56.962 --> 00:56:59.506
You’re going to say in interviews
that you’re a couple?

00:56:59.506 --> 00:57:01.258
You’re going to tell everyone?

00:57:01.258 --> 00:57:02.718
You know this already.

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:04.428
Orders from the management.

00:57:04.428 --> 00:57:05.971
- I really can’t do anything.
- Fine! Okay, fine!

00:57:05.971 --> 00:57:08.724
Okay, management.
But what happens now?

00:57:09.099 --> 00:57:10.559
This is all just work.

00:57:10.559 --> 00:57:11.559
You know—

00:57:11.852 --> 00:57:13.938
You know you’re
the one I love, right?

00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:16.357
Via, I’d understand if—

00:57:17.608 --> 00:57:19.401
you can’t support me
on this anymore.

00:58:08.541 --> 00:58:12.044
Try to finish your shoot
early so you can come back

00:58:12.044 --> 00:58:14.004
right away and we can celebrate.

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.006
That’s a promise, okay?

00:58:16.006 --> 00:58:17.842
I swear on it.

00:58:18.342 --> 00:58:20.177
Cheers!

00:58:21.303 --> 00:58:23.681
Via, wait. You’re getting drunk.

00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:27.059
He probably doesn’t
love me anymore.

00:58:27.059 --> 00:58:29.728
It’s our anniversary today.
What time is it?

00:58:29.728 --> 00:58:31.605
But he’s still not here.
Where is he?

00:58:31.605 --> 00:58:33.899
He’s there. He’s there
with someone else.

00:58:33.899 --> 00:58:36.152
With another girl. I’m done.

00:58:36.152 --> 00:58:37.319
He loves you. He loves you.

00:58:39.391 --> 00:58:41.017
Stay right here beside me, okay?

00:58:42.811 --> 00:58:43.812
Of course.

00:58:44.688 --> 00:58:46.356
I will never leave you.

00:58:52.028 --> 00:58:53.405
And cut!

00:58:53.697 --> 00:58:54.698
Good take, Direk?

00:58:54.698 --> 00:58:56.116
- Such a good take.
- Good take!

00:58:56.116 --> 00:58:57.617
- Okay, okay.
- Okay guys, next scene.

00:58:57.617 --> 00:58:59.286
Thank you, I’ll go ahead.

00:58:59.286 --> 00:59:00.287
Larkin!

00:59:00.578 --> 00:59:02.580
- You were amazing. What happened?
- Thank you, Direk.

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:03.999
You’ve been doing everything
in one take today.

00:59:03.999 --> 00:59:05.250
Maybe it’s just my day, Direk.

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:06.250
You were amazing earlier—

00:59:06.255 --> 00:59:07.673
- Imagine all the awards you’re going to get.
- Direk.

00:59:07.673 --> 00:59:08.673
- Hey, I’ll make a—
- I’m just in a hurry.

00:59:08.675 --> 00:59:10.135
Yes, Direk.
Email it to me, okay?

00:59:10.135 --> 00:59:11.428
- Send it to me by email.
- Larkin, just to remind you

00:59:11.428 --> 00:59:12.428
about your upcoming schedule.

00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:14.009
Okay, I know.
I know, I know.

00:59:14.276 --> 00:59:15.276
Sir!

00:59:15.693 --> 00:59:16.372
Shit!

00:59:16.401 --> 00:59:17.035
Where are you now?
Are you still not done?

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:17.753
Are you gonna make it?
Should I keep waiting?

00:59:23.169 --> 00:59:24.503
Isn’t it beautiful here?

00:59:26.149 --> 00:59:27.150
It really is.

00:59:30.112 --> 00:59:31.694
Happy anniversary, love.

00:59:48.296 --> 00:59:49.297
Let’s go, love.

00:59:49.631 --> 00:59:51.129
- Huh?
- Come on.

00:59:51.154 --> 00:59:52.154
Why?

00:59:52.675 --> 00:59:56.009
We’re going somewhere else.
I prepared dinner for us.

00:59:58.056 --> 00:59:59.057
- Okay.
- Come on.

00:59:59.349 --> 01:00:00.349
Let’s go.

01:00:05.131 --> 01:00:06.797
Yes, sir, we’re already
working on it.

01:00:08.051 --> 01:00:09.051
Yes, sir.

01:00:32.701 --> 01:00:34.339
Sorry, I can’t kiss you.

01:00:34.911 --> 01:00:35.912
I can’t do it.

01:00:36.705 --> 01:00:39.666
Just stop crying,
for pete’s sake.

01:00:40.484 --> 01:00:41.915
Just make it look like we are.

01:00:51.594 --> 01:00:52.595
Yes.

01:00:53.325 --> 01:00:54.636
Good job.

01:00:55.692 --> 01:00:56.693
Yes.

01:01:04.111 --> 01:01:05.953
That’s good.
All right, guys.

01:01:05.958 --> 01:01:07.376
That’s good.
Good job, everyone.

01:01:18.429 --> 01:01:19.430
Clea?

01:01:20.063 --> 01:01:21.064
Via?

01:01:22.043 --> 01:01:23.044
I’m sorry.

01:01:24.123 --> 01:01:27.209
Via? Are you okay?

01:01:29.295 --> 01:01:30.562
I’m right here.

01:01:33.424 --> 01:01:34.691
Do you want to go outside?

01:01:36.802 --> 01:01:38.679
My sister didn’t ruin anything.

01:01:38.679 --> 01:01:40.723
What do you mean?
It’s all over social media

01:01:40.723 --> 01:01:41.974
that your sister is a mistress.

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:43.630
- Mira, what are you doing?
- Oh my.

01:01:43.637 --> 01:01:44.889
Here’s the mistress.

01:01:46.682 --> 01:01:48.809
I’m getting really mad at Arkin.

01:01:50.978 --> 01:01:52.563
Why isn’t he by your side?

01:01:53.606 --> 01:01:55.113
What are you doing here?

01:01:56.692 --> 01:01:57.692
Via, I’m sorry.

01:01:57.705 --> 01:01:59.499
This is the only way
for me to protect you

01:01:59.499 --> 01:02:02.377
from what you’re
most afraid of.

01:02:02.377 --> 01:02:04.754
How are you protecting me
with what you did, Larkin?

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:06.422
You just hurt me.

01:02:07.792 --> 01:02:09.377
Oh my gosh, it’s Larkin Sanchez!

01:02:09.377 --> 01:02:12.506
- Hey, it really is Arkin!
- Wait a second.

01:02:12.506 --> 01:02:14.064
Can I really live without him?
