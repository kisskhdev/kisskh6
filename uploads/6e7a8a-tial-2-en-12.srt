Housekeeper said the alarm
was still set when she got here.

I'd wonder if the killer laid in wait,

83
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,760
but if this was premeditated,
they'd have brought a weapon.

84
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,763
And if it was a crime of passion,
there would be signs of a fight,

the ferry got back to LA this morning,

99
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,303
and as soon as it did,
I checked Gabe's biodata,

100
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,597
and that's when I saw he didn't have any.

101
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:51,101
-You checked his biodata?
-Through the GeneGevity app.

102
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,686
That's Gabe's company.

00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,897
You can share vitals

I checked Gabe's every morning.

105

Seems very intimate
for an employer-employee relationship.

[exhales] Well, we were so much more.

Not-- Not like that.

108
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,538
When I met Gabe, I was struggling.

109
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,456
I-- I'd just lost my mom

110
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,586
and all my master's degree ever did
for me was land me in a ton of debt.

111
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,797
-What'd you get your degree in?
-19th-century art and textiles.

112

-Okay.
-Yeah.

113
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,470
Well, everything changed
after I went to one of Gabe's seminars.

114
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:31,016
He was so charismatic and alive.

115
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,227
His mission inspired me
to stop feeling sorry for myself

116
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,856
and make the most of my life,
and I've been working for him ever since.

117
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,399
What exactly was his mission?

118
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,319
Life extension.

119
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,655
GeneGevity is a pioneer in gene hacking.

120
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,158
Gabe believed that with the right diet,

121
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,412
exercise and self-care,
we could bypass the bad genes

122
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,540
and amp the good ones
to slow down the aging process

123
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,877
until eventually it stops altogether.

124
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,214
Gabe made himself the living proof.

125
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,550
He was showing the world that it worked.

126
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:10,513
In other words, the guy who was
trying to live forever just got murdered.

127
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:19,898
I wasn't just given the name
Healthiest Man on Earth.

128
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,024

that drives me nuts.

We're all supposed to think
that we can live like this guy.

00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,642
You know, I did a GeneGevity juice cleanse
once and I felt great after.

143
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,435
I even considered
signing up for the program,

144
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,646
but I was not comfortable
sending in bio samples.

145
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,981
-What's a bio sample?
-It comes off of you or out of you.

146
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,984
GeneGevity wants you to pop it
in the mail and send it on in.

147
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,903
-Moving on.
-You don't want to talk about poop?

148
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,822
Nope, enemies.

149
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,949
Other than the postal service,
I'm assuming,

150
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,617
who else might have had
an issue with old Gabe?

151
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:16,621
Pharmaceutical CEOs and doctors
all spoke out against GeneGevity,

152
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,791
but GeneGevity has done
a lot of good for a lot of people.

153
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,334
That's why his users are all fanatical.

154
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,753
Actually,
not all of Gabe's customers were fans.

155
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,797
I did a public record search.

156
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,173
In the last few months,

157
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:31,428
GeneGevity and Gabe were being sued
by a woman named Siobhan McBreyer.

158
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,222
-What did she sue them for? Huh.
-Child support.

159
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,641
We haven't seen anything
about Gabe having a child.

160
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,059
If he was keeping the child a secret

161
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,103
and McBreyer's lawsuits
weren't getting her anywhere,

162
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,814
-she may have been mad enough to kill.
-[Morgan] Mmm.

00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,692
A secret love child and revenge murder.

164
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,110
It's like a telenovela.

00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,571
Invite her in for a chat.

166

You mind going through Gabe's videos solo?

167

Let's see if there's
any other secrets he's hiding.

168
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,244
You got it.

00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,123
Ugh.

171
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,850
Excuse me. We're having a memorial
for my father here in a few days,

172
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,227
but his headstone
still hasn't been installed.

173
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,022
I'm sorry about that.
Are you sure it was ordered?

174
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,191
Yeah, my mother said
she ordered it months ago.

175
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,485
We install the monuments
the day we receive them.

176
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,528
You might want to check on that order.

177
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,033
Thanks.

178
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,542
Assistant's alibi checks out.

179
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,712
Spoke to multiple guests who saw
Renata at her sister's wedding.

180
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,258
Oh.

181
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,677
Siobhan McBreyer's here.

182
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,930
And she's off our suspect list.

183
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,932
-We don't know that.
-We don't?

184
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,683
She's about a thousand months pregnant,

185
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,603
and you think she got the jump
on the healthiest man alive?

186
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,523
Yeah, no.

187
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,818
Ms. McBreyer, thanks for coming in.

188
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,946
I'm Detective Karadec.
This is our consultant, Morgan Gillory.

189
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,031
We understand you are suing Gabe Rafferty?

190
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,366
Did he sic you on me?

191
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,868
Because I am within my rights to mail him

192
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,621
as many notices as I want
until he responds.

193
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,289
Well, that's not why we brought you in.

194
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,916
Mr. Rafferty's dead.

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,001
Oh.

196
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,463
Oh. [breathes heavily]

197
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,341
Of course he's dead.
It's great, it's great.

198
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,802
What happened to him? Hmm? Was it painful?

199
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,428
Please tell me it was painful.

200
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:41,474
Uh, it looked like
it was probably painful. Yeah.

201
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,769
You don't seem very upset for someone who
just lost the father of her unborn child.

202
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,980
Well, Gabe's not the father.
I never met the guy.

203
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,649
But you're suing him for child support?

204
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,193
He wasn't the baby's dad,
but he's still responsible for her.

205
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,320
What does this have to do
with child support?

206
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,614
My ex-husband didn't want kids.

207
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:00,827
I took the precautions,
and they worked until nine months ago,

208
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,164
and Andy accused me
of doing it on purpose.

209
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,623
So, he left?

210
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:09,460
Yeah. He was long gone before I even
thought to check the pills from GeneGevity

211
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,462
'cause that's when I saw
that the multivitamin was different

212
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,256
from the originals the company sent.

213
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,383
GeneGevity changed the pills
and didn't tell you?

214
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:19,596
They switched manufacturers to a cheaper
one that used different ingredients.

215
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,266
Did they add St. John's wort
to this new one?

216
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,350
Mm-hmm.

217
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,477
-And what is that?
-It's an herb.

218
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:29,105
People take it for depression
or skin irritations,

219
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,773
but it has a lot of drug interactions,

220
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,276
including messing up
your birth control pills,

221
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,904
which I'm assuming are
those precautions you're talking about.

222
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,448
Yeah. And the company
stopped taking my calls.

223
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,950
So I needed to get
their attention somehow.

224
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,911
So you sued them for child support.

225
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,412
First the company, then Gabe.

226
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,874
I didn't think I would win,
but I'd hoped to get him into court

227
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,586
so that I could talk to him face to face,
appeal to his humanity.

228
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,671
Look, I didn't kill Gabe.

229
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:58,676
I was furious with him, but not enough
to risk having this baby born in prison.

230
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,969
[inhales deeply] Whoa.

231
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,388
You know there's a more
comfortable couch right over here.

232
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,016
-Why don't you go sit down?
-Thanks. Thank you.

233
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,937
What the hell was Gabe thinking?

234
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,731
Herbal drug interactions are no joke,
and he would know that.

235
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,899
And for what?

236
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,443
So his billion-dollar company
could save a few hundred grand?

237
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,279
Well, maybe his company wasn't
as flush with money as we thought.

238
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,115
Let's pay GeneGevity a little visit.

239
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,121
Place doesn't look like
it's hurting for money.

240
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,206
[Karadec] Mmm.

241
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,626
-Ooh. Don't eat those.
-Why?

242
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,336
Bio samples.

243
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,545
Why so close?

244
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,966
I'm sorry,
GeneGevity is closed to visitors today.

245
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,592
We've suffered a loss.

246
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:40,677
That's why we're here.

247
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,263
We need to speak to whoever's
in charge of GeneGevity's finances.

248
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,139
That was Gabe.

249
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:48,601
Our board might be able to help,
but they're currently occupied.

250
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:52,605
They've gathered to share reflections
and grieve as a family.

251
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,148
-[glass shatters]
-[board member 1] Damn it!

252
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,401
-I told you this already!
-[board member 2] I don't believe you!

253
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,528
-You have a lot of nerve, you know that?
-I have a lot of nerve?

254
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,612
-Yeah, you do.
-That's funny…

255
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,490
Suppose every family reflects
and grieves in their own way.

256
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,867
-[board member 1] You do this every--
-No! Your words, your words.

257
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,995
-You knew what you were doing!
-You are delusional!

258
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,330
-The numbers don't lie!
-No! But you do!

259
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:13,876
Excuse me. Detective Karadec, LAPD.
How about we all just take a step back?

260
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,712
-Tell me what's going on here.
-Happy to.

261
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,463
My dear coworker Leona

262
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,633
is a manipulative resource hog
who had my lab programs killed.

263
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,177
I didn't kill your programs, Carter!

264
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,763
If anything, your bloated budget ate mine!

265
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,598
We were this close to a breakthrough!

266
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,434
Please. All those
secretive meetings with Gabe,

267
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,977
and then, boom, you get a new MRI machine?

268
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,604
I did not get an MRI machine, but you--

269
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,815
-Oh.
-Oh, what?

270
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,818
Neither of you got your equipment,
and I think I know why.

271
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,612
You guys familiar with the old phrase
"the check's in the mail"?

272
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:45,283
It's been a way to delay payment
since the invention of paper checks.

273
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,827
I'm so sorry. The check's in the mail.

274
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,497
Gabe was taking that old trick
one step further.

275
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,582
Check's in the mail.

276
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,168
On paper, he was buying goods
but wiring the funds to himself.

277
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,794
I sent it. The check's in the mail.

278
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,380
If the vendors got suspicious,
Gabe would just hit him with a…

279
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,715
The check's in the mail.

280
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,635
Gabe kept your department siloed
and the finances hidden,

281
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,887
and so you'd blame each other.

282
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,097
Wait, what are you saying?
Gabe was embezzling?

283
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,433
We're saying your boss
was bleeding GeneGevity dry

284
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,602
one fraudulent transaction at a time.

285
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,022
And if anyone here knew about it,
that's motive to kill.

286
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,947
No wonder Gabe never let anyone
near the books. GeneGevity's broke.

287
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,824
And you have no idea
what he did with the money?

288
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,993
No, this company was his life.

289
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,037
Well, it might have cost him his life.

290
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,123
-Where were the both of you last night?
-Here, working.

291
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,208
You can ask our staff.

292
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,795
Neither of us would kill Gabe.
We can vouch for each other.

293
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,380
You two were about to kill
each other when we walked in.

294
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,882
What's going on with this sudden truce?

295
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,093
'Cause we both care
about this company's mission.

296
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,552
Or what was our mission.

297
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,514
When the investors find out about
this fraud, they're gonna pull the money.

298
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,350
We're gonna need a list
of these investors so that we can--

299
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,185
[computers, phones chiming]

300
00:14:58,648 --> 00:14:59,690
You guys need to get that?

301
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,360
Uh, we got a video message.

302
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,486
It's from Gabe.

303
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:09,117
If you're receiving this message,
my natural life is over.

304
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,121
Upon my death,
hopefully many years from now,

305
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:17,166
I've instructed my attorneys to share
this message of love with you all.

306
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,419
What will follow
will be a period of change,

307
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:24,006
but rest assured, the most important
things will remain constant,

308
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,009
and you won't be out at sea
without a captain for long.

309
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,847
My successor will be in contact soon.

310
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,099
Live well, my friends.

311
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:36,727
Weird.

312
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,147
Any idea who this successor might be?

313
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,743
-Mom, you home?
-In here.

314
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,662
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

315
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,831
I would have had some food ready. [kisses]

316
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,292
-It's okay, I'm not hungry.
-Oh. You will eat.

317
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:04,297
-Oh. By the way, I ran into Nadia…
-Hmm?

318
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,551
…and apparently her son
wants to be a detective now.

319
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,928
Last week it was podcasts.
I can't keep up.

320
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,515
But I told her that
he could call you for advice.

321
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,600
Yeah, sure.

322
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,397
I went to the cemetery today.

323
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,232
Anne,

324
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,151
did you order Dad's headstone?

325
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,030
I know losing Dad has been hard, but we've
moved the memorial twice already.

326
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,242
If you need me to sort out the headstone,
I can do it.

327
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,873
Your father isn't gonna have a headstone.

328
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,416
What do you mean?

329
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,876
There's no money for it.

330
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,421
But you said you used Dad's life insurance
to pay for the funeral expenses.

331
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,216
I did. I-- Well, I-I-I thought I did.

332
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,762
I-I went to--
to meet with the funeral director,

333
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,849
made the arrangements,
uh, then there were more costs and…

334
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,103
so many decisions and…
I don't know what happened, but…

335
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,689
-Anne.
-The-- The money is gone.

336
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,486
Why didn't you tell me?

337
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:15,034
Because I'm embarrassed,
and I didn't want you to worry.

338
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,870
So, you thought it was better
just to wait for me to find out?

339
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,580
I'm sorry, Lev.

340
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,874
But we can still have the memorial.

341
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,542
Without a headstone?

342
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,337
Dad deserves better than that.

343
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,130
[breathes shakily]

344
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,261
[sighs]

345
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,312
So, your mom called me this morning.

346
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,150
She said you two had a fight, and since
you weren't picking up your phone,

347
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,152
she wanted me to see if you were okay.

348
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,697
It wasn't a fight, and I'm fine.

349
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,532
Are you sure?

350
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,200
'Cause, look, it just seems like you--

351
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,536
Daph, I really don't want to
talk about it if that's okay.

352
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,498
-Sorry.
-Okay.

353
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,959
What do you got for me?

354
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,504
Uh, the financial crimes team
looked into GeneGevity's books

355
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,006
and Gabe's personal finances.

356
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,049
Gabe was definitely embezzling
from the company,

357
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,051
but he wasn't keeping
the money for himself.

358
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:17,096
No vanity purchases like cars or boats.
No gambling debts either.

359
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,222
So, what was he buying?

360
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,724
At first, other companies.

361
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,309
Most of them make sense for him.

362
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,437
Neural brain tech start-ups,
software companies, a skincare brand.

363
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,565
Then a year ago he bought a nursing home
in Santa Clarita. Brookville Manor.

364
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,151
Since then,
all the money he stole went there.

365
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,154
So, a 55-year-old who was healthier
than most 25-year-olds

366
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,739
bought a nursing home? For what?

367
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,574
-No idea.
-Hmm.

368
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,161
Well, I guess I'm picking up Morgan
on my way to Santa Clarita.

369
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,583
Millions of dollars
of stolen money spent on this?

370
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,793
I didn't see anything on the website
about it being closed,

371
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,170
but this place looks abandoned.

372
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,434
[Morgan] Excuse me.

373
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,271
I'm Detective Karadec.
This is Morgan Gillory.

374
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,231
Jesse Lascala.

375
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:13,069
-Mr. Lascala, did you know Gabe Rafferty?
-Yes, I worked for him.

376
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,279
We have reason to believe that
Mr. Rafferty was funneling

377
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,907
large sums of money to this facility,
but there are no patients here.

378
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,617
Where was the money going exactly?

379
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,912
To the therapy team,
physical, occupational speech.

380
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,706
It's why Gabe purchased Brookville Manor.

381
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,751
We have the best specialists
and equipment in the country.

382
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,880
He relocated the residents
so he could have our full focus.

383
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:36,884
Okay. Uh, but by all accounts,
Gabe was incredibly healthy.

384
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,761
Why would he need therapists?

385
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,180
To help him reach
his full human potential.

386
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,808
[gasps] Oh. What the hell does that mean?

387
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,477
Let me show you.

388
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,903
Are we in a morgue?

389
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,613
I don't think these are actual bodies.

390
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,324
[mechanical whirring]

391
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,577
Explain. Quickly.

392
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,997
It's best if Gabe explains for himself.

393
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,207
Gabe?

394
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,001
Gabe, you have visitors.

395
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,087
-[machine chimes]
-[Gabe] How wonderful.

396
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,382
Please, join me.

397
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,978
So, how's this work?
We supposed to push a button or something?

398
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,772
We can continue on our own, Jesse.
Thank you.

399
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:35,860
Ms. Gillory, Detective Karadec,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

400
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,529
How do you know who we are?

401
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,365
I scanned your faces and ran it through
facial recognition software.

402
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,159
Mm-mmm. Don't like that.

403
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,744
Now, I'm assuming
you're here about my death.

404
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:45,828
You know you're dead?

405
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,498
Well, I know my physical body is gone,
yes, but that doesn't mean that I'm dead.

406
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,500
-No, it does though.
-I'm pretty sure it does.

407
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:55,254
Perhaps at one time that was true,
but with advancements in technology,

408
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,965
we can exist far beyond
our corporeal reality.

409
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,133
I'm proof of that.

410
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,011
But the lack of a physical presence
can be unsettling,

411
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,221
so I'm taking steps to remedy that.

412
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:07,641
Aha. So that's why the crash test dummies.

413
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,686
I prefer humanoid robot replica.

414
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,148
Hang on, are you trying to
put yourself into one of these?

415
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,357
Ugh.

416
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,819
[exclaims] Look.

417
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,989
-Weird.
-So this is why you bankrupted GeneGevity?

418
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,073
For some robots?

419
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:26,076
I regret the steps
I had to take to get here.

420
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,829
It's taken more time
and resources than I planned,

421
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:32,625
but my depth of knowledge has
the potential to help millions of people.

422
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,586
It would be a waste if it died with me.
Now it never will.

423
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,754
What does that mean?

424
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,508
Every email, text, video
and book I've ever read

425
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:43,135
or written was uploaded into this form.

426
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:46,138
Hang on, are you saying that
everything that Gabe knew, you know?

427
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,223
Yes.

428
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,892
Okay.

429
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,229
Um, first question, who killed you?

430
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,105
-I can't answer that.
-[clicks tongue] Shoot.

431
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,276
I can't believe we're doing this.

432
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:01,904
Okay.

433
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:06,075
Other than the, uh, users and investors
you've defrauded,

434
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,576
did Gabe have any enemies?

435
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,705
I've received a few death threats
over the years, none I found serious.

436
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:16,252
May 2011, December 2015, March 2020,
August 2024.

437
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,172
I also received other less
directly threatening messages.

438
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,050
-I've dropped the list to your phones.
-[phones buzz]

439
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,595
-Really? [gasps]
-We'll look at those.

440
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,722
Meantime,
your routine the day you were killed,

441
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,474
was there anything unusual about it?

442
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,476
I assume I followed my normal routine.

443
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,397
Awake at 7:00, self-care protocols,
GeneGevity work,

444
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,774
meditation at 9:00 p.m.,
and then in bed right after.

445
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,943
Well, did you ever go to bed
in your meditation room?

446
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,821
No. A strict sleep routine is essential.

447
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,992
That's why the house is set to go into
Do Not Disturb mode promptly at 10:15.

448
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,410
10:15? No.

449
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,371
The panel at your house said
Do Not Disturb went on at 9:00 p.m.

450
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,790
Why would it be any different
on the day you were killed?

451
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,585
My operating system is connected
to my home's monitoring system.

452
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,503
-Let me check.
-[machine chimes]

453
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:03,966
My password was used
to adjust the Do Not Disturb at 9:05.

454
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,718
So Gabe did change the settings.

455
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,470
No, it wasn't me. I was in the house.

456
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,557
So, are you saying someone
accessed the panel remotely? Who?

457
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,892
Let me che… Let me che…

458
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,895
[distorted warbling]

459
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,653
Uh, Jesse, Gabe died.

460
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,700
You're telling me
there are no headstone companies

461
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,828
closer to Los Angeles than Italy?

462
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,872
I get that's what she ordered, but I…

463
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,919
You know what, how about I stop
by your funeral home after my shift

464
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,005
as a police detective,
and then we have a chat?

465
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,133
No, it's not a threat,
just a conversation.

466
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:49,428
-We'll clear this up face to face.
-Detective Ozdil. A word, please.

467
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,683
[sighs]

468
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,605
I'm sorry, Lieutenant. I should have
stepped out to take that call.

469
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,857
-Won't happen again.
-You're not in trouble, Oz.

470
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,323
I'm worried about you.

471
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:10,908
What's going on?

472
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,204
Okay. Um…

473
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:22,002
The $20,000 headstone my mother bought for
my dad is stuck in a shipping container

474
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:27,633
in Genoa, racking up export fees she can't
pay because the insurance money is gone.

475
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,427
$20,000.

476
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,264
-I don't know what she was thinking.
-She probably wasn't thinking.

477
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:35,975
Not clearly anyway.

478
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:39,603
It sounds like the funeral home took
advantage of her and she was upsold.

479
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:40,896
It's disgusting.

480
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,775
But unfortunately common.
It's not her fault.

481
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,026
It's my fault.

482
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:47,903
I wasn't there.

483
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:53,409
My dad, he was always there for us.

484
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,997
After he died, I should have stepped up
like he always did, but I just…

485
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,750
My mom had to handle everything.

486
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:05,796
The paperwork, the funeral,
the hospital, all of it alone.

487
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,841
I mean, what kind of son lets that happen?

488
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,843
A grieving one.

489
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,178
When my mom passed, I was lost.

490
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:16,515
I was suddenly the matriarch
of my big, complicated family.

491
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,017
It was a lot.

492
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:23,856
And the one person I always counted on
to get me through

493
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,567
when life got tough
was the one that was gone.

494
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,236
How'd you get through it?

495
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,074
The same way you will.

496
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,159
With time.

497
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:41,123
But healing only happens when you
stop inflicting yourself with new wounds.

498
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,710
Yeah.

499
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,049
Thanks, Lieutenant.

500
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,511
So, the robot gave you the lead?

501
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,221
Yes, and I know how that sounds.

502
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:59,349
Gabe Two gave us a list of digital threats
that Gabe received.

503
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,643
Over the past few months,
the only person capable

504
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,730
and angry enough to take down the bot
was the founder of a startup

505
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,023
that Gabe bought and then shuttered.

506
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,691
A guy named Mika Astor.

507
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:12,821
You want me to pick him up for boticide?
[scoffs] The lieutenant's gonna love that.

508
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:16,325
Actually, we think that Gabe
and Gabe Two's murders were related.

509
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,826
Jesse said when the bot went down,

510
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,079
it looked like when he'd seen
Gabe Two being rebooted.

511
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,498
Only a few people have
the skill to do that remotely.

512
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,083
Whoever overrode the bot's securities

513
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,918
could've done the same
with Gabe's home network.

514
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,295
Okay. I'll bring Mika in
and see what he knows.

515
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,762
I've advised my client not to speak.

516
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,597
All questions are to be directed to me.

517
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,848
Wonderful.

518
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,017
Your client owned a company, Chatabelle,

519
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,894
that was sold eight months ago
to Gabe Rafferty.

520
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,187
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

521
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,356
Chatabelle specialized
in a language learning software

522
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,525
for "companion experiences."

523
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,528
In other words, AI virtual girlfriends.

524
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,948
[chuckles] That is so reductive.

525
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,575
I provided a cutting edge
invaluable service to thousands of--

526
00:26:58,659 --> 00:26:59,952
Mika.

527
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,580
[sighs]

528
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,958
Gabe bought Chatabelle
from you for a hefty price tag.

529
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,503
But then you started harassing him
to sell you the company back.

530
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,296
This is a business matter.

531
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,757
Why is Major Crimes so interested?

532
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,718
Gabe Rafferty was recently murdered
in his secure home.

533
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:20,681
Your client had the motive and ability to
spoof Gabe's password and enter his house.

534
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,099
[lawyer] That's ridiculous.

535
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,267
Mika's a genius.

536
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,479
He would never throw his life away
over something as trivial as one start-up.

537
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,524
You didn't think it was trivial, did you?
Chatabelle was important to you.

538
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,984
You wanted it back to right a wrong.

539
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,318
-It was my company.
-Mika.

540
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,320
Chatabelle was everything to me.

541
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,823
Gabe said he'd let me come work for him
so I could still be a part of it.

542
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,283
But instead he pushed you out.

543
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,535
After he made me sign a noncompete clause.

544
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,037
Five years.

545
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,832
That's a death sentence
in this industry.

546
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:50,085
[chuckles]
I brought that stupid bot to life.

547
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,170
And you had every right to take it out.

548
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:56,008
What about human Gabe?
You take him out too?

549
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:06,101
According to Gabe Two's records,
someone accessed the panel at 9:00 p.m.

550
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,648
Why are these plants dying?

551
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:14,526
Gabe's got plants all over the house.
They're as healthy as he is.

552
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,777
What's going on with these?

553
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,867
[door locks]

554
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,911
-[Karadec] Oh.
-What'd you do?

555
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:29,291
Not sure, honestly,
but I think whoever was messing

556
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,753
with the Do Not Disturb mode
also set it to lock this door.

557
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,796
So somebody wanted to lock Gabe in here.
Why?

558
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,798
Maybe they stabbed him,
wanted him to bleed out

559
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,300
without any chance of getting help.

560
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,973
Did the ME email you the report?

561
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,184
Yeah. What do you need to know?

562
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,019
Did it say anything
about his nasal passages?

563
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,606
Nasal passages showed
signs of inflammation. His throat too.

564
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,566
ME seems to think
it might have been a reaction

565
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,235
to the steroidal nasal spray he used.

566
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,947
No, it was a reaction to something else.

567
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,283
An intruder didn't stab Gabe.
Gabe stabbed himself.

568
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:04,493
[scoffs] Why would he do that?

569
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,995
Because he preferred it
to the alternative.

570
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,247
Dead bugs, scorched plants.

571
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,583
I think I know what happened.

572
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:14,086
Someone rigged this room
to fill with toxic gas

573
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,963
and locked Gabe in here with it.

574
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,090
He tried to get out,
but there was no escape.

575
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,968
The symptoms of it
must have been excruciating

576
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:24,846
if Gabe was willing to choose killing
himself over his dreams of immortality.

577
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,769
[gas whooshing]

578
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,941
You think the gas was set to go off
when the Do Not Disturb was triggered?

579
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,693
And we just triggered it again.

580
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,747
Thanks, Selena.

581
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,209
Soto's sending a team over here to
get us out. They'll be here soon.

582
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,336
-How soon?
-As quickly as possible.

583
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,921
Well, that's not fast enough.

584
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,007
We don't even know where
this gas is coming from.

585
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,926
It could be coming from here,
it could be from any of these things.

586
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,804
[stammers] The vents,
or there could be, like, a-a hidden pipe

587
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:09,349
that we don't know about, or it
could be coming up through the floor.

588
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,518
I hear you, but still,
it doesn't make any sense to panic.

589
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,103
It's not panic. I'm not panicking.

590
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,397
It's the… That's just math.
It's a ten-by-ten room.

591
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,025
We've got oxygen plus carbon dioxide
times two people breathing it,

592
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,276
plus whatever gas this is.

593
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,611
That doesn't add up to much time
is all I'm saying, okay?

594
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,864
If I knew what the gas was,
I could come up with a plan,

595
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:24,948
but we don't know that.

596
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:28,326
But what we do know is that a person
who wanted to live forever

597
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,411
chose to end his own life

598
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,705
rather than suffer
whatever this gas was going to do to him.

599
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:35,083
-So, what exactly does that do for us?
-Morgan.

600
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,544
-I just ne… Leave me alone for a second.
-Morgan.

601
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:41,339
Please leave me alone for a second.
I gotta think. I just… I need to think.

602
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,133
How do we get out of here?

603
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,595
[breathes heavily]

604
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,682
Morgan, you have to slow down.
Just take a breath.

605
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,810
A breath? Taking a breath is not what
we should be doing right now.

606
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:57,105
-How are you so calm?
-Because panicking doesn't help.

607
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,524
Okay. Well, neither does
just standing there.

608
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,651
I gotta do the
"five, four, three, two, one" thing.

609
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,529
I need five things I can see. I can see…

610
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:05,822
Uh…

611
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:09,201
A salt lamp and a bowl and matches.
A dead…

612
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,078
Dying plants. How many was that?

613
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,496
-Morgan--
-Four. Stop.

614
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:16,708
I gotta ground. Four things I can…
I can touch. I touch the floor.

615
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,794
I don't know if the floor counts as one.

616
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,129
What is the name of that stool?
That stool has a name.

617
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,423
You know who'd know the name
of that stool?

618
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,802
[crying] Elliot would know the name
of that. He really loves stuff like this.

619
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,763
He's such a smart boy, but he's not
gonna be able to understand this.

620
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,267
Oh, God! Ava already had one parent
leave her. I can't leave her.

621
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:37,854
-You are not going to leave her--
-Stop! Three things I hear.

622
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,315
Three things I hear.
I can't smell anything.

623
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,901
Chloe is just a baby.
You don't understand.

624
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,529
She needs her mom, and she's a baby.

625
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:49,741
-You're not gonna be leaving your--
-I can't… I… I can't breathe.

626
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,493
Adam, I can't breathe. Stop! Leave it!

627
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,870
-I can't breathe! Please don't.
-It's okay.

628
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:56,248
-It's okay.
-[crying] It's not okay.

629
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,668
I'm right here.
Morgan, it's gonna be okay. I've got you.

630
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,587
-[breathes heavily]
-I'm not going anywhere.

631
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,966
It's okay. I've got you.
I'm not gonna let you go.

632
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,301
-[breathing heavily]
-I got you.

633
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,554
I'm not going anywhere.

634
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,557
I got you. I'm not letting you go.

635
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,980
It's okay.

636
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,025
It's okay.

637
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,864
You're okay.

638
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,283
You're okay.

639
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,371
[gasps] Oh.

640
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,165
You're okay.

641
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,000
See?

642
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:43,461
[whimpering]

643
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,089
[phone buzzing]

644
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,803
Selena? Yeah. Yeah, the door is open.

645
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,222
We're fine. Okay.

646
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,390
All right, I will.

647
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,602
Soto got Mika
to, uh, access the doors remotely.

648
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,853
Mirror neurons.

649
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,939
-What?
-It's a…

650
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:07,068
It's just an unconscious,
empathetic brain response. Like a yawn.

651
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,655
Your breathing
and your heart rate were calm,

652
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:13,950
so they calmed mine down,
so… [whimpers] …thank you.

653
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,787
So, um, you're good?

654
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,956
Yeah, I'm good. Let's get back to work.

655
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,959
Okay, so we didn't drop dead.

656
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,169
That's exciting.

657
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,339
Maybe the gas needed more time
to fill up the room.

658
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,094
Or maybe the door locking
isn't what triggered it.

659
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:38,600
[Renata] I checked Gabe's biodata
through the GeneGevity app.

660
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,101
[Karadec] No forced entry.

661
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,771
Housekeeper said the alarm was still set
when she got here.

662
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,565
You're right.

663
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,069
Gabe triggered it.

664
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,737
But he was set up.

665
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,365
I know who did it.

666
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,581
-Thanks for coming in.
-Anything I can do for Gabe.

667
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:05,168
That's sweet.
That's not anything new though, is it?

668
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,837
You've been helping Gabe out
for about eight years.

669
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,131
Well, I like to think
we were helping each other.

670
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,801
I mean, Gabe was such an amazing person.

671
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,929
That would be much easier to believe
if you weren't the one that killed him.

672
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:20,058
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I wasn't even in LA when Gabe was killed.

673
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,268
You didn't need to be.

674
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:24,479
The ME confirmed that there were traces
of arsenic in Gabe's airways.

675
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,064
He inhaled it before he died.

676
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,775
Which is an odd way
to get arsenic into your body.

677
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:32,028
Arsenic was once referred to
as "inheritance powder"

678
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:35,031
because of its use in getting rid
of unwanted family members.

679
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:38,368
Then, for a while, copper arsenite
became the dye of choice

680
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,453
for those looking to up
their fashion game.

681
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,163
They called it Scheele's green.

682
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,499
Especially once
incandescent light bulbs showed up.

683
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,876
People really wanted their dresses to pop.

684
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,253
That didn't work out so well.

685
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,797
But clothes weren't the only thing
people used the dye in.

686
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,885
It snuck into candy,
wallpaper, and for a while… candles.

687
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:59,764
Only trouble was, burning the candles
released arsenic gas into the air,

688
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,975
but you already knew that, didn't you?

689
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,854
Your study of 19th-century arts
and textiles taught you all about it.

690
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,524
The candles provided the perfect cover.
When Gabe lit them and released the gas,

691
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,610
you were at your sister's wedding
on Catalina.

692
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,070
And that timing was very poetic,
wasn't it?

693
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:17,532
Because your sister is part of the reason
you wanted Gabe dead.

694
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:21,077
-I don't understand any of this.
-Yeah, you do.

695
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:25,373
You see this scar?
That's a port scar from chemotherapy.

696
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,918
Your sister is undergoing cancer
treatment. She has breast cancer.

697
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:32,797
The same cancer that took your mother, the
same cancer you're worried about getting.

698
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:36,843
GeneGevity was researching the BRCA genes
that you and your family carry.

699
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,094
Or they were

700
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:41,139
until Gabe started embezzling funds
and they had to shut down the program.

701
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:44,559
Gabe betrayed you,
and you returned the favor.

702
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:48,188
Mika's already confessed. He said
he's the one that told you about the box.

703
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:53,068
He came by Gabe's house looking to get his
company back, and you two hatched a plan.

704
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,528
[Morgan] He had the skills
to clone Gabe's passwords.

705
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:59,240
All he needed to know from you was when
to remotely deploy the Do Not Disturb.

706
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:03,995
And since Gabe follows a strict routine,
it really wasn't a difficult ask.

707
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,664
[Karadec] You waited
until you had an alibi

708
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:09,167
and swapped out Gabe's regular meditation
candles for the ones with the green dye,

709
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,419
knowing his housekeeper
changes them daily.

710
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,171
[Morgan] And Gabe took care of the rest.

711
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:22,180
I was upset when I found out GeneGevity
had shut down the BRCA research,

712
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:26,726
but when Mika told me what Gabe
was actually spending the money on,

713
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,436
I was livid.

714
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,440
A robot of himself.

715
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,776
I mean, I… I couldn't believe it.

716
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,405
I confronted him about it,
and you know what he said?

717
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,824
"Sacrifices have to be made."

718
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:45,286
My sister and I aren't sacrifices
that he gets to make.

719
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,205
He was stealing our future.

720
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,749
So you decided that Gabe
shouldn't have a future either.

721
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,710
Maybe with Gabe
and his bot out of the way,

722
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,671
GeneGevity can get back on track.
They can start their research again

723
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:58,216
and give people like me and my sister
a fighting chance.

724
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,263
Gabe deserved to die.

725
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,566
[door opens]

726
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,153
[door closes]

727
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,075
You know, I never thought of you
as the sentimental type.

728
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,706
I am so surprised you kept this.

729
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:33,084
But why? It was a gift, right?

730
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,172
Do you remember what you said
when I gave it to you?

731
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,593
-[sighs] No.
-Nothing.

732
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,098
You just stared at it
for the longest time.

733
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:52,854
And then when you finally looked up at me,
you had this expression on your face

734
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,274
like you weren't really sure
it was for you.

735
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,698
I didn't think I deserved it.

736
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,326
Or you.

737
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,954
And now?

738
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,543
Lucia, honestly, I don't know.

739
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,380
I hope I've changed enough
to be who you need, but--

740
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,842
Adam, you were always who I needed.

741
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:26,054
I wasn't the one who needed
to be convinced of that.

742
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,974
You broke my heart
when you called off our engagement.

743
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,979
But I think you broke yours too.

744
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,821
I don't want to hurt you again.

745
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,451
Then don't.

746
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,912
[♪ ballad plays]

747
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,132
-It's--
-Perfect.

748
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,135
Dad would have been proud.

749
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,430
[speaks Turkish]

750
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,272
Rumor is you pulled some strings.

751
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,109
The funeral home just happens to be

752
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,694
-on my way home from work.
-Mmm.

753
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:27,323
And in violation of the FTC rules
against predatory price gouging.

754
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:30,285
-That could cost them their license.
-Yeah, it could.

755
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,829
But they generously offered Mrs. Ozdil
a full refund,

756
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,707
and they gave her the headstone
she actually wanted.

757
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,420
I thank you all for being here.

758
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,257
Not all of you met my dad.

759
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,469
But I can tell you
he would have loved you.

760
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:50,597
Talked your ear off.

761
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,683
Had us all laughing till the sun came up.

762
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,062
He used to tell me that all of this…

763
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,816
doesn't last forever.

764
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:05,737
That's the point.

765
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,115
It takes loss to really know
what you have.

766
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,035
Family.

767
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,078
Friends.

768
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,999
Friends who become family.

769
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,672
You gotta hold them all
just a little tighter.

770
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,135
Life is beautiful because it's brief…

771
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,847
and death…

772
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,977
is just the beginning of something new.

[♪ song continues]

774
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,206
-It was a nice service.
-Yeah, it was.

775
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,416
It's good that we could be here for Oz.

776
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,921
Okay. You, uh…

777
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,633
have a good day, partner.

778
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:12,095
-That was really weird.
-Yeah, well, it's weird. I feel weird.

779
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,474
I'm horrified about
what happened at Gabe's.

780
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,267
I just completely fell apart.

781
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,812
And it's not something I typically love
doing in front of other people.

782
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,730
Well, I'm not other people.
I'm your partner.

783
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:26,150
Yeah, that's worse. You should be able
to count on me when we're in trouble.

784
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,236
I just was a giant useless mess.

785
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,697
Are you really apologizing
for being human, Morgan?

786
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,699
Come on, we're a team.
We count on each other.

787
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,993
-You would've done the same for me.
-When?

788
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,912
In what world is Adam Karadec
falling apart on the job?

789
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,581
Well, just 'cause it hasn't happened yet
doesn't mean that it won't.

790
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,544
And when that time comes, I know that,
out of all the people in my life,

791
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,713
you will know exactly what to do.
