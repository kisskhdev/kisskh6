00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:31,351
seeing you again.

00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:33,852

Look, it’s my dude, Larkin.

00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:40,526
He’s here to welcome you.

8
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:43,737
There. These are the clothes,

9
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:46,448
and those are
the groceries I bought.

10
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:49,284
And we’ll also buy you your
own guitar so you’ll have one.

Aidan, do you need a capo—

13
00:02:57,835 --> 00:02:58,919
Hey, miss.

14
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:02,548
You forgot something.

15
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:08,595
Architect, your idea is spot on.

16

- You okay?

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,493
- I’m okay.
- Via, are you okay?

18
00:03:14,518 --> 00:03:15,828
Yes, I’m okay. Don’t worry.

We need to go, Clea.

20
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:19,690
We need to finish
all the sequences

who wants to confess their
love to their closest friend.

But at the same time—

37
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:41,456
too afraid to lose
everything they have.

38
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:49,047
It was nice...

I came here to give you this.

51
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,917
You left it.

52
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:06,578
I meant to leave that behind.

53

Go with them to the mall.

80
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:28,350
Come on.
Go with your siblings.

81
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,168
They’ve been nagging
since yesterday.

82
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,345
Arkin has a mall show tomorrow.

83
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:34,517
At the same mall.

84
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:36,431
Should we go out tomorrow instead?

85
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:37,619
Let’s watch him!

86
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:39,854
You guys go ahead.

87
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:42,729
Just kidding.
I keep seeing Arkin, anyway.

88
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:46,608
You keep seeing him?

89
00:13:46,983 --> 00:13:50,487
Via, you should
also visit Auntie Allie.

90
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:51,863
They miss you there.

91
00:13:52,655 --> 00:13:55,502
How can I visit if Arkin’s there too?

92
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:58,078
We need to finish
all the sequences

93
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:00,622

a shoot until next week.

94
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:01,915
All right.

95
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:03,666
I’ll visit on the weekend.

96
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:06,836
Come on, let’s go
to the mall now.

97
00:14:06,836 --> 00:14:08,755
Get ready, take a shower.

98
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:12,759
I’ll need to buy a gift
to take to Auntie Allie.

99
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:13,927
- Okay, okay, let’s go!
- Okay, Via.

100
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:15,002
Let’s go.

101
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:19,724
Hi, Clea. I’m done with
the revisions on the design.

102
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:21,351
Let me know
when we can meet.

103
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:23,561
Hi, Architect.
I’ll check my schedule.

104
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:25,563
Maybe I can go to your office.

105
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:29,359
Oh, by the way,
Larkin is asking about his umbrella.

106
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:31,069
Oh, okay.

107
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:34,489
Arkin said that you
should return his umbrella.

108
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:37,617
Not you, too?

109
00:14:40,703 --> 00:14:45,333
“All I want is for you
to come back.” — me to my umbrella.

110
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:49,337
Good morning!

111
00:14:49,337 --> 00:14:50,463
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

112
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:51,464
Good morning!

113
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:56,636
Umbrella for the bag.

114
00:14:56,636 --> 00:14:58,221
Another umbrella for the bag.

115
00:15:00,306 --> 00:15:01,891
Umbrella for the house.

116
00:15:02,517 --> 00:15:05,103
I’ll never run out
of umbrellas in my life.

117
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:08,022
Did he really think
I wouldn’t return his umbrella?

118
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:12,652
Are you okay, Architect?

119
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:17,866
Of course! I’m fine.

120
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:18,955
Back to work, guys.

121
00:15:23,538 --> 00:15:25,081
Umbrellas…

122
00:15:33,173 --> 00:15:36,259
Hi, Architect! Sorry,
but can we do the presentation

123
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:37,886
on set instead?

124
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:40,722
This is the only
free time I have this month.

125
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:44,767
I might see him there again,

126
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:48,605
but I have no choice.
I need to finish this project.

127
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:50,769
I don’t want to delay it any further.

128
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:57,530
Okay. See you.

129
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:20,011
So he’s actually here?

130
00:16:20,386 --> 00:16:22,305
I hope they don’t recognize me.

131
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:24,766
I don’t want what happened
before to happen again.

132
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:35,652
Are you Architect Diaz?

133
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,279
I’m Ma’am Clea’s
personal assistant.

134
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,822
She’s just finishing a scene.

135
00:16:39,822 --> 00:16:41,199
This way, please.

136
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,119
For Ma’am Clea.

137
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:55,296
Is that her?

138
00:16:55,296 --> 00:16:56,631
It is.

139
00:16:57,428 --> 00:16:58,429
Action!

140
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:01,970
I can’t get you out of my head.

141
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,930
Ma’am, please wait here.
We’re rolling.

142
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:07,684
In that case—

143
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:12,480
this will make it
harder for you.

144
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:17,805
Why am I even here?

145
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:26,703
Cut!

146
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:29,747
One more take.

147
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:31,165
Arkin, I need to feel it, okay?

148
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:32,208
I’m not feeling it.

149
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,810
You have to kiss her
passionately.

150
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:35,378
You have to be
hungry for her, got it?

151
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:36,729
I’m not feeling anything.

152
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:38,923
All right. Arkin, we’ll pick up
from that last part?

153
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:40,842
“I can’t get you out of my head.”

154
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:43,136
Standby slate.
We’ll do another take!

155
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,596
Sound!

156
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:46,097
Camera? Rolling.

157
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:47,640
Take two.

158
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,616
Mark—

159
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:49,642
And—

160
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:50,643
Three, two, one—

161
00:17:52,478 --> 00:17:53,501
Action!

162
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:56,858
I can’t get you out of my head.

163
00:17:58,151 --> 00:17:59,444
In that case,

164
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:01,946
this will make it harder for you.

165
00:18:08,494 --> 00:18:09,495
Cut!

166
00:18:09,912 --> 00:18:10,997
It’s terrible! Damn it!

167
00:18:10,997 --> 00:18:13,249
Arkin, what is happening to you?

168
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:14,417
Oh my gosh!

169
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:15,418
We’ve been going over
this again and again.

170
00:18:15,418 --> 00:18:16,419
Where are you even looking?

171
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:18,254
Do you see something I don’t?

172
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:21,132
Over and over.
We’re wasting time.

173
00:18:21,716 --> 00:18:23,259
It should be so simple.
What’s happening?

174
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:25,386
The woman is actually
the one leading you.

175
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:26,304
Is this your first time
doing a kissing scene?

176
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:27,555
It’s not, right?

177
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:29,349
Sorry, Director.

178
00:18:29,724 --> 00:18:30,725
Come on, now!

179
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:33,770
Why did I even agree
to meet Clea here?

180
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,606
We’re victims of fate again.

181
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:37,774
Okay, Director.

182
00:18:37,774 --> 00:18:38,941
Focus, please.

183
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:40,943
I’ll just wait for her outside.

184
00:18:41,444 --> 00:18:42,446
Excuse me.

185
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:46,449
What a waste of time.

186
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:48,910
One more retouch.

187
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,078
- This is the last, okay?
- Yes, Director.

188
00:18:50,078 --> 00:18:51,204
So annoying.

189
00:18:52,997 --> 00:18:56,042
This is so great. I love it.

190
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:58,044
Thank you so much, Architect.

191
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:00,588
You really captured
everything I wanted.

192
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:01,756
Is this approved?

193
00:19:01,756 --> 00:19:04,300
Yeah! We can start
the construction soon.

194
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,345
Great.

195
00:19:06,844 --> 00:19:09,806
Finally, I don’t have to go
to their set anymore.

196
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:12,058
I’ll just be at the construction
site all the time.

197
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:19,857
Why is he here?

198
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,654
Is this his dressing room too?

199
00:19:29,742 --> 00:19:30,877
What’s wrong, Larkin?

200
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:32,320
You seem distracted today.

201
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:35,248
Lack of sleep.

202
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:38,174
I thought I was
already seeing things.

203
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:40,044
Like what?

204
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:42,547
Like my ex.

205
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:47,427
Now, I know I’m not
seeing things.

206
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:49,846
Come on.

207
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:52,557
We’re all professionals
here and also—

208
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:55,059
Architect Diaz is
designing my house.

209
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,771
Okay.

210
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,529
Miss Clea? You’re called on set.

211
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:07,535
Okay.

212
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:10,283
Sir Larkin, it’s time to
change for the next scene.

213
00:20:10,283 --> 00:20:11,301
Okay.

214
00:20:11,951 --> 00:20:13,578
Thank you so
much again, Architect.

215
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:15,371
I’ll see you on-site?

216
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:16,355
Yeah.

217
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,375
I’ll just send my assistant
to show you the way out.

218
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,168
Yeah.

219
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:21,252
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

220
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,475
What?

221
00:20:35,475 --> 00:20:37,059
What are you staring at?

222
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:39,103
I’m changing.

223
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:40,688
This is the dressing
room, remember?

224
00:20:41,898 --> 00:20:42,732
Right.

225
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:45,777
See, I’m leaving now.

226
00:21:28,402 --> 00:21:29,403
What?

227
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:56,967
Where’s my umbrella?

228
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:00,893
Of course, I didn’t bring it,

229
00:22:00,893 --> 00:22:02,854
because that’s not
what I came here for.

230
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:03,813
But don’t worry,

231
00:22:03,813 --> 00:22:05,857
even if I lose it,
I’ll buy you a new one,

232
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:07,316
as many as you want.

233
00:22:08,212 --> 00:22:10,006
Do you really think I can’t
afford to buy an umbrella?

234
00:22:10,403 --> 00:22:11,404
Give it back.

235
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:12,727
That was from Mama.

236
00:22:13,072 --> 00:22:14,280
Don’t worry.

237
00:22:14,436 --> 00:22:15,825
I’ll return it. I’ll drop it off
at your place

238
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:18,327
so you’ll stop sulking like a kid.

239
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,917
Did you say something?

240
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:22,943
Say it again.

241
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:26,921
You’re so rude.
I’m telling your mom.

242
00:22:27,168 --> 00:22:28,169
Wow.

243
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:31,519
So mature, Architect Diaz.

244
00:22:33,175 --> 00:22:36,012
[In Spanish] Whatever.
You’re getting on my nerves.

245
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,092
[In Spanish] Such an asshole.

246
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,678
What are you mumbling about?

247
00:22:41,642 --> 00:22:43,477
You might be putting a curse on me.

248
00:22:45,788 --> 00:22:48,190
Why would I do that, Larkin?

249
00:22:48,357 --> 00:22:50,818
With a face like yours,
the curse has been done.

250
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,579
Wow.

251
00:22:53,484 --> 00:22:54,651
So cocky.

252
00:22:55,163 --> 00:22:56,741
You just went to Spain

253
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:58,546
and now your comebacks
have gotten so good.

254
00:23:09,018 --> 00:23:10,895
Semi middle finger.

255
00:23:29,315 --> 00:23:35,897
♪ I find myself smiling again, ♪

256
00:23:36,891 --> 00:23:41,969
♪ and you are the reason for it. ♪

257
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:47,879
♪ I find myself smiling again. ♪

258
00:23:49,502 --> 00:23:51,896
Wow.

259
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:55,216
So you can sing
while playing now, huh?

260
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:56,217
Of course.

261
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:58,177
Who’s that song for, huh?

262
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,967
For my crush.

263
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,577
A crush?
You have a crush now?

264
00:24:06,602 --> 00:24:10,314
No wonder you’re singing
with so much emotion.

265
00:24:10,391 --> 00:24:11,684
This is their favorite song,

266
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:14,420
and I’m planning to
confess next week.

267
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:16,612
Oh no, don’t confess.

268
00:24:17,071 --> 00:24:18,698
You’ll just ruin your life.

269
00:24:18,781 --> 00:24:21,397
You’re so bitter, Via!

270
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,069
Check this out, Via.

271
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:30,858
Just a second.

272
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,661
Luna!

273
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:37,619
Via! We have a batch
reunion this weekend, okay?

274
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:40,313
We’re going. Just say, yes.

275
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:43,256
I don’t want to
get stressed there.

276
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:45,235
Arkin won’t be there.

277
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,636
He has a shoot, apparently.

278
00:24:46,744 --> 00:24:48,203
Are you sure?

279
00:24:48,228 --> 00:24:49,563
I think so.

280
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:51,825
Let’s just go!

281
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:54,077
You’ll be with me and Ke, anyway.

282
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:56,580
Fine.

283
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,248
Okay, I’ll go.

284
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,166
See you!

285
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,710
- Love you.
- See you.

286
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:06,840
Why aren’t you singing?

287
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,341
- Should I?
- Of course.

288
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,594
- Are you sure?
- Okay.

289
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:18,059
I told you, he’s not coming.

290
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:20,770
Come on, let’s eat.

291
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,188
- Okay.
- You guys, go ahead.

292
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,440
I just need to grab
something for a bit.

293
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,691
- All right.
- Just a moment.

294
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:26,943
Via!

295
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,404
Hey, you look amazing.

296
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,573
You’re sexier now, too!

297
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,783
Thanks. You too,
you look so beautiful.

298
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:36,745
Oh, no big deal, but is it true?

299
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:38,496
You’re an architect
in Spain now?

300
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,224
Yes.

301
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:43,752
Wow. Nice, Architect Diaz.

302
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,909
How have you been?

303
00:25:45,934 --> 00:25:48,812
I’m okay. We’re currently
living in Italy now.

304
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:50,763
You, do you have
a family already?

305
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:55,472
Hi!

306
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:56,723
It’s Larkin!

307
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,391
It’s Larkin!

308
00:25:59,788 --> 00:26:01,331
Hi. Hi, everyone.

309
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,563
Larkin!

310
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:06,524
Long time no see.

311
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,236
Hi, hi.

312
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,029
I’m sorry.

313
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:11,991
Hi!

314
00:26:13,593 --> 00:26:15,636
Good thing you
invited your best friend.

315
00:26:15,897 --> 00:26:19,067
Well, you two were inseparable
back in high school.

316
00:26:19,092 --> 00:26:21,052
I actually thought
you’d end up together.

317
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:22,207
Hi.

318
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:23,458
How are you, guys?

319
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,627
What’s up? I’m good.
How are you?

320
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:29,631
It’s so nice to see
each other again, right?

321
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,385
All right, I’ll go ahead.

322
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:34,844
Hey, how are you?

323
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,975
I’ll just keep quiet.

324
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:39,349
It’s more exhausting to explain why

325
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:40,767
we’re not best
friends anymore,

326
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,397
than to just go along with it.

327
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,188
I don’t really need
to explain to them

328
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:46,898
what happened
between Arkin and me.

329
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:50,235
Most of them already know.
It was all over the news.

330
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,905
Via…

331
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,776
They said he had a shoot today.

332
00:26:58,085 --> 00:26:59,878
No one told me he was coming.

333
00:27:00,263 --> 00:27:01,389
No one.

334
00:27:01,414 --> 00:27:03,541
Don’t be mad, please?
Come on. Let’s sit down.

335
00:27:03,566 --> 00:27:05,109
Sit down.

336
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,211
I’m really sorry, okay?

337
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:10,296
Let’s just eat.

338
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,370
Hi!

339
00:27:19,395 --> 00:27:20,772
Hi, friends!

340
00:27:22,092 --> 00:27:23,093
How are you, guys?

341
00:27:25,091 --> 00:27:26,634
How are you? Have you eaten?

342
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:27,660
Have you eaten?

343
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,316
Yeah.

344
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:58,553
- Shot, shot!
- Shot, shot!

345
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:01,431
- Shot, shot!
- Go, Luna!

346
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:03,391
- Go, girl!
- Go, Luna!

347
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:05,268
My turn!

348
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:07,270
I’ll do it.

349
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:12,150
That’s it!

350
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:17,697
My turn now!

351
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:19,908
Go.

352
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:20,950
Shot!

353
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,121
- Shot, shot!
- Shot, shot!

354
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,753
I’m sorry, did I hurt you?

355
00:28:32,091 --> 00:28:34,301
If it hurts, you can
just quit if you want.

356
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:36,508
I’m sorry.

357
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:40,002
I’m not the type who leaves
easily or gives up,

358
00:28:40,027 --> 00:28:41,320
even when it hurts.

359
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:43,765
Hey!

360
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:45,767
Arkin, what the heck?

361
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:47,310
It was just an accident.

362
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,478
Don’t make a big deal out of it.

363
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:49,479
Come on.

364
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,729
Drink some more.

365
00:28:50,776 --> 00:28:52,028
Don’t you want to drink anymore?

366
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,191
You don’t want to?

367
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:54,776
Oh, no. I do. I can handle it.

368
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:55,985
- You can handle it?
- Yes.

369
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:57,612
- Are you sure?
- Hey!

370
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:59,014
- Yes, excuse me.
- Just wanna make sure.

371
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:02,867
Yes!

372
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:06,955
Wait.

373
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,147
One more?

374
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,291
So strong!

375
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,169
One more!

376
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:18,716
- One more!
- One more!

377
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:44,826
Is it strong?

378
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,411
I don’t think so.

379
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:52,709
Are you drunk now?

380
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:57,797
Am I drunk?

381
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,925
I drank so much because
of someone here

382
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:04,304
and then he asks me,
if I’m drunk?

383
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,560
You’re really annoying.

384
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,021
You are drunk.

385
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:14,898
I’m calling Luna.

386
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:16,063
Luna?

387
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:19,944
Luna already left with
our other batchmates.

388
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:21,070
And Ke…

389
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:23,364
Ke is…

390
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:26,426
Whatever!

391
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:27,660
Get out of here.

392
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,829
I’ll go to Luna and Ke myself.

393
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:32,448
To Luna and Ke.

394
00:30:34,672 --> 00:30:35,965
What are you—

395
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:40,715
I’ll drive you home.

396
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:42,634
I’ll take you home.

397
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:44,802
And I’ll get my umbrella too.

398
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:49,515
I told you, I’m not drunk.

399
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:50,934
Be careful.

400
00:30:51,323 --> 00:30:52,616
Don’t touch me.

401
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,273
I can manage.

402
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:58,608
You can’t.

403
00:30:58,608 --> 00:30:59,609
I can.

404
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,154
- Be careful.
- I’m not drunk.

405
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:05,156
- Careful.
- I’m not drunk. Don’t touch me.

406
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:06,157
Don’t touch me.

407
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:09,744
Ouch!

408
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:12,413
Why didn’t you hold me?

409
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,749
You said not
to touch you, remember?

410
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:17,001
I didn’t say that.
I’m not drunk.

411
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:19,003
Slow down.

412
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:19,712
You’re so annoying.

413
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:21,965
When are you going
to leave me alone?

414
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:27,720
Okay, get in and sit.

415
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:29,806
Slowly.

416
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:33,184
Where are you even taking me?

417
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:34,644
I’m taking you home.

418
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:35,687
Don’t worry.

419
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:47,219
Hello, Ke?

420
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:50,493
Yeah, I’ll take Via home.

421
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:52,620
I’m bringing her home now.

422
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:57,250
I’ll drop her off at her place, okay?

423
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:58,751
I’ve got it covered.

424
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:01,337
All right.
I’ll just update you guys.

425
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:03,881
Okay. Take care.

426
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:49,844
Easy…

427
00:32:49,844 --> 00:32:50,845
I’m gonna go home.

428
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:51,846
All right, here we are.

429
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:53,222
Oh my God.

430
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:54,307
Gonna go home—

431
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:55,516
Easy, easy.

432
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:58,227
- I told you, I’m okay.
- Okay.

433
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:59,645
I’m really not drunk.

434
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:02,648
I can manage. There’s the door.

435
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:04,150
Okay.

436
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:06,258
Easy now.

437
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,212
Where’s the key? Give it to me.

438
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:12,075
I can do it.

439
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:12,909
I’ll do it.

440
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:13,910
This is my house.

441
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:15,203
Wait.

442
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,122
You’re too loud,
you’ll wake them up.

443
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:20,541
- Keep it down.
- You’re the loud one, Via.

444
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:22,600
Oh no.

445
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:25,546
- It doesn’t fit.
- Okay, I’ve got it.

446
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:26,547
I’ll do it.

447
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:28,591
Oh no. Open the door.

448
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:30,927
Open the door. Door, open!

449
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:32,970
You’re too loud. Stop it.

450
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,348
- The door won’t open.
- Let me do it.

451
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:42,605
The door opened.

452
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:43,687
Because of the key.

453
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:45,775
Come on.

454
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:59,664
I told you, I can do it.
Put me down.

455
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:02,003
- I can manage.
- Don’t move around, you might fall again.

456
00:34:02,028 --> 00:34:03,196
- I can manage!
- Careful now.

457
00:34:03,235 --> 00:34:04,653
I can take care of myself.
I already told you.

458
00:34:04,678 --> 00:34:07,180
I can walk.

459
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:39,787
I’m okay now.

460
00:34:41,644 --> 00:34:42,687
I’ll just take a shower.

461
00:34:42,928 --> 00:34:43,929
Can you do it?

462
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:48,362
If not, are you going to give me a bath?

463
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:03,144
I’m fine. You can go now.
Go home.

464
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,187
Thanks.

465
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:05,646
I’ll wait for you.

466
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:08,566
Huh? No, it’s fine. I’m really okay.

467
00:35:09,055 --> 00:35:10,098
I need my umbrella.

468
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,528
You should shower now
because you smell like alcohol.

469
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:17,825
Okay.

470
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:19,744
I’ll be right back.

471
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:23,734
Wait.

472
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,037
What’s the biggest star
doing in my room?

473
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:19,971
You really don’t want to go
home because of your umbrella?

474
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,455
Good night, Kino.

475
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:23,023
Look at how well I cooked this.

476
00:37:23,252 --> 00:37:24,545
You’re so boastful, Arkin.

477
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:25,995
I can do that easily.

478
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:27,288
It’s not that perfect.

479
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:30,249
Look, there’s not even
a little bit of burn anywhere.

480
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:31,417
See?

481
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,210
He hasn’t left yet?

482
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,295
Is it because of the umbrella?

483
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:35,838
- But, Arkin—
- Thank you.

484
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:38,049
Thanks for cooking
breakfast for us.

485
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:44,138
It’s an honor to be cooked
for by a famous actor.

486
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:46,766
So now you’re teasing me, Ysha?

487
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,184
And because of that,
this one’s for you.

488
00:37:49,898 --> 00:37:51,520
Not a stoated—

489
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:53,314
- egg.
- Come on, Arkin.

490
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:55,608
Okay, fine. Toasted. Say it.

491
00:37:55,858 --> 00:37:58,319
- Toasted.
- Toasted.

492
00:37:58,319 --> 00:37:59,445
That’s right.
That’s how it should be.

493
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:00,780
Here you go, your black coffee.

494
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,531
Let me have some.

495
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:04,158
I don’t know why
you drink black coffee,

496
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:05,159
you’re still so young.

497
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,952
He really knows
how to cook now.

498
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:09,330
Feels like just yesterday
he was burning hotdogs.

499
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,456
Here’s your hot chocolate.
That’s your favorite, right?

500
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:11,666
How do you say it?
How do you say it?

501
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,834
Hot chocolate.

502
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,046
He’s still the same as before.

503
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:19,517
He still takes care of my family.

504
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:22,677
Arkin, teach me how to
play the piano next time.

505
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:25,262
I thought you wanted
to learn guitar?

506
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:28,139
Well, I also want to learn piano.

507
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:30,309
All right. Come over
to my house,

508
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:31,811
there’s a piano there,
I’ll teach you. Okay?

509
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:32,953
Sure.

510
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,355
Should I bring Via, too?

511
00:38:41,074 --> 00:38:43,785
Don’t worry, I’m not coming.

512
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:47,493
Wait, I don’t think
I said you could come.

513
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:51,205
I’m just saying. Just in case.

514
00:38:52,162 --> 00:38:54,956
So, you assumed you could come?

515
00:38:55,172 --> 00:38:57,257
I’m just saying. Why?
Am I not allowed?

516
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:02,773
Via, let’s have breakfast.

517
00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:04,182
Arkin, take a seat.

518
00:39:04,207 --> 00:39:05,375
Let’s eat.

519
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,228
No, it’s okay.

520
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:08,097
I need to leave anyway
because I have a shoot.

521
00:39:08,216 --> 00:39:09,217
Huh?

522
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,851
Wait, Arkin. We’ll prepare you
some food to bring.

523
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:14,270
No. It’s okay. There’s food
at the set. It’s fine.

524
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,147
I really just prepared
this for all of you.

525
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,621
- I gotta go now.
- Wow.

526
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,230
Wait, I just need to
grab my cap upstairs.

527
00:39:23,872 --> 00:39:25,165
We’re not getting
back together, okay?

528
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:27,658
We know, Via.

529
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:29,827
You’re being way too defensive.

530
00:39:30,738 --> 00:39:32,073
I’m just making sure it’s clear.

531
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:35,666
Dear sister, it’s as clear as day.

532
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:38,794
Just eat already.

533
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:41,589
All right.
I’ll go ahead now.

534
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:42,298
Finish all the food.

535
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:43,549
You’re supposed
to finish it all. Okay?

536
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:44,508
Yes, Arkin.

537
00:39:44,617 --> 00:39:45,843
- Bye, Arkin.
- Bye.

538
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:46,761
Take care, Arkin.

539
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:48,012
- Bye.
- Bye.

540
00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:49,013
Bye.

541
00:39:49,937 --> 00:39:51,022
Bye to you three.

542
00:39:51,047 --> 00:39:52,215
Hold on!

543
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,523
Wait a second.

544
00:39:56,187 --> 00:39:57,281
Here’s your umbrella.

545
00:39:57,306 --> 00:39:59,308
So you won’t have to
look for it from me anymore.

546
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:01,442
Can I have some?

547
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,682
- Thank you.
- You can keep it.

548
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:06,797
Huh?

549
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:08,115
Then why didn’t he
just leave last night

550
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:09,533
if it weren’t for the umbrella?

551
00:40:09,631 --> 00:40:11,007
Hey! Wait! Your umbrella!

552
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:12,453
Arkin—

553
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:14,960
Your umbrella.

554
00:40:18,724 --> 00:40:19,642
You can keep it.

555
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:21,212
I don’t need it anymore.

556
00:40:21,664 --> 00:40:23,005
Take the umbrella.

557
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:25,466
You might end up looking
for it from me again next time.

558
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,052
I really don’t need it anymore.

559
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,013
Wait.

560
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:33,039
Here.

561
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:59,834
I really can’t bring myself
to get close to you.

562
00:42:01,854 --> 00:42:02,855
Cut!

563
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:04,023
It’s terrible! Damn it!

564
00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:06,295
Arkin, what is happening to you?

565
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:07,443
Oh my gosh!

566
00:42:07,443 --> 00:42:08,569
We’ve been going over
this again and again.

567
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:09,445
Where are you even looking?

568
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:11,084
Do you see something I don’t?

569
00:42:11,822 --> 00:42:13,908
Over and over.
We’re wasting time.

570
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,535
It should be so simple.
What’s happening?

571
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:18,245
The woman is actually
the one leading you.

572
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:19,246
Is this your first time
doing a kissing scene?

573
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:20,331
It’s not, right?

574
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:22,333
Sorry, Director.

575
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:24,351
I’ll just wait for her outside.

576
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:25,210
- All right.
- Excuse me.

577
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,129
We’re wasting time
repeating this scene.

578
00:42:28,064 --> 00:42:29,232
Focus, please.

579
00:42:29,423 --> 00:42:31,508
Last one. Understood?

580
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:32,801
Yes, Director.

581
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:34,803
One more retouch,
then we’ll start.

582
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:38,933
Arkin, you have to imagine
this is the best kiss of your life.

583
00:42:39,065 --> 00:42:40,357
Okay, got it?

584
00:42:42,401 --> 00:42:44,528
Best kiss of my life.

585
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:55,199
Camera? Rolling.

586
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,325
Take eight!

587
00:42:57,034 --> 00:42:58,035
And—

588
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:00,579
Three, two, one—

589
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:01,639
Action!

590
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,456
I can’t get you out of my head.

591
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:07,544
In that case, this will
make it harder for you.

592
00:43:23,686 --> 00:43:25,865
All right. There you go.

593
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:26,939
Beautiful.

594
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,314
And cut!

595
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:31,009
There, perfect! Right? Very good.

596
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,820
If you had done that
earlier, we’d be done by now.

597
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,612
It’s so good.

598
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:34,873
Let’s move on.

599
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:41,453
- Be careful.
- I’m not drunk.

600
00:43:41,795 --> 00:43:43,622
I’m not drunk. Don’t touch me.

601
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:44,723
Don’t touch me.

602
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:46,834
Don’t touch me.

603
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:51,320
I said, don’t touch me.

604
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:52,589
Do not touch me.

605
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:53,841
Okay, then. Fine.

606
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:55,300
Don’t touch me.

607
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:55,884
I won’t touch you?

608
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:57,006
Don’t touch me.

609
00:43:57,221 --> 00:43:58,192
I can manage.

610
00:43:58,762 --> 00:43:59,826
Ouch!

611
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:03,767
Why didn’t you hold me?

612
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:06,228
You said not to touch you,
remember?

613
00:44:06,253 --> 00:44:08,297
I didn’t say that. I’m not drunk.

614
00:44:09,097 --> 00:44:10,974
You’re so annoying.

615
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:12,276
Come on now.

616
00:44:13,009 --> 00:44:14,511
You’re so annoying.

617
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:15,576
Huh?

618
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,138
You again?

619
00:44:19,572 --> 00:44:22,545
Why are you
in front of me again?

620
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:26,040
What are you talking about?

621
00:44:26,373 --> 00:44:28,292
What is it this time?

622
00:44:29,308 --> 00:44:30,559
A standee?

623
00:44:30,945 --> 00:44:32,155
Poster?

624
00:44:33,156 --> 00:44:34,157
Billboard?

625
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,467
Why are you
all over the place?

626
00:44:38,177 --> 00:44:40,179
Because of that face of yours.

627
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:42,823
That face.

628
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,475
This. This one. This face.

629
00:44:44,475 --> 00:44:46,852
Your face is plastered
all over the whole country.

630
00:44:47,186 --> 00:44:48,103
Everywhere.

631
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:53,442
On TV, on the radio,
in cinemas, on billboards.

632
00:44:54,232 --> 00:44:56,295
Your face is everywhere.

633
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,287
When are you going
to leave me alone, huh?

634
00:45:01,158 --> 00:45:03,787
I always see your face.

635
00:45:06,205 --> 00:45:07,206
You’re drunk.

636
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,119
I’m not drunk!

637
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:11,960
- Come on.
- I’m not drunk.

638
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,961
Get inside.

639
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:14,254
Why?

640
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:18,857
I’m taking you home.

641
00:45:31,453 --> 00:45:32,454
Hello, Ke?

642
00:45:33,816 --> 00:45:35,443
Yeah, I’ll take Via home.

643
00:45:36,215 --> 00:45:37,633
I’m bringing her home now.

644
00:45:39,379 --> 00:45:42,299
I’ll drop her off at her place, okay?

645
00:45:42,495 --> 00:45:43,663
I’ve got it covered.

646
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:46,370
All right.
I’ll just update you guys.

647
00:45:47,302 --> 00:45:49,179
Okay. Take care.

648
00:46:45,262 --> 00:46:46,263
Via?

649
00:46:46,263 --> 00:46:47,389
Dan!

650
00:46:47,568 --> 00:46:48,986
You’re here too?

651
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:50,118
May I?

652
00:46:50,143 --> 00:46:51,144
Yeah, of course.

653
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:52,560
How are you?

654
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,897
I just transferred today.

655
00:46:54,897 --> 00:46:56,106
Looks like we’re
co-workers now.

656
00:46:56,106 --> 00:46:58,400
Looking forward to working
with you, Architect Diaz.

657
00:46:58,594 --> 00:47:00,552
Same here, Architect Morales.

658
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:05,616
Hey, come with us
on the beach trip.

659
00:47:05,616 --> 00:47:06,575
You know, it’s been so long

660
00:47:06,575 --> 00:47:07,576
since you’ve hung out with us.

661
00:47:07,576 --> 00:47:08,577
I was even thinking,

662
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:11,705
he doesn’t want to be
friends with us anymore.

663
00:47:11,705 --> 00:47:14,349
Via might feel awkward.
You know we’re not okay.

664
00:47:15,626 --> 00:47:18,962
All right, bye.
Take care, okay? Bye!

665
00:47:29,723 --> 00:47:31,475
You’re really smiling at
whoever you’re talking to there,

666
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:33,101
Architect Diaz.

667
00:47:33,264 --> 00:47:34,998
You probably have
a boyfriend now.

668
00:47:35,345 --> 00:47:36,346
Huh?

669
00:47:36,857 --> 00:47:37,998
A boyfriend?

670
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:39,779
No, I don’t.

671
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:42,194
Via, by the way, your vitamins.

672
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:44,920
You looked so pale
at the office earlier.
