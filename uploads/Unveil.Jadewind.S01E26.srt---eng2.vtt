{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:34.945
CULTIVATION AND CAUTION

00:01:35.025 --> 00:01:35.945
Peiyi.

00:01:37.705 --> 00:01:39.465
Just know how I feel,

00:01:39.545 --> 00:01:41.465
but don't let it weigh on you.

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:44.385
And I

00:01:45.185 --> 00:01:48.425
won't look back on the choice I've made.

00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:00.785
What is that?

00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:04.025
Airglow. It's extremely rare.

00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:05.385
I checked the almanac.

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:08.225
A crimson light stretches

00:02:08.945 --> 00:02:10.385
from the Hua constellation to the Ji.

00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:17.225
It was the celestial sign
on the day of your birth.

00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:20.825
Thank you.

00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:23.745
You answered every question I had.

00:02:44.545 --> 00:02:45.905
CHAI'S BLACKSMITH

00:02:45.985 --> 00:02:47.145
You picked a good spot.

00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:49.785
Even if someone tries to eavesdrop,
they can't hear much.

00:02:50.505 --> 00:02:52.065
The blacksmith is a reliable man.

00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:53.865
Your Ladyship can rest assured.

00:02:56.985 --> 00:02:58.105
I've checked

00:02:58.185 --> 00:03:00.345
every clinic and pharmacy on the street

00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:02.145
and in the Ghost Market.

00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:04.945
Indeed, someone is looking
for eye medicine.

00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:06.345
PRESCRIPTION

00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:09.065
Apiaceae root and licorice
neutralize toxins.

00:03:09.585 --> 00:03:12.345
Honeysuckle and cassia seeds
improve eyesight.

00:03:13.105 --> 00:03:14.545
All these various prescriptions

00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:16.385
contain four crucial ingredients.

00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:20.985
I'd say these patient names

00:03:21.585 --> 00:03:24.065
are either fabricated
or planted there as a cover-up.

00:03:24.145 --> 00:03:26.985
You're right. I looked into them.

00:03:27.065 --> 00:03:29.505
These people do exist.

00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:31.625
But they never used those medicines.

00:03:31.705 --> 00:03:34.865
But as for who actually used the medicine,

00:03:34.945 --> 00:03:36.905
that trail has truly gone cold.

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:40.305
That's expected.

00:03:41.265 --> 00:03:44.185
His eye is stained with the toxic blood
spat out by the old man.

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:46.065
He's having a hard time.

00:03:47.905 --> 00:03:50.185
An eye injury is quite special.

00:03:50.265 --> 00:03:51.865
It's too obvious.

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:54.465
No wonder he is so low-key and cautious.

00:03:55.185 --> 00:03:56.705
He's been poisoned for over a month.

00:03:57.945 --> 00:03:59.785
The old man's poison

00:04:00.345 --> 00:04:02.265
will make him suffer.

00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:05.145
It won't kill him,
but it'll leave him in misery.

00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:07.465
What poison did Inspector Du use?

00:04:08.505 --> 00:04:09.665
He had too many types of poison.

00:04:09.745 --> 00:04:10.705
I'm not sure.

00:04:11.305 --> 00:04:13.825
We can only try to deduce
based on the prescriptions.

00:04:16.265 --> 00:04:18.705
The old man
probably recognized that person.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:20.705
Really?

00:04:20.785 --> 00:04:22.265
Did he leave any clues?

00:04:23.585 --> 00:04:25.625
He exchanged a few moves with him.

00:04:25.705 --> 00:04:27.305
Judging from his reaction,

00:04:27.385 --> 00:04:28.905
he was no stranger to that man.

00:04:28.985 --> 00:04:31.945
That man realized it and killed him.

00:04:32.025 --> 00:04:33.465
Perhaps,

00:04:35.105 --> 00:04:36.505
he also works for the court.

00:04:36.585 --> 00:04:38.385
Maybe of high status, too.

00:04:40.465 --> 00:04:43.305
If he really works for the court,
it's easy to find him.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.145
Check them one by one.

00:04:45.225 --> 00:04:48.465
We will surely find
that one-eyed man, or his corpse.

00:04:49.665 --> 00:04:51.825
They had the nerve to kill Inspector Du.

00:04:51.905 --> 00:04:54.385
Your Ladyship, be careful.

00:04:55.905 --> 00:04:57.545
It's not that easy to kill me.

00:04:57.625 --> 00:04:59.025
But you…

00:04:59.105 --> 00:05:00.585
You must stay safe.

00:05:02.305 --> 00:05:03.665
What should we do next?

00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:06.065
PRESCRIPTION

00:05:08.185 --> 00:05:10.345
Is this meant to cure the eyes
or to detoxify?

00:05:11.505 --> 00:05:14.265
When it comes to eye treatment,

00:05:14.345 --> 00:05:15.745
Physician Liu is the best.

00:05:15.825 --> 00:05:17.225
But regarding detoxification,

00:05:17.305 --> 00:05:18.825
I'm the one you need.

00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:21.745
Keep an eye out for someone
with a poisoned left eye.

00:05:22.585 --> 00:05:24.705
- A court official?
- That's right.

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:26.865
This is strange.

00:05:26.945 --> 00:05:29.105
Why wouldn't a court official
come to me for that?

00:05:30.665 --> 00:05:31.985
This person is cautious.

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:33.425
I don't think he's come here.

00:05:34.105 --> 00:05:35.305
It's been more than a month.

00:05:35.385 --> 00:05:38.465
He's been seeking medicine
under someone else's identity

00:05:38.545 --> 00:05:39.385
but to no avail.

00:05:39.465 --> 00:05:42.865
Even if he seeks your help,
he won't come in person.

00:05:42.945 --> 00:05:44.785
Nor will he mention
anything about his eyes.

00:05:46.265 --> 00:05:48.025
- A perpetrator?
- An enemy.

00:05:50.985 --> 00:05:53.265
What kind of poison are we talking about?

00:05:54.745 --> 00:05:57.025
I'm not sure. But it develops quickly,

00:05:57.105 --> 00:05:58.625
causing numbness in the limbs,

00:05:58.705 --> 00:06:00.425
difficulty breathing, and vomiting blood.

00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:04.625
The Apiaceae root and licorice are meant

00:06:04.705 --> 00:06:06.825
to neutralize the poisonous star anise.

00:06:06.905 --> 00:06:09.265
The vomiting of blood
is likely caused by other toxins.

00:06:09.345 --> 00:06:11.585
Give me some time. I'll figure it out.

00:06:12.465 --> 00:06:13.385
Thanks in advance.

00:06:21.945 --> 00:06:24.225
I thought my wooden figure
was one of a kind.

00:06:24.305 --> 00:06:25.305
You made so many.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:26.545
Trying to please someone else?

00:06:27.745 --> 00:06:28.825
These ordinary figures

00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:30.945
are not comparable
to the customized one for you.

00:06:35.505 --> 00:06:36.745
They do look rougher.

00:06:37.345 --> 00:06:39.905
If you know what I'm doing,
you wouldn't blame me.

00:06:42.305 --> 00:06:44.705
We have some new female apprentices.

00:06:44.785 --> 00:06:46.985
Physician Liu said
that I made great figures and told me

00:06:47.065 --> 00:06:48.105
to tutor the apprentices.

00:06:48.185 --> 00:06:50.545
These wooden figures
are tools for teaching.

00:06:51.985 --> 00:06:53.625
Congratulations on becoming a mentor.

00:06:56.265 --> 00:06:59.065
ASTRONOMICAL BUREAU

00:07:24.265 --> 00:07:25.505
You followed me all the way.

00:07:25.585 --> 00:07:27.025
What can I do for you?

00:07:29.225 --> 00:07:30.265
Come with me.

00:07:30.905 --> 00:07:32.025
May I ask who you are?

00:07:32.705 --> 00:07:34.025
You're about to die.

00:07:34.105 --> 00:07:35.945
Why bother asking?

00:07:37.425 --> 00:07:40.465
Naturally, I need to know my killer

00:07:40.545 --> 00:07:43.265
to seek justice in the afterworld.

00:07:45.145 --> 00:07:47.025
The mortal world has no justice.

00:07:47.105 --> 00:07:48.865
Why would the afterworld be any different?

00:07:51.345 --> 00:07:53.025
I know you don't know martial arts.

00:07:53.705 --> 00:07:56.225
Come with me. Don't try anything smart.

00:07:58.185 --> 00:07:59.825
It's not that easy to take me with you.

00:08:01.025 --> 00:08:02.625
- I have reinforcements.
- Mr. Xiao.

00:08:08.465 --> 00:08:09.425
She's not as fast as I am.

00:08:10.225 --> 00:08:11.345
You can't be faster than this.

00:08:36.505 --> 00:08:37.465
Peiyi.

00:08:39.305 --> 00:08:40.345
Are you alright?

00:08:42.185 --> 00:08:44.505
- I'm hurt.
- Where?

00:08:48.745 --> 00:08:51.265
- He hasn't gone far yet.
- It's pouring.

00:08:51.345 --> 00:08:52.185
Don't go after him.

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:53.505
But he tried to kill you.

00:08:53.585 --> 00:08:55.065
He wasn't trying to kill me.

00:08:56.705 --> 00:08:58.065
He was forcing me to leave with him.

00:08:58.145 --> 00:09:00.385
I'm sure he'll come back.

00:09:00.465 --> 00:09:01.825
We can catch him next time.

00:09:03.225 --> 00:09:04.825
It's getting chilly. Don't catch a cold.

00:09:07.305 --> 00:09:09.105
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:09:09.185 --> 00:09:10.585
What does that man look like?

00:09:11.185 --> 00:09:13.465
He is of medium build
and wears a bamboo hat

00:09:13.545 --> 00:09:14.665
to conceal his face.

00:09:14.745 --> 00:09:16.945
I saw his eyes.

00:09:17.025 --> 00:09:19.025
Thick eyebrows and small eyes
with a scar at the corner.

00:09:19.105 --> 00:09:22.545
His fingers are black, rough, and chapped,

00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:23.545
with protruding joints.

00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:25.305
But I don't think he's a hitman.

00:09:25.385 --> 00:09:27.425
Those are the hands of a heavy laborer.

00:09:28.105 --> 00:09:30.625
His blade is basic,
not made of good steel.

00:09:30.705 --> 00:09:31.745
There is rust on the handle.

00:09:31.825 --> 00:09:33.065
He doesn't use it often.

00:09:33.145 --> 00:09:34.345
But it's possible

00:09:34.425 --> 00:09:37.225
that he found an old blade
to cover up his identity.

00:09:38.105 --> 00:09:38.945
Mr. Xiao.

00:09:39.025 --> 00:09:40.505
Have you offended anyone recently?

00:09:40.585 --> 00:09:42.825
I am on good terms with my colleagues.

00:09:42.905 --> 00:09:44.505
No conflicting patterns in the stars.

00:09:45.025 --> 00:09:47.145
Even if I've unknowingly offended someone,

00:09:47.225 --> 00:09:49.905
it shouldn't be enough
to make them want me dead.

00:09:51.225 --> 00:09:53.705
Could he be Silver Mask's subordinate?

00:09:54.505 --> 00:09:56.665
He knows martial arts,
but he's only average,

00:09:56.745 --> 00:09:58.065
definitely no match for Your Ladyship.

00:09:58.145 --> 00:09:59.985
Silver Mask's subordinates

00:10:00.065 --> 00:10:02.105
were ruthless, nothing like him.

00:10:03.825 --> 00:10:06.305
Even though I'm better than him,

00:10:06.385 --> 00:10:07.665
I could tell

00:10:07.745 --> 00:10:10.545
that he wasn't going all out
during the fight.

00:10:10.625 --> 00:10:12.585
He just kept blocking, trying to get away.

00:10:14.865 --> 00:10:17.985
Who in the world
would come after Mr. Xiao?

00:10:23.105 --> 00:10:24.625
We need more clues.

00:10:24.705 --> 00:10:27.425
That man didn't even confirm my identity.

00:10:27.505 --> 00:10:28.465
He wasn't necessarily after me.

00:10:29.265 --> 00:10:31.145
Let's not jump to conclusions.

00:10:35.185 --> 00:10:36.225
Perhaps,

00:10:36.305 --> 00:10:39.105
he saw Your Ladyship
and realized that he was mistaken.

00:10:39.185 --> 00:10:40.265
Then we don't have to worry.

00:10:41.065 --> 00:10:43.065
He lay in ambush
outside the Astronomical Bureau

00:10:43.145 --> 00:10:44.625
to get Mr. Xiao for sure.

00:10:44.705 --> 00:10:46.545
So if he comes again,

00:10:46.625 --> 00:10:48.025
he will leave a trace.

00:10:49.545 --> 00:10:51.065
With Your Ladyship's skills,

00:10:51.585 --> 00:10:53.185
even if you can't capture him,

00:10:53.265 --> 00:10:54.865
you'll find out who he is.

00:10:56.025 --> 00:10:57.505
Mr. Xiao is right.

00:10:57.585 --> 00:11:00.305
I'll find someone to complete a portrait
of the perpetrator.

00:11:00.385 --> 00:11:01.865
Let me…

00:11:01.945 --> 00:11:03.305
It's getting late.

00:11:04.025 --> 00:11:05.625
You have work to do tomorrow.

00:11:05.705 --> 00:11:07.825
I won't trouble you
with such a trivial matter.

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:09.425
Alright.

00:11:09.505 --> 00:11:11.385
I'll leave it to you. I take my leave.

00:11:23.745 --> 00:11:26.665
Don't go home these days. Just stay here.

00:11:27.905 --> 00:11:29.465
He won't come back tonight.

00:11:32.585 --> 00:11:33.425
How do you know?

00:11:34.145 --> 00:11:35.625
If you're so good at fortune-telling,

00:11:35.705 --> 00:11:37.985
why didn't you foresee
the assassin coming after you?

00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:41.865
But I knew you'd come to my rescue.

00:11:43.025 --> 00:11:44.025
Still playing tough, huh?

00:11:46.625 --> 00:11:48.065
I have my master's compass for protection.

00:11:48.145 --> 00:11:49.825
Even if you didn't show up,

00:11:49.905 --> 00:11:51.305
I could have saved myself.

00:11:56.545 --> 00:11:57.385
Peiyi.

00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:00.945
Do you realize

00:12:01.465 --> 00:12:03.665
that if your timing was even a bit off,

00:12:03.745 --> 00:12:05.585
I would have to collect your corpse?

00:12:11.505 --> 00:12:12.585
It's dangerous at night.

00:12:13.105 --> 00:12:13.985
Please

00:12:14.585 --> 00:12:16.545
take me in for the night.

00:12:28.465 --> 00:12:29.305
Go to rest.

00:12:35.305 --> 00:12:36.145
Are you mad?

00:12:45.305 --> 00:12:46.945
I was careless earlier.

00:12:47.025 --> 00:12:49.305
But you've been investigating Silver Mask

00:12:49.385 --> 00:12:50.385
and need clues.

00:12:50.465 --> 00:12:53.225
If I can lure him out as bait,

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:55.305
perhaps we can turn the tide.

00:12:59.065 --> 00:13:00.545
I can hide here for a while,

00:13:01.065 --> 00:13:02.785
but not forever.

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.585
Even if we don't care about the gossip,

00:13:06.225 --> 00:13:08.185
I don't want to give people
more to talk about.

00:13:13.945 --> 00:13:14.825
Fine.

00:13:15.345 --> 00:13:17.145
Since you insist on being the bait,

00:13:17.225 --> 00:13:18.385
go back at dawn.

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:21.065
You and Mr. Gu will protect me, right?

00:13:22.465 --> 00:13:24.145
We won't let you die so easily.

00:13:27.585 --> 00:13:28.745
Peiyi.

00:13:29.265 --> 00:13:32.105
Why did you go
to the Astronomical Bureau tonight?

00:13:34.505 --> 00:13:35.465
I brought you

00:13:36.305 --> 00:13:37.305
an umbrella.

00:13:54.505 --> 00:13:57.585
{\an8}Centipede. Cinnabar. Illicium anisatum.

00:13:58.585 --> 00:13:59.785
Physician Zhao.

00:13:59.865 --> 00:14:01.825
I asked you for a prescription.

00:14:01.905 --> 00:14:04.305
But you wrote me a deadly poison?

00:14:05.545 --> 00:14:07.225
This may look deadly, Your Ladyship.

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:08.465
But the truth is,

00:14:08.545 --> 00:14:10.945
with a perfectly controlled dosage,

00:14:11.025 --> 00:14:13.625
these toxins can work together

00:14:13.705 --> 00:14:14.745
as an antidote.

00:14:16.145 --> 00:14:18.265
I just don't want it to be too effective.

00:14:18.345 --> 00:14:20.265
If that man gets detoxified with one dose,

00:14:20.345 --> 00:14:21.625
how can I use it as bait?

00:14:23.465 --> 00:14:24.585
That's easy.

00:14:24.665 --> 00:14:26.065
Halve the dosage

00:14:26.145 --> 00:14:28.185
and add an extra dose of purslane.

00:14:28.265 --> 00:14:30.825
The first dose can already take effect.

00:14:30.905 --> 00:14:33.225
But the purslane can cause itchy skin.

00:14:33.305 --> 00:14:36.305
He will need me
to apply acupuncture to go on.

00:14:36.385 --> 00:14:39.025
Then I can catch the big fish

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:41.385
and bring him to Your Ladyship.

00:14:45.265 --> 00:14:46.105
Give me a second.

00:14:54.425 --> 00:14:55.625
This is for you.

00:15:00.105 --> 00:15:01.305
What is this?

00:15:02.945 --> 00:15:04.265
Apply it under your eyes.

00:15:04.345 --> 00:15:06.065
Scrub it off after a ke.

00:15:06.145 --> 00:15:07.625
It will remove your dark circles

00:15:07.705 --> 00:15:10.305
so no one can tell
that you didn't sleep well.

00:15:10.945 --> 00:15:14.225
I just developed this paste
for the ladies in the palace.

00:15:14.305 --> 00:15:15.825
I haven't even named it yet.

00:15:17.665 --> 00:15:19.065
Don't mind its look.

00:15:19.145 --> 00:15:20.305
Fight poison with poison.

00:15:20.385 --> 00:15:21.825
- Fight dark circles with dark paste.
- Fight dark circles with dark paste.

00:15:25.585 --> 00:15:29.145
EASTERN CAPITAL AGARWOOD

00:15:30.865 --> 00:15:33.065
Just do what I say
and give out the medicine,

00:15:33.145 --> 00:15:35.185
but do not disclose the prescription.

00:15:39.225 --> 00:15:41.545
I understand, Your Ladyship.

00:15:42.385 --> 00:15:43.585
I owe him big time.

00:15:43.665 --> 00:15:46.545
This is all I can do for him.

00:15:46.625 --> 00:15:48.385
Be very careful.

00:15:49.025 --> 00:15:51.665
This time, I will do you justice.

00:15:51.745 --> 00:15:53.545
Thank you for your concern.

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:08.385
You even know about traps?

00:16:08.905 --> 00:16:11.865
I read Mojing when I was a child
and tried many tricks on the old man.

00:16:12.465 --> 00:16:14.305
I have all these mechanics ready.

00:16:15.145 --> 00:16:17.225
Set them up before you leave.

00:16:17.305 --> 00:16:19.385
If anything looks moved
when you come back,

00:16:19.465 --> 00:16:20.305
just don't come in.

00:16:21.545 --> 00:16:23.505
{\an8}ENTRANCE

00:16:38.145 --> 00:16:38.985
With so many traps,

00:16:39.065 --> 00:16:41.705
I'll be caught before that assassin.

00:16:43.025 --> 00:16:44.545
You have a great memory.

00:16:45.305 --> 00:16:46.785
I'm sure you can avoid the traps.

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:48.665
Just be the bait.

00:16:48.745 --> 00:16:50.385
Leave the rest to Prosecutor Gu and me.

00:16:54.385 --> 00:16:57.105
It seems that you are worried
I might get hurt.

00:16:58.945 --> 00:17:00.985
Not at all. I drew it for fun.

00:17:05.385 --> 00:17:08.944
You've mapped my residence
in such minute detail

00:17:09.025 --> 00:17:10.745
that I have no secrets left before you.

00:17:11.545 --> 00:17:13.464
What you are willing to reveal

00:17:13.545 --> 00:17:14.424
is not exactly a secret.

00:17:16.385 --> 00:17:18.745
I'll be counting on you, Mr. Gu.

00:17:18.825 --> 00:17:20.184
Mr. Xiao is putting himself at risk.

00:17:20.265 --> 00:17:22.065
We can't make a single mistake.

00:17:22.145 --> 00:17:22.985
Rest assured.

00:17:23.704 --> 00:17:24.985
If that man dares to come again,

00:17:25.065 --> 00:17:27.505
I will bring him to you for interrogation.

00:17:28.265 --> 00:17:30.385
You don't necessarily
have to capture him alive.

00:17:31.025 --> 00:17:31.865
Understood.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:34.345
Your Ladyship. I'll check around again.

00:17:40.425 --> 00:17:42.465
I know you don't like blades and swords.

00:17:42.545 --> 00:17:44.505
I found someone to make this for you.

00:17:45.305 --> 00:17:46.145
You can pull the trigger

00:17:46.825 --> 00:17:48.825
without much effort to shoot.

00:17:54.465 --> 00:17:56.465
Don't find me paranoid.

00:17:57.345 --> 00:17:58.385
Why would I?

00:18:00.145 --> 00:18:02.025
If Mr. Gu should overlook something,

00:18:03.065 --> 00:18:04.185
I'll be counting on this.

00:18:06.145 --> 00:18:08.665
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:18:12.225 --> 00:18:13.145
Your Ladyship.

00:18:16.065 --> 00:18:18.345
Someone contacted Jin Niang
about the medicine.

00:18:18.425 --> 00:18:20.305
You already found him?

00:18:20.385 --> 00:18:21.225
Where are we meeting?

00:18:21.305 --> 00:18:22.945
He asked to meet tomorrow,

00:18:23.025 --> 00:18:24.705
but the exact time and location

00:18:24.785 --> 00:18:26.705
won't be revealed
until an hour before the meeting.

00:18:28.305 --> 00:18:29.785
So cautious.

00:18:29.865 --> 00:18:31.305
It's probably Silver Mask.

00:18:31.385 --> 00:18:33.545
Your Ladyship.
Let me take Physician Zhao's place.

00:18:33.625 --> 00:18:35.865
If anything happens, I can handle it.

00:18:35.945 --> 00:18:37.065
Absolutely not.

00:18:37.145 --> 00:18:38.865
Acupuncture isn't child's play.

00:18:38.945 --> 00:18:40.865
If you kill someone,
you'll ruin my reputation.

00:18:41.505 --> 00:18:43.385
I'm worried about your life,

00:18:43.905 --> 00:18:45.585
but you're worried about your reputation?

00:18:46.465 --> 00:18:47.385
I…

00:18:47.905 --> 00:18:49.545
I'm also worried about you.

00:18:49.625 --> 00:18:51.145
He is so cautious.

00:18:51.225 --> 00:18:53.065
If he finds out you're an imposter,

00:18:53.145 --> 00:18:54.505
you'd give us away at once.

00:18:54.585 --> 00:18:56.025
I know acupoints.

00:18:56.105 --> 00:18:58.185
Just teach me how to apply acupuncture.

00:18:59.585 --> 00:19:00.865
You underestimate our job.

00:19:01.465 --> 00:19:02.985
Applying acupuncture to save lives

00:19:03.065 --> 00:19:04.625
is not easier
than practicing martial arts.

00:19:04.705 --> 00:19:06.905
You can't do it without practicing
for three or five years.

00:19:08.305 --> 00:19:09.665
This person is so cautious.

00:19:09.745 --> 00:19:11.785
He will certainly try to test us.

00:19:11.865 --> 00:19:13.225
We must be convincing

00:19:13.305 --> 00:19:14.665
so that he lets his guard down.

00:19:14.745 --> 00:19:16.265
That's how we succeed.

00:19:17.545 --> 00:19:19.665
At least let me be
an Apprentice Pharmacist

00:19:19.745 --> 00:19:21.785
and go with Physician Zhao.

00:19:22.305 --> 00:19:25.385
I fear we'll risk her safety
without even learning his identity.

00:19:25.465 --> 00:19:26.465
It's not worth it.

00:19:26.545 --> 00:19:27.785
It's difficult.

00:19:29.065 --> 00:19:31.465
He may only meet Physician Zhao alone.

00:19:32.265 --> 00:19:33.665
Wuren does have a point.

00:19:34.385 --> 00:19:35.425
That man is cruel.

00:19:35.505 --> 00:19:37.025
Don't take it lightly.

00:19:37.105 --> 00:19:39.945
We'll be around to protect Physician Zhao.

00:19:40.025 --> 00:19:42.025
He has a scar
on the back of his right hand.

00:19:42.745 --> 00:19:43.945
It's just a test this time.

00:19:44.025 --> 00:19:45.625
Just remember his appearance

00:19:45.705 --> 00:19:47.505
and characteristics this time.

00:19:48.105 --> 00:19:49.505
Don't reveal your identity.

00:19:49.585 --> 00:19:50.985
Get out as soon as possible.

00:19:51.065 --> 00:19:52.545
Don't make any extra moves.

00:19:53.865 --> 00:19:55.865
Rest assured. He can't wear his mask

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:57.505
with that eye injury.

00:19:57.585 --> 00:19:58.905
I will take a good look at him.

00:20:02.705 --> 00:20:03.545
Your Ladyship.

00:20:03.625 --> 00:20:05.265
Do you have

00:20:05.345 --> 00:20:06.745
any protective gear,

00:20:07.505 --> 00:20:09.745
like soft armor for self-defense?

00:20:09.825 --> 00:20:12.105
I'm a bit nervous.

00:20:15.105 --> 00:20:16.425
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:20:17.665 --> 00:20:18.665
Peiyi.

00:20:21.345 --> 00:20:24.025
He will suspect that you're luring
him out with the antidote.

00:20:24.105 --> 00:20:26.665
So someone will be watching you tomorrow.

00:20:26.745 --> 00:20:28.145
I know what to do.

00:20:28.745 --> 00:20:30.625
I won't use anyone from the bureau.

00:20:30.705 --> 00:20:32.865
Only Wuren and Mr. Gu
will go in plain clothes.

00:20:32.945 --> 00:20:35.265
I'll meet them once I lose the tail.

00:20:35.345 --> 00:20:38.745
So stay here tomorrow before we return.

00:20:38.825 --> 00:20:39.825
Don't go home alone.

00:20:41.065 --> 00:20:41.985
I'll go with you.

00:20:43.225 --> 00:20:45.025
That will only distract me.

00:20:45.105 --> 00:20:46.505
I'm just trying to reassure you.

00:20:47.025 --> 00:20:48.585
I'll stay put nearby.

00:21:00.145 --> 00:21:00.985
The wind is rising.

00:21:04.705 --> 00:21:05.785
Your Ladyship, come with me.

00:21:18.345 --> 00:21:20.865
It's a wind-sensing bird
with a flower in its beak.

00:21:20.945 --> 00:21:22.625
The spinning flower shows you the wind.

00:21:22.705 --> 00:21:23.945
Winter is coming.

00:21:24.025 --> 00:21:26.705
Watch the bird to know
if it's getting cold,

00:21:26.785 --> 00:21:28.025
so you can dress warmer.

00:21:28.625 --> 00:21:29.425
You gave me a crossbow.

00:21:29.505 --> 00:21:31.065
Naturally, I have to reciprocate.

00:21:32.705 --> 00:21:34.545
I appreciate your kindness, then.

00:21:51.025 --> 00:21:52.145
- Come on in.
- Sir, welcome.

00:21:52.225 --> 00:21:53.065
YUNCHUI HOUSE

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:54.185
Table for how many?

00:21:55.105 --> 00:21:56.665
‪-Sure thing.
‪-Be careful.

00:21:56.745 --> 00:21:59.905
- Coming right up.
- Come on in, Sir.

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:00.905
‪Sure.

00:22:35.545 --> 00:22:38.145
GET OUT NOW AND GO EAST
SOMEONE WILL MEET YOU

00:23:05.705 --> 00:23:06.625
Don't move.

00:23:07.385 --> 00:23:08.945
He changed the meeting place

00:23:09.025 --> 00:23:11.065
to see if someone
was following Physician Zhao.

00:23:25.585 --> 00:23:27.945
YUNCHUI HOUSE

00:23:40.705 --> 00:23:42.305
Her Ladyship asked me

00:23:42.385 --> 00:23:44.305
to prepare the maps of this entire area.

00:23:44.385 --> 00:23:46.185
Except for a few big mansions in the east,

00:23:46.265 --> 00:23:47.745
there are many restaurants and taverns.

00:23:47.825 --> 00:23:49.025
He is too cautious

00:23:49.105 --> 00:23:50.785
to meet Physician Zhao at home just yet.

00:23:51.385 --> 00:23:52.465
Restaurants and taverns

00:23:52.985 --> 00:23:53.825
aren't private.

00:23:53.905 --> 00:23:56.065
Further east is the Jueshui River.

00:23:56.145 --> 00:23:58.065
There are plenty of small boats.

00:23:58.145 --> 00:24:00.665
It might be private,
but it's impossible for acupuncture.

00:24:00.745 --> 00:24:02.185
They wouldn't meet there.

00:24:03.065 --> 00:24:03.985
Where can they go?

00:24:04.585 --> 00:24:05.745
They can leave by boat.

00:24:06.265 --> 00:24:07.425
All those boats look similar.

00:24:07.505 --> 00:24:09.825
We can't easily tell them apart.

00:24:10.345 --> 00:24:11.345
Here.

00:24:12.465 --> 00:24:13.425
Storeroom.

00:24:14.625 --> 00:24:15.945
Come with me.

00:24:24.385 --> 00:24:26.545
SHUANGHUAN PORT

00:24:50.145 --> 00:24:52.745
I can't speak of my difficulties here,
and I apologize

00:24:53.505 --> 00:24:54.425
for offending you.

00:24:55.865 --> 00:24:57.585
If your reward wasn't so generous,

00:24:57.665 --> 00:24:58.745
I'd slap you first.

00:24:59.545 --> 00:25:00.785
You are really bold.

00:25:01.825 --> 00:25:02.985
Aren't you scared of getting killed?

00:25:06.185 --> 00:25:07.545
You're waiting for my help.

00:25:07.625 --> 00:25:08.545
You won't kill me.

00:25:09.225 --> 00:25:10.065
Take a seat.

00:25:29.185 --> 00:25:30.425
What are you doing?

00:25:32.105 --> 00:25:33.585
How do I apply acupuncture
with that mask on?

00:26:19.265 --> 00:26:21.785
I saw her going to the pier
near Yunchui House and boarded a boat.

00:26:21.865 --> 00:26:23.745
I followed her along the riverbank.

00:26:23.825 --> 00:26:25.145
Mr. Xiao is right again.

00:26:26.705 --> 00:26:29.265
This storeroom is in a secluded spot.
Few people pass by.

00:26:29.345 --> 00:26:31.585
Next to the Jueshui River
with alleys all around,

00:26:31.665 --> 00:26:34.185
it's surely a nice spot,
flexible and safe.

00:26:34.905 --> 00:26:35.745
But Physician Zhao

00:26:35.825 --> 00:26:37.785
probably didn't enter by herself.

00:26:37.865 --> 00:26:40.545
After Yudi boarded,
several small boats set out at once.

00:26:40.625 --> 00:26:41.985
I saw them carrying

00:26:42.065 --> 00:26:44.545
over a dozen wooden crates
from the boats into the storeroom.

00:26:44.625 --> 00:26:45.465
I didn't see her.

00:26:45.545 --> 00:26:46.545
How long has it been?

00:26:47.425 --> 00:26:48.265
Less than a ke.

00:26:56.385 --> 00:26:58.185
Both of you, stay alert.

00:26:58.785 --> 00:27:00.865
These people all look wary,

00:27:00.945 --> 00:27:02.905
probably not the storeroom guards.

00:27:03.705 --> 00:27:05.385
There is only one exit.

00:27:05.905 --> 00:27:07.185
Yudi should still be in there.

00:27:08.625 --> 00:27:09.665
Just wait.

00:27:09.745 --> 00:27:11.745
If she doesn't come out in a while,

00:27:11.825 --> 00:27:13.025
let's go in to save her.

00:27:20.905 --> 00:27:22.025
What's your name?

00:27:24.225 --> 00:27:25.065
Zhao Sanniang.

00:27:25.665 --> 00:27:28.625
Why haven't I heard of you
in the Western Capital

00:27:28.705 --> 00:27:30.785
if you are so proficient
in medical skills?

00:27:31.665 --> 00:27:33.025
I just came this month.

00:27:33.105 --> 00:27:34.585
Who told you to make the antidote?

00:27:34.665 --> 00:27:36.145
This is a rare poison.

00:27:36.225 --> 00:27:37.785
How do you know about it?

00:27:37.865 --> 00:27:39.625
The pharmacy people nearby said

00:27:39.705 --> 00:27:41.345
someone was offering
a fortune for an antidote.

00:27:42.225 --> 00:27:43.585
It's not easy to live here.

00:27:43.665 --> 00:27:44.705
I have the skills.

00:27:44.785 --> 00:27:46.305
Of course, I'll try to make money.

00:27:56.425 --> 00:27:57.265
What's wrong?

00:28:01.025 --> 00:28:03.025
You are really lucky.

00:28:04.025 --> 00:28:05.505
It hasn't even been five days.

00:28:05.585 --> 00:28:07.225
If you had come to me later,

00:28:07.305 --> 00:28:09.425
I'm afraid this eye would be lost.

00:28:17.465 --> 00:28:18.705
How does it feel?

00:28:21.745 --> 00:28:23.585
It's hurting less now.

00:28:24.225 --> 00:28:25.385
Not that itchy, either.

00:28:28.105 --> 00:28:28.985
Boss.

00:28:40.625 --> 00:28:41.545
Your badge.

00:28:50.985 --> 00:28:52.585
- Open it.
- Who are you?

00:28:54.865 --> 00:28:55.985
COURT OF JUDICIAL REVIEW BADGE

00:28:59.025 --> 00:29:01.505
Someone is smuggling salt
via water transportation.

00:29:01.585 --> 00:29:03.385
The Court of Judicial Review
received a tip.

00:29:03.465 --> 00:29:04.465
We're here for inspection.

00:29:08.345 --> 00:29:09.345
Go ahead.

00:29:11.545 --> 00:29:13.185
No matter what's in these crates,

00:29:13.265 --> 00:29:15.225
you can't escape the charge
of stealing from your own post.

00:29:16.305 --> 00:29:18.745
We only received cloth and silk
in the storeroom today.

00:29:18.825 --> 00:29:19.865
There's no smuggled salt.

00:29:19.945 --> 00:29:23.105
We have even more reason
to investigate now.

00:29:27.665 --> 00:29:30.025
These are all the goods
in the past two days.

00:29:34.465 --> 00:29:35.465
What…

00:29:37.465 --> 00:29:38.625
No one is allowed to leave

00:29:39.185 --> 00:29:40.345
until we are done.

00:29:40.425 --> 00:29:42.545
You're alright. This is enough.

00:29:43.065 --> 00:29:45.065
Three cents. Leave it in my medicine box.

00:29:45.145 --> 00:29:46.345
Please stay.

00:29:47.105 --> 00:29:48.865
There's another patient waiting for you.

00:29:57.985 --> 00:30:01.145
The one who needs your treatment
is this gentleman.

00:30:05.105 --> 00:30:06.785
I may not be a noble person,

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:08.745
but I won't let you toy with me like this.

00:30:11.785 --> 00:30:13.305
That man is tall.

00:30:13.385 --> 00:30:15.065
He has a scar
on the back of his right hand.

00:30:15.825 --> 00:30:16.945
Sanniang, don't be mad.

00:30:17.025 --> 00:30:18.425
You saw it too.

00:30:18.505 --> 00:30:20.345
This is a serious matter.

00:30:20.425 --> 00:30:21.785
I dare not be reckless.

00:30:21.865 --> 00:30:24.225
So I had to verify
your medical skills first.

00:30:24.305 --> 00:30:25.585
I wasn't toying with you.

00:30:27.945 --> 00:30:29.185
You poisoned him

00:30:29.785 --> 00:30:31.265
just to test my medical skills?

00:30:33.545 --> 00:30:35.105
It's only because

00:30:35.185 --> 00:30:37.745
there are too many swindlers out there.

00:30:38.745 --> 00:30:40.105
You have exquisite medical skills.

00:30:40.185 --> 00:30:42.625
I will pay you handsomely if you cure me.

00:30:45.265 --> 00:30:46.585
You are shrewd, ruthless,

00:30:47.225 --> 00:30:48.225
and no ordinary person.

00:30:48.745 --> 00:30:49.585
How do I address you?

00:30:49.665 --> 00:30:52.305
I rank third in my family just like you.

00:30:52.385 --> 00:30:53.425
Just call me Third Master.

00:30:54.505 --> 00:30:56.625
Third Master. Please.

00:31:09.385 --> 00:31:11.105
My eye

00:31:11.705 --> 00:31:13.025
is destroyed.

00:31:16.385 --> 00:31:18.145
The poison has reached the flesh.

00:31:18.225 --> 00:31:20.265
If left untreated,
it will get to the bones

00:31:20.985 --> 00:31:23.145
and kill you with unbearable headaches.

00:31:25.105 --> 00:31:26.505
I'm counting on you.

00:32:07.905 --> 00:32:09.665
They dare let us check these crates.

00:32:10.225 --> 00:32:12.625
It means Yudi is not in there.

00:32:44.425 --> 00:32:46.625
The meridian and collateral needling
you performed

00:32:47.305 --> 00:32:49.265
were authentic Nine Needling Methods.

00:32:49.865 --> 00:32:50.825
Sanniang.

00:32:50.905 --> 00:32:52.905
You're not a traveling physician.

00:32:54.585 --> 00:32:57.305
I did perform
the authentic Nine Needling Methods.

00:32:57.385 --> 00:32:58.945
But that evolved from

00:32:59.025 --> 00:33:00.905
the folk practice,
"Turtle Diagram Eight Techniques."

00:33:00.985 --> 00:33:04.305
Third Master, don't start showing off
just because I'm good-looking.

00:33:21.105 --> 00:33:22.585
These are for the palace.

00:33:22.665 --> 00:33:23.985
Show me a warranty

00:33:24.505 --> 00:33:25.425
before you touch them.

00:33:26.345 --> 00:33:27.225
Behave.

00:33:33.225 --> 00:33:34.705
Don't push your luck.

00:34:21.304 --> 00:34:23.225
Herbal smell. It's here.

00:34:27.025 --> 00:34:28.625
One acupuncture session

00:34:28.705 --> 00:34:30.545
can't fully remove the poison.

00:34:31.225 --> 00:34:33.105
Steam your eye for a ke
in the morning and evening respectively.

00:34:33.185 --> 00:34:35.465
Three days later, we will do this again.

00:34:35.545 --> 00:34:39.505
In your opinion,
how long will it take to heal?

00:34:43.824 --> 00:34:45.025
At least a month.

00:34:45.105 --> 00:34:47.784
But next time, I won't be here again.

00:34:48.304 --> 00:34:49.264
You have a toxin in your system.

00:34:49.344 --> 00:34:52.465
Moving around makes it spread faster.

00:34:52.545 --> 00:34:54.465
I can go to your mansion.

00:34:57.785 --> 00:35:00.505
No need. Just follow me now.

00:35:08.425 --> 00:35:09.265
What are you doing?

00:35:09.345 --> 00:35:10.705
Let me go.

00:35:10.785 --> 00:35:12.265
Let go.

00:35:13.785 --> 00:35:14.745
Let go.

00:35:18.345 --> 00:35:19.225
Why are you scared?

00:35:19.825 --> 00:35:22.985
Isn't it your job
as a physician to save lives?

00:35:23.065 --> 00:35:26.345
You are a traveling physician
who doesn't reside in one place.

00:35:26.425 --> 00:35:28.905
Follow me home,
and I will provide for you.

00:35:28.985 --> 00:35:30.185
Unless you're scared

00:35:30.265 --> 00:35:32.345
the Imperial Medical Office
won't be able to find you.

00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:36.545
Afraid that Li Peiyi
won't be able to find you?

00:35:54.065 --> 00:35:55.105
Let her go.

00:36:04.905 --> 00:36:06.665
I knew it was you behind this.

00:36:10.625 --> 00:36:13.745
Which old acquaintance are you?

00:36:16.305 --> 00:36:17.825
You owe my master your life.

00:36:18.345 --> 00:36:19.585
I need to find you to make you pay.

00:36:19.665 --> 00:36:23.585
Did Du Zhixing only teach you
to talk tough all these years?

00:36:24.985 --> 00:36:26.825
I'm afraid you don't know
what I'm capable of.

00:36:29.665 --> 00:36:32.945
Last time, that old man died for you.

00:36:33.025 --> 00:36:34.385
This time,

00:36:34.465 --> 00:36:36.225
you won't be able to escape.

00:36:36.985 --> 00:36:38.545
I finally tracked you down.

00:36:38.625 --> 00:36:39.665
Why would I rush to leave?

00:36:39.745 --> 00:36:42.185
I wanted to have a serious talk with you.

00:36:42.265 --> 00:36:43.665
I'm a difficult person.

00:36:43.745 --> 00:36:45.745
If you don't make things clear,

00:36:45.825 --> 00:36:46.665
I won't leave.

00:36:47.785 --> 00:36:49.945
This is my territory.

00:36:50.025 --> 00:36:51.065
It's not up to you.

00:36:54.705 --> 00:36:55.545
We don't know

00:36:56.145 --> 00:36:57.545
who will die first.

00:37:06.025 --> 00:37:08.345
You evil woman! What did you do?

00:37:08.425 --> 00:37:09.465
I…

00:37:09.545 --> 00:37:11.305
I administered acupuncture.
I didn't do anything.

00:37:13.865 --> 00:37:15.025
Physician Zhao has medical ethics.

00:37:15.105 --> 00:37:17.385
She knows that you deserve to die,

00:37:17.465 --> 00:37:18.705
but still does her best to cure you.

00:37:18.785 --> 00:37:21.945
What a pity. Medical ethics is something

00:37:22.025 --> 00:37:22.865
I don't have.

00:37:24.905 --> 00:37:28.425
I knew you were cautious enough
to test her in advance.

00:37:28.505 --> 00:37:30.145
So except for this first row of needles,

00:37:30.225 --> 00:37:33.185
I've poisoned all the other needles.

00:37:34.105 --> 00:37:36.105
- You…
- Your Ladyship.

00:37:36.185 --> 00:37:38.225
How can you meddle
with my acupuncture kit?

00:37:38.305 --> 00:37:40.065
You're ruining my reputation.

00:37:41.425 --> 00:37:42.945
A villain like me administered the poison.

00:37:43.665 --> 00:37:45.105
You're practically his savior

00:37:45.185 --> 00:37:46.625
if you can help him detoxify.

00:37:46.705 --> 00:37:48.225
Don't you agree?

00:37:50.305 --> 00:37:51.425
Give me the antidote.

00:37:52.385 --> 00:37:53.305
This is

00:37:53.385 --> 00:37:56.185
Physician Zhao,
the top expert in detoxification.

00:37:56.265 --> 00:37:57.185
She's here.

00:37:57.265 --> 00:37:58.465
So I didn't bring the antidote.

00:37:59.505 --> 00:38:00.345
You…

00:38:01.785 --> 00:38:03.065
You…

00:38:06.745 --> 00:38:07.825
You should remain calm.

00:38:07.905 --> 00:38:08.745
I know you're in pain.

00:38:08.825 --> 00:38:11.105
B-But don't get worked up. Let me see.

00:38:12.385 --> 00:38:13.225
Li Peiyi.

00:38:13.305 --> 00:38:15.985
Tell her what poison you used.

00:38:16.065 --> 00:38:17.705
No, no. Don't give me tips.

00:38:18.865 --> 00:38:19.985
Let me insert the needles now.

00:38:20.065 --> 00:38:21.305
Aren't the needles poisonous?

00:38:21.385 --> 00:38:24.265
I took the first row ones.
They're safe. Stop talking.

00:38:24.345 --> 00:38:25.465
Or I can't save you anymore.

00:38:25.545 --> 00:38:27.225
Sit down.

00:38:50.985 --> 00:38:53.505
I can't detoxify you yet,
but I can relieve your pain.

00:38:53.585 --> 00:38:55.105
You won't die.

00:38:56.145 --> 00:38:58.065
Just answer Her Ladyship's questions.

00:38:58.145 --> 00:38:59.825
I'll come up with a prescription tonight.

00:38:59.905 --> 00:39:02.665
But I'll bring it to you once you go back

00:39:02.745 --> 00:39:03.585
with Her Ladyship.

00:39:04.385 --> 00:39:05.305
Lunatic.

00:39:05.905 --> 00:39:07.985
Both of you. You're crazy.

00:39:08.065 --> 00:39:10.185
Wuren, Mr. Xiao,
please take Physician Zhao

00:39:10.265 --> 00:39:11.425
back to the palace.

00:39:13.305 --> 00:39:14.265
Get up.

00:39:24.225 --> 00:39:26.265
Confess. Who are you?

00:39:31.385 --> 00:39:34.425
Callused hands with deformed knuckles.

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:35.745
Signs of martial arts training.

00:39:35.825 --> 00:39:37.905
You are a military man
with an official title.

00:39:37.985 --> 00:39:38.865
That's for sure.

00:39:39.465 --> 00:39:43.145
Even if I don't remember the names
of every military official,

00:39:43.225 --> 00:39:44.465
I've seen most of them.

00:39:44.545 --> 00:39:45.865
But I've never seen you.

00:39:46.465 --> 00:39:48.065
You are a stationed officer?

00:39:56.425 --> 00:39:58.465
I've seen men
who have campaigned for years,

00:39:58.545 --> 00:40:00.985
sleeping rough in the grass,
buried in snow,

00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:03.505
their wrists and shoulders
scarred by armor.

00:40:03.585 --> 00:40:04.625
But nothing on you.

00:40:05.225 --> 00:40:07.065
So the Protectorate you serve

00:40:07.145 --> 00:40:09.425
must have known peace
for at least five years.

00:40:10.105 --> 00:40:11.025
That means…

00:40:11.905 --> 00:40:12.745
Andong Protectorate.

00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:20.065
Military officials can't return
unless they are called.

00:40:20.145 --> 00:40:23.265
You've been in the Western Capital
for quite a while

00:40:23.345 --> 00:40:24.785
but haven't seen His Majesty.

00:40:25.385 --> 00:40:26.665
You must have come
with the Protector-General

00:40:26.745 --> 00:40:27.625
to deliver his official report.

00:40:27.705 --> 00:40:28.865
But given your rank,

00:40:28.945 --> 00:40:31.345
you weren't allowed to see His Majesty.

00:40:31.425 --> 00:40:34.185
I'll leave it at that.

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:36.345
It's easy, even if you don't confess.

00:40:36.425 --> 00:40:39.305
I'll cut off your head and show it around.

00:40:39.385 --> 00:40:40.585
Someone will recognize you.

00:40:40.665 --> 00:40:41.265
‪LV CHONGSHAN,
‪GENERAL OF THE ANDONG PROTECTORATE

00:40:41.345 --> 00:40:43.105
At this point,

00:40:43.625 --> 00:40:45.145
there's no point in hiding anything.

00:40:46.665 --> 00:40:49.625
I'm Lv Chongshan.
General of the Andong Protectorate.

00:40:51.105 --> 00:40:52.345
Lv Chongshan.

00:40:56.345 --> 00:40:58.345
Even if I ask you who sent you to kill me,

00:40:58.425 --> 00:40:59.945
I bet you won't tell me.

00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:03.145
I thought you were just a pawn.

00:41:03.225 --> 00:41:04.265
Now it seems

00:41:04.865 --> 00:41:06.385
that you were involved in that massacre

00:41:06.985 --> 00:41:07.905
15 years ago.

00:41:09.185 --> 00:41:10.545
Didn't you lose your memory?

00:41:11.145 --> 00:41:13.985
Why don't you live an easy life in peace?

00:41:14.065 --> 00:41:16.585
Why bother sneaking around
and looking into what happened back then?

00:41:17.185 --> 00:41:19.025
That's typical of women.

00:41:19.105 --> 00:41:20.985
When things get real, you lose your head.

00:41:24.265 --> 00:41:25.505
I'm a woman, so what?

00:41:26.025 --> 00:41:27.585
I will be able to take revenge.

00:41:28.225 --> 00:41:29.105
Take revenge?

00:41:29.785 --> 00:41:31.385
We don't let you look into it

00:41:31.465 --> 00:41:34.505
to protect the reputation of your parents.

00:41:34.585 --> 00:41:36.585
So what if you kill me?

00:41:36.665 --> 00:41:38.745
You're just a petty general.

00:41:38.825 --> 00:41:39.985
They will abandon you

00:41:40.505 --> 00:41:42.585
when necessary,
no matter how capable you are.

00:41:43.585 --> 00:41:45.305
Tell me everything you know.

00:41:45.385 --> 00:41:46.505
Maybe I can save you.

00:41:49.585 --> 00:41:51.465
I don't need you to save me.

00:41:52.065 --> 00:41:54.505
I'm afraid you think
too highly of yourself.

00:41:54.585 --> 00:41:56.665
His Majesty does adore you.

00:41:56.745 --> 00:41:59.105
But if you bring up that scandal,

00:41:59.185 --> 00:42:00.625
he won't tolerate you.

00:42:04.305 --> 00:42:06.745
In the end, you people

00:42:06.825 --> 00:42:08.705
only care about ranks and wages,

00:42:08.785 --> 00:42:11.345
life and death, and His Majesty's favor.

00:42:11.865 --> 00:42:13.105
But I don't care at all.

00:42:14.625 --> 00:42:15.865
But you

00:42:16.585 --> 00:42:19.665
seem rather terrified that your master
will abandon you.

00:42:20.465 --> 00:42:21.305
You should be.

00:42:21.385 --> 00:42:24.305
After all, he let you roam around
and seek treatment

00:42:24.385 --> 00:42:25.585
all by yourself.

00:42:27.225 --> 00:42:28.945
The Prince of Duan
colluded with foreign powers

00:42:29.025 --> 00:42:30.225
and plotted rebellion in secret.

00:42:30.305 --> 00:42:32.705
He thought highly of himself
and defied His Majesty.

00:42:35.305 --> 00:42:36.625
Should I go on?

00:42:38.105 --> 00:42:41.425
You worked so hard
to fabricate this story.

00:42:41.505 --> 00:42:42.745
Can you leave it unfinished?

00:42:46.025 --> 00:42:47.465
At the end of that year,

00:42:47.545 --> 00:42:48.665
Prince of Duan returned

00:42:49.265 --> 00:42:52.185
and secretly brought a branch
of the Jianning Iron Army

00:42:52.265 --> 00:42:55.025
to station in the Western Capital.

00:42:56.185 --> 00:42:59.225
Everyone said that he was planning
to rebel on the Lantern Festival.

00:42:59.305 --> 00:43:01.665
His Majesty naturally heard about it.

00:43:02.265 --> 00:43:04.705
But considering the Prince of Duan's
military achievements,

00:43:04.785 --> 00:43:07.225
His Majesty still summoned him
at the Hai hour that night.

00:43:08.065 --> 00:43:10.265
But the Prince of Duan defied His Majesty

00:43:10.785 --> 00:43:13.185
and refused to enter
the palace out of arrogance.

00:43:14.065 --> 00:43:16.665
That day, Father and I
were celebrating at home.

00:43:17.185 --> 00:43:19.225
He never mentioned
any decree from His Majesty.

00:43:19.305 --> 00:43:21.025
He was plotting a rebellion.

00:43:21.105 --> 00:43:23.505
Of course, he wouldn't care about
the imperial decrees.

00:43:30.465 --> 00:43:32.585
Your stories are full of loopholes

00:43:32.665 --> 00:43:33.945
and make no sense.

00:43:34.825 --> 00:43:36.345
If he was plotting a rebellion,

00:43:36.425 --> 00:43:38.785
why did he lose it and kill everyone?

00:43:39.825 --> 00:43:41.265
That night,

00:43:41.345 --> 00:43:43.545
over a dozen armed Jianning troops

00:43:43.625 --> 00:43:45.305
were arrested in the Western Capital.

00:43:45.385 --> 00:43:48.025
As the Left General
of the Imperial Guards,

00:43:48.105 --> 00:43:50.865
I went to invite the Prince of Duan
by His Majesty's decree.

00:43:50.945 --> 00:43:53.545
Knowing that his plan was exposed,
he was cornered

00:43:53.625 --> 00:43:55.025
and intended to fight us.

00:43:55.105 --> 00:43:56.745
Princess Consort of Duan
tried to reason with him.

00:43:56.825 --> 00:43:58.465
But he suddenly lost it

00:43:58.545 --> 00:44:00.985
and killed everyone in the mansion,

00:44:02.145 --> 00:44:04.345
including Princess Consort of Duan.

00:44:05.305 --> 00:44:07.145
I narrowly escaped

00:44:07.225 --> 00:44:09.825
with serious injury
and reported it to His Majesty.

00:44:09.905 --> 00:44:12.145
To preserve the dignity of Prince of Duan,

00:44:12.225 --> 00:44:14.825
His Majesty never mentioned
the potential rebellion.

00:44:22.585 --> 00:44:24.665
The illustrious Jianning Iron Army

00:44:25.265 --> 00:44:28.985
was quietly dismissed after the incident.

00:44:29.065 --> 00:44:32.065
The leading generals
disappeared into thin air.

00:44:32.825 --> 00:44:34.745
Has Your Ladyship truly

00:44:34.825 --> 00:44:37.425
never wondered what lies behind all this?
