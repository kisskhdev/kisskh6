WEBVTT

00:00:41.396 --> 00:00:44.066
NO TAIL TO TELL

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:46.360
{\an8}What if…

00:00:49.613 --> 00:00:51.281
{\an8}I don't want to be normal?

00:00:53.158 --> 00:00:54.034
{\an8}What?

00:00:54.117 --> 00:00:56.578
{\an8}If you're just going to erase my memory

00:00:57.496 --> 00:00:59.915
{\an8}and be the only one
who remembers this moment,

00:01:00.957 --> 00:01:03.710
{\an8}then I should be allowed to do
at least this much, right?

00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:06.296
{\an8}What do you mean…

00:01:21.687 --> 00:01:23.939
{\an8}What… do you think you're doing?

00:01:24.564 --> 00:01:26.817
{\an8}Unlike you, I'm not good
at doing things half-heartedly.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.070
If I decide to do something,
I have to put all my heart into it.

00:01:30.153 --> 00:01:33.198
Wait. What do you mean?

00:01:34.157 --> 00:01:36.410
Let's date. For real.

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.745
I'm serious.

00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:45.919
You're still wet behind the ears.
Where did you learn to do that?

00:01:46.586 --> 00:01:48.547
What do you think you're doing?

00:01:49.506 --> 00:01:50.924
Why are you so flustered?

00:01:51.675 --> 00:01:54.428
- Is there a problem?
- Of course there is.

00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:58.098
Once we go back to how we were,
we'll never see each other again.

00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:00.225
So you coming on so strong like this

00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:03.395
is overwhelming.

00:02:03.937 --> 00:02:06.148
Then you shouldn't have led me on.

00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:07.607
I'm just getting started.

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:11.486
Why? Do you want to stop?

00:02:14.698 --> 00:02:16.533
When did I ever lead you on?

00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:23.290
Don't think about running,
and don't just dip your toes in.

00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:31.131
Let's do this right. You and I both.

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:35.677
From now on, I'm done joking around.

00:02:45.812 --> 00:02:50.567
EPISODE 9
LOVE ATTACK

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.361
That nine-tailed fox.

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:56.531
She said she became human.

00:02:58.408 --> 00:02:59.868
What?

00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:03.205
She's just an ordinary human now.

00:03:04.915 --> 00:03:06.333
An ordinary human?

00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:10.629
An ordinary human.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.301
Then that fox

00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:19.137
has no power anymore,

00:03:19.971 --> 00:03:22.140
and there's no reason to be afraid of her.

00:03:26.686 --> 00:03:28.396
This just got interesting.

00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:31.733
What are you going to do?

00:03:31.817 --> 00:03:33.777
- About what?
- What do you think?

00:03:34.611 --> 00:03:37.614
Now that things are in our favor,
you're not going after that damn fox?

00:03:37.697 --> 00:03:38.615
Why should I?

00:03:39.908 --> 00:03:41.243
What?

00:03:41.326 --> 00:03:43.161
Whether I skin it or roast it,

00:03:43.245 --> 00:03:46.414
I won't get blood on my hands
unless there's something to gain.

00:03:47.707 --> 00:03:50.210
Wait, what does that…

00:03:51.545 --> 00:03:54.339
They say cultivated beasts have an orb.

00:03:54.965 --> 00:03:57.843
Dragons hold dragon orbs
to call the wind and rain.

00:03:57.926 --> 00:04:02.097
Nine-tailed foxes have fox beads
to perform their infinite tricks.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.226
But if that fox
really became an ordinary human,

00:04:06.852 --> 00:04:09.271
her bead must've already shattered
and vanished.

00:04:10.105 --> 00:04:12.315
So, I'm not interested anymore.

00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:15.277
But look at what we suffered

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.696
because of that damn beast
that's not even human!

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.199
We were hiding like rats,
cowering in fear!

00:04:21.867 --> 00:04:24.619
Am I the only one who feels like shit?

00:04:25.537 --> 00:04:27.330
You all do, don't you?

00:04:27.414 --> 00:04:29.457
Didn't I tell you before?

00:04:29.541 --> 00:04:32.085
A hunter doesn't hunt
because of a personal grudge.

00:04:33.712 --> 00:04:35.714
Damn you.

00:04:40.635 --> 00:04:41.803
Wait a second.

00:04:48.268 --> 00:04:50.270
Then who erased your memory?

00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:05.327
She's an ordinary human now.
How could she have erased your memories?

00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:11.207
What trick are you trying to pull?

00:05:13.335 --> 00:05:14.961
She's not the one

00:05:15.837 --> 00:05:17.464
who did it.

00:05:18.757 --> 00:05:19.883
Then who was it?

00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:23.303
I don't know if she was
a nine-tailed fox or what,

00:05:24.596 --> 00:05:26.514
but there was someone else there.

00:05:47.994 --> 00:05:49.663
Let's date. For real.

00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:52.707
I'm serious.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.642
This is driving me nuts.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.896
What's wrong with me?
I couldn't sleep at all.

00:06:17.482 --> 00:06:20.402
And why am I so thirsty?

00:06:21.486 --> 00:06:23.071
Gosh.

00:06:23.154 --> 00:06:26.241
I'm dying of thirst,
but it's too awkward to go out.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.419
What was I thinking yesterday?

00:06:37.502 --> 00:06:39.963
Unlike you, I'm not good
at doing things half-heartedly.

00:06:40.046 --> 00:06:43.008
If I decide to do something,
I have to put all my heart into it.

00:06:43.091 --> 00:06:44.968
Put all my heart into what?

00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:47.637
Then you shouldn't have led me on.

00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:49.222
I'm just getting started.

00:06:49.305 --> 00:06:51.641
What's wrong with me?

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:57.480
I must've lost it.

00:07:07.365 --> 00:07:09.242
She's going to wake up soon.

00:07:10.243 --> 00:07:13.371
It's going to be so awkward.
How am I supposed to face her?

00:07:33.892 --> 00:07:35.852
Did he really leave?

00:07:51.117 --> 00:07:52.619
This is so awkward.

00:07:53.912 --> 00:07:56.039
He could've just played along.

00:07:56.122 --> 00:07:58.249
Why did he suddenly get so bold?

00:07:58.333 --> 00:08:00.085
I didn't expect him to just…

00:08:00.585 --> 00:08:02.253
It caught me off guard.

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:08.927
Oh, crap.

00:08:24.901 --> 00:08:27.570
Hi, did you sleep well?

00:08:28.196 --> 00:08:29.447
Yeah.

00:08:30.365 --> 00:08:32.158
What are you doing?

00:08:32.826 --> 00:08:34.786
Oh, this…

00:08:40.875 --> 00:08:42.418
Nothing.

00:08:42.502 --> 00:08:45.171
I was just picking something up.

00:08:46.381 --> 00:08:47.632
I see.

00:08:52.428 --> 00:08:55.265
Leave or just stay. Make up your mind.

00:08:55.348 --> 00:08:58.184
Why do you keep going back and forth?
It's confusing.

00:08:58.726 --> 00:09:00.562
Oh, I forgot to give you this.

00:09:11.573 --> 00:09:13.032
I'm heading out to exercise.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.329
I might be late, and you could get hungry.

00:09:18.872 --> 00:09:22.125
You should use this
to buy yourself something to eat.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:23.918
Okay.

00:09:28.923 --> 00:09:31.718
But why are you suddenly
exercising at the crack of dawn?

00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:33.136
Well,

00:09:33.219 --> 00:09:34.846
I recently realized

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.850
that my body's a total wreck right now.

00:09:39.851 --> 00:09:44.856
My balance is off,
and I don't have any stamina.

00:09:44.939 --> 00:09:45.940
I see.

00:09:51.905 --> 00:09:53.781
Okay, well…

00:09:55.116 --> 00:09:56.701
I'm off to work out.

00:09:58.745 --> 00:10:00.455
Oh, sure.

00:10:00.997 --> 00:10:03.124
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:10:20.099 --> 00:10:21.142
Do you…

00:10:23.102 --> 00:10:24.229
want to come along?

00:10:25.396 --> 00:10:26.648
What?

00:10:35.406 --> 00:10:36.491
Si-yeol.

00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:39.035
The thing is…

00:10:42.163 --> 00:10:43.456
my memory came back.

00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:48.253
What are you people planning to do?

00:10:49.462 --> 00:10:52.674
You don't have to worry about your friend.

00:10:52.757 --> 00:10:56.386
I'm only interested in the fox bead.

00:10:57.303 --> 00:11:00.807
It's not like Si-yeol
will be in any real danger.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.517
I should just stay out of this.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.603
Then whatever happens isn't my fault.

00:11:11.985 --> 00:11:14.696
But what if they actually kill
that nine-tailed fox?

00:11:18.491 --> 00:11:22.412
Would Si-yeol
have to live my life forever?

00:11:22.954 --> 00:11:23.913
Gosh.

00:11:27.041 --> 00:11:28.710
Woo-seok.

00:11:28.793 --> 00:11:30.420
Dad.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.381
You feeling okay?

00:11:33.464 --> 00:11:35.967
It's not like I drank last night,

00:11:36.467 --> 00:11:37.927
but I don't remember a thing.

00:11:39.095 --> 00:11:40.638
Are you sure you're okay?

00:11:40.722 --> 00:11:41.889
Don't even ask.

00:11:41.973 --> 00:11:44.726
Maybe it was all the stress
from getting the press to bury the story

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:46.936
of you beating someone up last week.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.022
Man, I totally blacked out.

00:11:50.982 --> 00:11:52.567
Is it morning already?

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.111
Today's the call-up
for the international match!

00:11:56.487 --> 00:11:58.823
- International match?
- Man, what time is it?

00:11:59.449 --> 00:12:00.700
We've got to get ready fast.

00:12:00.783 --> 00:12:02.744
Go wash up. I'll pack your bags.

00:12:36.402 --> 00:12:39.113
Let's start with some stretching.

00:12:39.781 --> 00:12:42.075
- Stretching?
- Like this.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.787
Keep your feet straight.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.038
- Okay.
- Good job.

00:12:47.121 --> 00:12:49.624
- Now go down. Reach.
- Okay.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.213
Wait, is that it?

00:12:55.296 --> 00:12:56.381
Yeah.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.883
What? Surely not.

00:12:58.966 --> 00:13:01.469
Let's try again. There's no way
a human body can be that stiff.

00:13:01.552 --> 00:13:02.678
What?

00:13:03.221 --> 00:13:05.014
Now, breathe out.

00:13:10.645 --> 00:13:13.022
- I can't go any lower.
- That's really it?

00:13:14.774 --> 00:13:16.401
- Something's wrong with you.
- What?

00:13:16.484 --> 00:13:18.361
Okay, breathe out.

00:13:18.444 --> 00:13:20.071
Exhale.

00:13:20.571 --> 00:13:21.989
See? You can go lower.

00:13:22.073 --> 00:13:24.200
One, two, three, four.

00:13:24.283 --> 00:13:25.910
Breathe out.

00:13:25.993 --> 00:13:27.954
- Exhale.
- I am!

00:13:28.037 --> 00:13:30.748
Now, the sides. The other side.

00:13:30.832 --> 00:13:31.999
Exhale.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.335
Let go, Si-yeol.

00:13:34.419 --> 00:13:36.421
- Let go!
- You're fine.

00:13:36.504 --> 00:13:38.339
I'm telling you, I'm not!

00:13:38.423 --> 00:13:41.426
- Stretch!
- I'm going to kill you!

00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:43.428
Good job.

00:13:44.887 --> 00:13:46.431
- Done resting?
- What?

00:13:47.306 --> 00:13:48.850
- Now, exhale.
- Exhale.

00:13:48.933 --> 00:13:51.477
- Exhale.
- Exhale!

00:13:53.354 --> 00:13:56.899
Si-yeol, I think I'm done.

00:13:56.983 --> 00:13:59.444
- What?
- I'm done exercising for today.

00:14:00.319 --> 00:14:03.573
What are you talking about?
We only just finished stretching.

00:14:05.366 --> 00:14:06.451
Let's run a bit.

00:14:06.534 --> 00:14:07.869
No. You go.

00:14:07.952 --> 00:14:10.037
I'm going to rest here for a bit.

00:14:10.121 --> 00:14:11.747
Running just makes you sweaty.

00:14:13.374 --> 00:14:15.668
That's exactly why you run.

00:14:18.254 --> 00:14:20.923
Look at them running.
Don't they look cool?

00:14:21.966 --> 00:14:23.593
Running will make you feel great.

00:14:26.596 --> 00:14:29.432
Okay, one, two, one, two, one.

00:14:30.641 --> 00:14:33.644
Si-yeol, how far do we have to run?

00:14:33.728 --> 00:14:37.773
Let's run just up to there.
Come on, you can do it!

00:14:38.941 --> 00:14:41.819
You got this. Let's go!

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.654
That's it.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.037
Why on earth do humans do this

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.164
instead of using perfectly good cars?

00:14:54.957 --> 00:14:56.834
Isn't this self-torture?

00:15:01.714 --> 00:15:02.882
Here.

00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:10.348
The water tastes so good, right?

00:15:10.848 --> 00:15:12.767
Yeah, I feel much better.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:13.809
And the breeze is cool.

00:15:13.893 --> 00:15:14.894
Doesn't it feel good?

00:15:20.608 --> 00:15:22.235
I guess.

00:15:22.735 --> 00:15:24.237
You did great.

00:15:25.154 --> 00:15:27.573
I thought you'd quit halfway,
but you stuck with it.

00:15:28.366 --> 00:15:29.575
This is nothing.

00:15:33.162 --> 00:15:34.205
Man, it's hot.

00:15:35.122 --> 00:15:38.292
You'll catch a cold
if you take that off now.

00:16:06.571 --> 00:16:07.697
There.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.245
We're already warmed up.
Do you want to do a bit more?

00:16:15.246 --> 00:16:16.497
What?

00:16:19.166 --> 00:16:21.168
Wait. Run more?

00:16:21.877 --> 00:16:23.087
No.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.173
Let's go play some soccer.

00:16:28.676 --> 00:16:30.886
- Do you want to make a bet?
- A bet?

00:16:31.429 --> 00:16:34.557
If you can take this ball from me,
I'll grant you a wish.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.684
- For real?
- Of course.

00:16:37.602 --> 00:16:40.229
How hard could it be
to take the ball from you?

00:16:40.313 --> 00:16:43.482
Anything I want, right? No take-backs.

00:16:44.567 --> 00:16:45.818
Are you even trying?

00:16:46.986 --> 00:16:47.903
Just you wait.

00:16:51.157 --> 00:16:52.617
Whoa, easy with the hands.

00:16:57.747 --> 00:16:58.873
Hey.

00:17:00.499 --> 00:17:01.792
Wait.

00:17:15.056 --> 00:17:17.058
Hey, that's a foul!

00:17:17.141 --> 00:17:19.018
How is that a foul?

00:17:19.894 --> 00:17:21.145
Here.

00:17:22.313 --> 00:17:24.565
Ok-sun, try harder.
Are you giving up already?

00:17:25.191 --> 00:17:27.026
You're wearing knee pads, right?

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:28.194
What?

00:17:30.529 --> 00:17:32.490
- Yes!
- Hey, that's a foul.

00:17:32.573 --> 00:17:34.909
That was really a foul.

00:17:54.387 --> 00:17:56.806
- I won, right?
- What?

00:17:58.015 --> 00:18:00.726
Why are you staring at me?
Is there something on my face?

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.479
No, it's nothing.

00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:10.319
Want to go again?
It's fun now that I took it from you.

00:18:10.403 --> 00:18:13.239
Let's do it. No fouls this time.

00:18:13.322 --> 00:18:14.448
You too.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:19.829
Hey, wait. I said no fouls.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.335
What should I wish for?

00:18:26.419 --> 00:18:29.672
I've only ever granted wishes.
I've never made one myself,

00:18:29.755 --> 00:18:31.424
so I don't know what to ask for.

00:18:31.507 --> 00:18:33.551
Hey, I told you that was a foul.

00:18:33.634 --> 00:18:36.429
Says who?
You didn't say that at the start.

00:18:36.512 --> 00:18:39.682
Do I really have to explain
that kicking someone's shins is a foul?

00:18:39.765 --> 00:18:42.017
Don't be petty. Just admit I won.

00:18:42.101 --> 00:18:45.980
You're a pro. Do you really have to try
that hard to beat a regular person?

00:18:47.148 --> 00:18:49.692
Jeez, you always have a comeback.

00:18:50.818 --> 00:18:52.862
Fine, let's just say you won.

00:18:53.404 --> 00:18:54.530
Yes!

00:19:03.497 --> 00:19:04.957
- Give me your hand.
- What?

00:19:06.292 --> 00:19:08.669
We're on a date right now.

00:19:08.753 --> 00:19:11.005
I just want to hold hands while we walk.

00:19:42.244 --> 00:19:46.749
So,
what should we do when we get home?

00:19:46.832 --> 00:19:51.545
Actually, I'm not going home.
I've got to go train right away.

00:19:52.338 --> 00:19:55.716
What do you mean?
We've been working out this whole time.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.386
That was just my own workout.
Now I have to train with the team.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.723
Why bother?
It won't matter once we go back.

00:20:02.807 --> 00:20:04.266
I have to make money.

00:20:04.809 --> 00:20:07.603
They said I need to win matches
to get paid a decent amount.

00:20:08.687 --> 00:20:11.232
Plus, we don't have much to do right now.

00:20:11.315 --> 00:20:15.361
Don't we have to wait until that chairman
actually hands over the building?

00:20:15.861 --> 00:20:18.155
Well, yeah.

00:20:18.906 --> 00:20:22.284
After I get my win bonus
from this weekend's match,

00:20:22.368 --> 00:20:25.621
I'll treat you to something nice.
Something better than pork cutlets.

00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:30.251
No, wait.

00:20:31.168 --> 00:20:33.546
Eun-ho, should we go on a trip?

00:20:34.421 --> 00:20:36.173
A trip? Just like that?

00:20:36.257 --> 00:20:40.845
Well, the match this weekend
is in Suncheon.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.514
I heard the reed fields are nice there.

00:20:43.597 --> 00:20:48.978
We could go together, look around,
and get something nice to eat.

00:20:49.061 --> 00:20:50.229
How about it?

00:20:50.855 --> 00:20:52.523
Sure, whatever.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:54.525
That's a promise.

00:20:55.401 --> 00:20:57.820
Then, you should go home and rest.

00:20:57.903 --> 00:20:59.989
You must be tired from all that exercise.

00:21:00.656 --> 00:21:03.492
Actually, I just remembered
I have something to do today.

00:21:03.993 --> 00:21:05.035
What is it?

00:21:05.119 --> 00:21:08.956
We need money for the trip.
I'll make some while you train.

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:10.875
- You?
- I told you.

00:21:10.958 --> 00:21:13.085
You should just focus on soccer

00:21:13.168 --> 00:21:15.045
because I'll bring home tons of money.

Hey, why haven't you been
answering my DMs?

You mean… I haven't been?

00:22:10.517 --> 00:22:13.270
Look at him, acting all distant.

00:22:13.354 --> 00:22:15.230
This is how people change
when they make it big.

00:22:22.071 --> 00:22:24.740
Woo-seok was just so blinding.
I didn't even see you.

00:22:24.823 --> 00:22:26.158
Good to see you.

00:22:27.076 --> 00:22:28.744

- Good.

00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:48.462
Eun-ho is my real name.

00:26:52.382 --> 00:26:53.634
EUN-HO

00:26:54.468 --> 00:26:56.303
KIM OK-SUN

00:26:58.347 --> 00:27:02.059
You know, Ms. Kim Ok-sun,
you're being a little too casual.

00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:06.063
- What?
- Stop speaking informally to me.

00:27:06.563 --> 00:27:08.607
What are you good at, Ms. Ok-sun?

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.984
You were speaking informally too just now.

00:27:11.068 --> 00:27:12.152
Excuse me?

00:27:12.945 --> 00:27:14.696
Nothing. Fine.

00:27:15.322 --> 00:27:17.574
It won't be easy,
but I'll take it as a unique experience.

00:27:17.658 --> 00:27:21.203
I'm good at everything.
There really isn't anything I can't do.

00:27:21.828 --> 00:27:23.997
Oh, really? We've got an ace here.

00:27:24.081 --> 00:27:25.582
Do you like plushies?

00:27:29.461 --> 00:27:31.213
Oh my. How cute.

00:27:39.972 --> 00:27:41.890
Why'd you take that? Throw it away.

00:27:41.974 --> 00:27:43.058
Damn it.

00:27:48.438 --> 00:27:49.856
Seriously?

00:27:55.988 --> 00:27:57.447
I don't want it.

00:27:59.157 --> 00:28:01.285
Hey, you!

00:28:06.123 --> 00:28:07.666
- Wow!
- What's that?

00:28:07.749 --> 00:28:10.919
Stay back! Don't come here. Go away!

00:28:11.003 --> 00:28:13.255
Hey, stop! It'll come off!

00:28:24.391 --> 00:28:25.767
DAEHEUNG CITIZENS FC

00:28:31.148 --> 00:28:33.984
Oh gosh, sir…

00:28:35.444 --> 00:28:36.403
Why are you here?

00:28:36.486 --> 00:28:39.448
Coach, I knocked a bunch of times.

00:28:43.201 --> 00:28:44.119
What do you want?

00:28:44.202 --> 00:28:45.746
Is today's training really canceled?

00:28:49.207 --> 00:28:52.044
Yeah. Didn't you get the message?

00:28:52.127 --> 00:28:55.714
What we need is more practice,
so how could you…

00:28:55.797 --> 00:28:56.923
Man.

00:28:58.717 --> 00:29:01.011
Wait. What is that smell?

00:29:07.351 --> 00:29:08.810
Coach, were you drinking?

00:29:09.394 --> 00:29:11.605
The match is right around the corner,

00:29:11.688 --> 00:29:13.523
but you canceled practice, and now this?

00:29:13.607 --> 00:29:15.484
Gosh, I'm hungover.

00:29:17.569 --> 00:29:18.987
Si-yeol, did you eat yet?

00:29:20.072 --> 00:29:21.156
Pardon?

00:29:21.698 --> 00:29:22.824
Let's go grab a bite.

00:29:24.743 --> 00:29:25.702
Gosh.

00:29:43.804 --> 00:29:46.598
- What is this?
- It's totally burnt.

00:29:47.307 --> 00:29:48.809
You expect us to eat this?

00:29:49.434 --> 00:29:51.937
Should I throw it away then?
That's wasteful.

00:29:53.271 --> 00:29:54.439
Man, I burnt another one.

00:29:55.315 --> 00:29:57.150
It's because you kept talking to me.

00:29:57.234 --> 00:29:59.528
Just eat and move along.

00:30:03.365 --> 00:30:04.699
I'm not buying this.

00:30:14.543 --> 00:30:16.169
Maybe this is a bit too burnt.

00:30:18.547 --> 00:30:21.007
Don't cause trouble this time.

00:30:21.091 --> 00:30:23.135
Got it, Ms. Kim Ok-sun?

00:30:23.218 --> 00:30:24.803
This is much better.

00:30:24.886 --> 00:30:28.473
They should've put me
on this from the start.

00:30:38.316 --> 00:30:40.569
Come over here! I'll ring you up.

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:09.598
What?

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.062
I don't think the discount was applied.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:19.107
- What?
- Look, right here.

00:31:19.191 --> 00:31:21.151
You need to ring it up again.

00:31:22.861 --> 00:31:23.862
Jeez.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.745
CHECK RECEIPT, CHECK PRICE

00:31:34.998 --> 00:31:36.458
Cancel…

00:31:43.173 --> 00:31:46.927
Look, I don't know how to cancel this.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.095
- Can't we just let it slide?
- Excuse me?

00:31:49.179 --> 00:31:53.225
Also, I like being cashier,
so don't file a complaint.

00:31:53.308 --> 00:31:55.310
- Let's keep this between us.
- That's ridiculous--

00:31:55.393 --> 00:31:57.312
Just consider the 1,750 won as a donation.

00:31:59.648 --> 00:32:01.149
It'll bring you good luck.

00:32:18.959 --> 00:32:21.586
I knew it was going too smoothly.

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:23.380
Gosh, this is chaos.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.341
Maybe I should've just let them complain.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:30.345
Excuse me.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.598
A check?

00:32:35.141 --> 00:32:36.560
You don't have cash or a card?

00:32:36.643 --> 00:32:38.645
Why? Is there a problem?

00:32:40.564 --> 00:32:43.108
Just use a card.
I don't know how to process that.

00:32:43.191 --> 00:32:46.486
If you have a problem with that,
you should file a complaint.

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:48.113
- Excuse me?
- A complaint.

00:32:48.196 --> 00:32:49.906
Ma'am, let me help you with that.

00:32:52.242 --> 00:32:54.869
Just press this, and then this for checks.

00:32:54.953 --> 00:32:57.956
Get a signature on the back
and give her the change.

00:32:58.707 --> 00:33:00.667
Okay. Thanks.

00:33:04.379 --> 00:33:05.589
Sorry about that.

00:33:17.559 --> 00:33:18.977
You're not drinking, right?

00:33:19.811 --> 00:33:20.895
No.

00:33:26.651 --> 00:33:28.028
Gosh.

00:33:28.653 --> 00:33:31.740
Who drinks soju like it's water?

00:33:37.579 --> 00:33:39.080
What's going on?

00:33:40.498 --> 00:33:41.666
Hey, Si-yeol.

00:33:44.169 --> 00:33:45.170
We're done for.

00:33:46.421 --> 00:33:48.214
What do you mean?

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:52.552
I'm talking about our team, you punk.

00:33:52.636 --> 00:33:55.013
Come on, Coach.

00:33:55.847 --> 00:33:58.391
We're last in the fourth division.
We can't get any lower.

00:33:58.475 --> 00:34:01.269
How can we be "done for"?

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.813
I told you, I'll get us promoted.

00:34:03.897 --> 00:34:06.441
Promotion doesn't even matter.

00:34:08.526 --> 00:34:09.611
You know

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:12.947
the director who sponsors us, right?

00:34:13.657 --> 00:34:15.784
The director at my grandma's nursing home?

00:34:16.451 --> 00:34:17.369
Yes, him.

00:34:17.952 --> 00:34:19.329
Well, that director said

00:34:20.497 --> 00:34:23.249
he can't sponsor us anymore.

00:34:24.751 --> 00:34:25.710
What?

00:34:26.544 --> 00:34:29.255
A sponsorship contract isn't a joke.

00:34:29.339 --> 00:34:30.757
He can't just break it overnight.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.803
Well, what else can we do?

00:34:35.595 --> 00:34:39.307
Like you said,
we're in the fourth division.

00:34:40.058 --> 00:34:44.979
It's not exactly good publicity
to sponsor the last-place team.

00:34:45.063 --> 00:34:47.524
The director
was just sponsoring us for years

00:34:48.066 --> 00:34:52.153
as a service to the community
because he liked soccer.

00:34:52.904 --> 00:34:56.324
But he said he can't afford it anymore,
so there's nothing we can do.

00:35:02.497 --> 00:35:03.540
Then,

00:35:04.833 --> 00:35:06.084
what do we do now?

00:35:07.794 --> 00:35:09.546
What happens to the team?

00:35:09.629 --> 00:35:11.923
We have to find a new sponsor.

00:35:12.549 --> 00:35:14.050
It won't be easy, though.

00:35:15.301 --> 00:35:17.303
We're not going down like this.

00:35:17.387 --> 00:35:19.514
No, I mean

00:35:19.597 --> 00:35:21.725
what happens if we don't find one?

00:35:21.808 --> 00:35:23.476
What do you think, you punk?

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.480
The club goes bankrupt,
and the team disbands.

00:35:36.781 --> 00:35:38.450
Forget about paying the players.

00:35:40.535 --> 00:35:43.371
We can't even pay the rent
for the training ground.

00:35:44.497 --> 00:35:45.915
What can we do?

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.591
Don't tell the other guys, okay?

00:35:56.801 --> 00:35:58.928
I shouldn't have even told you.

00:36:00.513 --> 00:36:03.933
I just had to get it off my chest.

00:36:16.571 --> 00:36:18.323
I've been thinking.

00:36:19.532 --> 00:36:23.036
I don't think
you're a good fit for our store.

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:25.872
I'll pay you for your work today,

00:36:26.414 --> 00:36:28.249
but you don't need to come in anymore.

00:36:28.333 --> 00:36:30.126
Really? That's fine.

00:36:31.085 --> 00:36:34.923
The pay was too low
for the workload anyway.

00:36:42.138 --> 00:36:43.431
I'm sorry to bother you,

00:36:43.515 --> 00:36:45.725
but the totals aren't adding up.

00:36:46.559 --> 00:36:48.061
What?

00:36:48.144 --> 00:36:50.104
Ms. Kim's cash drawer is off.

00:37:10.542 --> 00:37:11.793
What did I just do?

00:37:12.418 --> 00:37:16.673
You gave the customer back
her 100,000-won check and the change.

00:37:17.799 --> 00:37:20.343
That explains
why we're exactly 100,000 won short.

00:37:21.052 --> 00:37:24.556
So, what happens to me?

00:37:24.639 --> 00:37:26.182
It's okay.

00:37:26.266 --> 00:37:29.853
Mistakes happen. Don't worry about it.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.563
Really?

00:37:32.981 --> 00:37:34.357
Of course.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.860
Just pay it back. No big deal.

00:37:37.735 --> 00:37:38.862
What?

00:37:38.945 --> 00:37:41.739
Your hourly pay is 10,030 won,

00:37:41.823 --> 00:37:45.201
and you worked for five hours,
so that's 50,150 won for today.

00:37:45.285 --> 00:37:48.329
But with the 100,000 won loss,

00:37:50.206 --> 00:37:53.543
you just owe us 49,850 won.

00:37:55.003 --> 00:37:56.170
Owe you?

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:01.676
You mean you're not even paying me,

00:38:01.759 --> 00:38:04.804
but I have to pay you 49,850 won?

00:38:04.888 --> 00:38:07.181
I worked like a dog
all day for this place!

00:38:07.849 --> 00:38:09.142
That's too bad.

00:38:13.146 --> 00:38:15.481
I walked here just to save bus fare!

00:38:16.274 --> 00:38:18.151
Can't you let this slide?

00:38:19.736 --> 00:38:22.572
I can't do that.
I'm just an employee here.

00:38:42.008 --> 00:38:45.219
I bragged about bringing home money.

00:38:45.303 --> 00:38:46.971
What do I tell Si-yeol?

00:38:47.972 --> 00:38:51.351
I can't say I worked all day
just to end up in debt.

00:38:55.563 --> 00:38:57.607
Should I sell the clothes?

00:39:11.079 --> 00:39:13.164
- Si-yeol, you're home!
- Yeah.

00:39:14.624 --> 00:39:16.542
- What's wrong?
- What?

00:39:17.293 --> 00:39:20.880
I mean, you went to training,
and you're back looking so dejected again.

00:39:21.422 --> 00:39:23.716
Well, that's…

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:31.182
It's nothing.
The team's just having some issues.

00:39:32.684 --> 00:39:35.144
Si-yeol, want me to cheer you up?

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:36.813
All of a sudden?

00:39:37.647 --> 00:39:39.399
Here. I made some money.

00:39:42.151 --> 00:39:45.530
Wow, it's pretty thick.

00:39:48.157 --> 00:39:51.536
- How much is this?
- It's 200,000 won. I did good, right?

00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:55.999
Wait, what did you do
to get 200,000 won in a day?

00:39:58.126 --> 00:40:00.044
You didn't steal this, did you?

00:40:01.963 --> 00:40:04.048
I'm on a mission
to do good deeds right now.

00:40:04.132 --> 00:40:07.593
How can you say that
to someone who's trying to live right?

00:40:07.677 --> 00:40:09.887
I know. You're right.

00:40:10.388 --> 00:40:12.140
But where did you earn this much in a--

00:40:12.223 --> 00:40:15.101
I've got skills.
I've been around the block, you know.

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:17.812
The details are a trade secret.

00:40:18.438 --> 00:40:21.315
You haven't eaten yet, right?
Let's go out. It's my treat.

00:40:26.029 --> 00:40:28.406
I told you to fix your doorbell already.

00:40:28.489 --> 00:40:30.783
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

00:40:31.451 --> 00:40:33.453
What are you guys doing here?

00:40:35.121 --> 00:40:38.207
Did you guys hear something?

00:40:39.083 --> 00:40:40.001
Hear what?

00:40:40.626 --> 00:40:42.795
The international match is today.

00:40:42.879 --> 00:40:44.130
We came to watch it together.

00:40:44.213 --> 00:40:45.840
Hello, Eun-ho.

00:41:03.983 --> 00:41:04.942
Hey!

00:41:11.407 --> 00:41:14.077
Eun-ho, you haven't tried
my family's galbi, right?

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.287
Jeong-bae's folks
bought a building selling this galbi.

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:17.455
It's good.

00:41:17.538 --> 00:41:19.957
Really? I haven't had beef galbi
in a while.

00:41:21.709 --> 00:41:24.962
Why couldn't you guys
just watch the game at home?

00:41:25.046 --> 00:41:27.048
Come on, don't be like that.

00:41:27.131 --> 00:41:29.801
We always watch
the international games here together.

00:41:30.343 --> 00:41:32.386
Aren't you glad we're here, Eun-ho?

00:41:33.721 --> 00:41:36.682
Of course. Beef galbi is always welcome.

00:41:37.767 --> 00:41:39.644
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

00:41:39.727 --> 00:41:42.396
How can you call yourself an athlete
when you're drinking this late?

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.816
Again with the nagging.

00:41:44.899 --> 00:41:47.318
You don't have to drink.

00:41:47.401 --> 00:41:51.364
Today's a good day,
so how about just one, okay?

00:41:52.115 --> 00:41:53.991
Would you like a glass, Eun-ho?

00:41:54.075 --> 00:41:55.243
Sure, pour me one.

00:41:58.871 --> 00:42:01.332
Okay, fine.

00:42:01.415 --> 00:42:04.293
What's the point of nagging
you guys anyway?

00:42:04.377 --> 00:42:05.586
Just don't overdo it.

00:42:06.337 --> 00:42:07.672
Okay!

00:42:07.755 --> 00:42:10.133
Nice seeing you again, Eun-ho.

00:42:10.216 --> 00:42:12.552
- Nice to see you!
- Cheers!

00:42:25.106 --> 00:42:27.316
You know, it's really weird.

00:42:28.151 --> 00:42:29.152
What is?

00:42:30.486 --> 00:42:32.905
Actually, since yesterday…

00:42:32.989 --> 00:42:35.992
Man, it's getting chilly.
I might catch a cold.

00:42:40.538 --> 00:42:42.623
They must've fixed the streetlight.

00:42:42.707 --> 00:42:44.250
It had been left broken for months.

00:42:50.756 --> 00:42:51.799
What the…

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.801
Who is it?

00:43:05.521 --> 00:43:06.981
You were stalked?

00:43:07.481 --> 00:43:09.692
Who'd stalk you?

00:43:09.775 --> 00:43:12.486
I know how crazy it sounds--

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:15.156
Beom, were you up all night gaming again?

00:43:15.239 --> 00:43:17.325
It's because you're tired, that's all.

00:43:17.408 --> 00:43:19.410
See? You've got dark circles
under your eyes.

00:43:19.493 --> 00:43:20.912
That's…

00:43:22.038 --> 00:43:24.040
just because I'm stressed out.

00:43:24.123 --> 00:43:26.167
Why are you stressed?

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:27.960
Bet his stocks tanked again.

00:43:28.044 --> 00:43:30.963
How's that my fault?
The domestic market is a total mess.

00:43:31.672 --> 00:43:35.509
I thought Si-yeol was the only one broke,
but you're penniless too, aren't you?

00:43:35.593 --> 00:43:38.095
Come on, I'm different from Si-yeol.

00:43:38.179 --> 00:43:39.805
He's all about soccer without a plan,

00:43:39.889 --> 00:43:43.100
and I ended up like this
trying to prepare for the future.

00:43:45.937 --> 00:43:47.063
What is it?

00:43:48.898 --> 00:43:50.399
What was that just now?

00:43:51.025 --> 00:43:54.320
Something flashed. Was it lightning?

00:43:54.946 --> 00:43:56.447
But the sky is clear.

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.373
Si-yeol.

00:44:06.207 --> 00:44:07.416
Come out for a second.

00:44:12.004 --> 00:44:14.799
What's the matter all of a sudden?

00:44:16.217 --> 00:44:19.136
Come out. How long are you going to hide?

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:20.638
What?

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:25.893
Hello, sis.

00:44:43.119 --> 00:44:45.496
- It's me, Secretary Choi.
- Come in.

00:44:55.506 --> 00:44:56.590
Hey.

00:44:56.674 --> 00:44:59.302
Congratulations on returning home, sir.

00:45:01.846 --> 00:45:05.850
Honestly, I've always hated this place
because my old man was here.

00:45:05.933 --> 00:45:07.393
It was more fun out there.

00:45:08.853 --> 00:45:12.982
But you know, after wandering around,

00:45:13.065 --> 00:45:14.442
there really is no place like home.

00:45:14.525 --> 00:45:17.945
After ten years,
it was even nice to see my father.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.740
Are you back for good now, sir?

00:45:24.368 --> 00:45:27.455
Of course. No need for me to run anymore.

00:45:28.789 --> 00:45:31.876
Anyway, what's that damn shaman up to?

00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:40.843
He's searching every
antique shop and bookstore in the country.

00:45:40.926 --> 00:45:42.845
Seems like he's looking for something.

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:48.059
He told me to wait and do nothing,
but what the hell is he doing?

00:45:48.142 --> 00:45:50.853
I need him to catch that other fox

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.939
so I can get on with my business, damn it.

00:45:54.648 --> 00:45:57.985
Also, the fourth-division soccer matter
is proceeding as you've requested.

00:45:58.069 --> 00:46:00.071
Oh, really?

00:46:00.738 --> 00:46:02.281
How are you proceeding with it?

00:46:04.283 --> 00:46:06.827
I found corruption and nepotism
at the sponsoring nursing home

00:46:06.911 --> 00:46:08.704
tied to its founding family.

00:46:08.788 --> 00:46:11.415
I told them to choose
between the whole family going to jail

00:46:11.499 --> 00:46:12.750
or ending the sponsorship.

00:46:13.376 --> 00:46:16.253
They should've announced
the termination of the sponsorship by now.

00:46:16.337 --> 00:46:17.630
Good job.

00:46:19.298 --> 00:46:21.509
How did you know I was here?

00:46:21.592 --> 00:46:24.178
That light earlier.
You gained spiritual power, didn't you?

00:46:25.679 --> 00:46:27.431
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:46:27.515 --> 00:46:29.934
Yes, I did.
I got a huge amount of spiritual power.

00:46:30.017 --> 00:46:33.687
A few more times like this,
and I'll have nine tails in no time.

00:46:33.771 --> 00:46:37.108
That old man, Chairman Kim, worked fast.

00:46:39.944 --> 00:46:42.696
Anyway, why were you hiding there?

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.199
You could've just said you were here.

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:47.743
Pardon?

00:46:48.327 --> 00:46:49.745
Was it because of the guys inside?

00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:51.872
Since when did she have that kind of tact?

00:46:51.956 --> 00:46:53.457
How long have you been there?

00:46:54.208 --> 00:46:56.836
Well, since the beginning?

00:46:59.964 --> 00:47:01.757
You're acting suspicious.

00:47:05.553 --> 00:47:06.554
Hold on.

00:47:08.055 --> 00:47:11.267
You weren't here for us, were you?

00:47:13.936 --> 00:47:17.481
Don't tell me you're the one
stalking that stock junkie?

00:47:33.456 --> 00:47:34.373
Yes.

00:47:35.374 --> 00:47:36.417
What?

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:43.507
Man, we're out of sauce.

00:47:44.216 --> 00:47:46.469
Our beef galbi is already seasoned.

00:47:46.552 --> 00:47:48.262
It tastes better just as it is.

00:47:49.138 --> 00:47:51.932
No, I like the sauce. I'll go buy some.

00:47:52.016 --> 00:47:53.559
Are you crazy?

00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:01.859
I should just eat it as is, right?

00:48:01.942 --> 00:48:04.195
I was wondering if we did something wrong,

00:48:04.278 --> 00:48:05.946
but I guess
it was Si-yeol who messed up.

00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:07.948
It's not good to get involved
in a couple's fight.

00:48:08.032 --> 00:48:09.867
Maybe we should've left earlier.

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:12.119
Well, it's not too late.

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:15.789
You want to go past them
while they're going at each other?

00:48:15.873 --> 00:48:17.666
I don't think that's a good idea.

00:48:18.459 --> 00:48:21.295
- We're totally trapped here.
- Yeah.

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:26.842
Just turn on the TV.
The match is about to start anyway.

00:48:26.926 --> 00:48:27.927
- Okay.
- Shall we?

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:29.053
Yeah.

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:30.804
Wait.

00:48:31.472 --> 00:48:33.182
Where did that go?

00:48:36.519 --> 00:48:37.520
"That"?

00:48:37.603 --> 00:48:40.189
You stupid eight-tailed fox.
Didn't I warn you about humans?

00:48:40.272 --> 00:48:42.566
Especially men, of all people?

00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:43.943
You didn't!

00:48:45.361 --> 00:48:46.737
- I didn't?
- No.

00:48:47.738 --> 00:48:49.365
I don't think you said that.

00:48:50.241 --> 00:48:52.201
Do I have to spell it out for you?

00:48:52.284 --> 00:48:54.578
How would I know if you didn't say it?

00:48:54.662 --> 00:48:56.288
Just wait a second!

00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:58.415
Please!

00:49:00.209 --> 00:49:01.669
Just calm down.

00:49:01.752 --> 00:49:03.379
Why should I?

00:49:04.046 --> 00:49:08.300
Come on, what is it?
Let's calmly talk about it.

00:49:08.384 --> 00:49:10.678
How does blowing up like that
help anything?

00:49:10.761 --> 00:49:15.015
You look exactly like her,
and you even act just like her.

00:49:16.308 --> 00:49:18.686
Listen to me carefully.

00:49:18.769 --> 00:49:20.563
I won't stop you from becoming human.

00:49:20.646 --> 00:49:21.897
But men?

00:49:21.981 --> 00:49:25.734
Do you know how many women
ruin their lives over men?

00:49:25.818 --> 00:49:28.946
- Especially naive girls like you.
- Hey.

00:49:29.029 --> 00:49:32.199
Girls like you
need to be extra careful around men.

00:49:32.283 --> 00:49:33.450
Then what about you?

00:49:34.952 --> 00:49:36.161
What?

00:49:36.245 --> 00:49:37.705
I saw everything.

00:49:37.788 --> 00:49:39.290
You held hands,

00:49:39.915 --> 00:49:42.167
and last night at Namsan…

00:49:42.251 --> 00:49:45.713
That's… different.

00:49:46.213 --> 00:49:47.214
How so?

00:49:47.298 --> 00:49:49.717
I'm going back to how I was, and this guy…

00:49:53.971 --> 00:49:55.347
is decent and great at soccer,

00:49:55.431 --> 00:49:58.309
despite how he looks now.

00:50:00.769 --> 00:50:02.021
But look at you.

00:50:02.104 --> 00:50:05.899
You barely know that guy,
so why are you stalking him?

00:50:05.983 --> 00:50:07.610
What do you even see in him?

00:50:07.693 --> 00:50:09.028
His face.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:11.655
Come again?

00:50:14.408 --> 00:50:15.784
He's good-looking.

00:50:17.703 --> 00:50:20.914
See? This is exactly why I'm worried.

00:50:21.624 --> 00:50:24.168
Do you think his looks
are going to pay the bills?

00:50:24.877 --> 00:50:28.339
Why are you so against this?

00:50:28.422 --> 00:50:31.925
Let her like him. She'll learn from it.

00:50:32.009 --> 00:50:34.511
You said he's broke, and she's clueless!

00:50:34.595 --> 00:50:37.973
He should at least have something
if he's going to take care of that idiot.

00:50:39.224 --> 00:50:41.977
Of all the men out there…

00:50:43.103 --> 00:50:45.272
Isn't there anyone else?

00:50:47.816 --> 00:50:50.527
Sorry to interrupt.

00:50:50.611 --> 00:50:52.863
Right. What about him?

00:50:52.946 --> 00:50:55.407
At least he isn't broke.

00:50:55.491 --> 00:50:56.700
What?

00:50:57.493 --> 00:50:59.745
Jeong-bae, what's up?

00:51:00.371 --> 00:51:05.000
Well, it's just that
we think you've been robbed.

00:51:06.502 --> 00:51:07.586
Robbed?

00:51:19.765 --> 00:51:20.641
Weird.

00:51:22.184 --> 00:51:23.602
Do thieves these days

00:51:24.561 --> 00:51:26.855
steal the AC off the wall?

00:51:26.939 --> 00:51:30.234
Jeez, that was the only thing
in this house worth any money.

00:51:30.317 --> 00:51:32.569
How did they know to take that?

00:51:32.653 --> 00:51:35.239
Si-yeol, is there
anything else you're missing?

00:51:36.115 --> 00:51:38.158
I don't know. Eun-ho.

00:51:39.368 --> 00:51:40.744
Are you missing anything?

00:51:41.912 --> 00:51:43.372
Just out of curiosity…

00:51:45.833 --> 00:51:48.210
did that thing double as a heater?

00:51:49.628 --> 00:51:51.088
No, not really.

00:51:51.171 --> 00:51:54.049
Right? That's a relief.

00:51:54.925 --> 00:51:56.510
What's with that reaction?

00:52:01.056 --> 00:52:02.808
So, about the AC,

00:52:03.434 --> 00:52:04.852
- I sold it.
- What?

00:52:05.477 --> 00:52:07.855
We won't be here in the summer anyway.

00:52:07.938 --> 00:52:09.815
It's winter and it's freezing.

00:52:09.898 --> 00:52:12.025
So it's not like we'll need AC, right?

00:52:12.901 --> 00:52:14.903
That's true.

00:52:15.529 --> 00:52:18.782
Good job. We're broke anyway.

00:52:18.866 --> 00:52:21.368
- So that's where the cash came from?
- Yeah.

00:52:21.452 --> 00:52:23.036
Oh, I see.

00:52:25.622 --> 00:52:27.875
I guess you sold it.

00:52:27.958 --> 00:52:29.918
Well, as long as you weren't robbed.

00:52:30.002 --> 00:52:31.712
- Yeah.
- Right.

00:52:31.795 --> 00:52:34.590
How much did you get for it, Eun-ho?

00:52:35.966 --> 00:52:39.762
- What?
- She gave me 200,000 won.

00:52:39.845 --> 00:52:40.929
- What?
- What?

00:52:41.013 --> 00:52:42.723
You sold it for 200,000 won?

00:52:42.806 --> 00:52:45.517
Why? Was it worth more?

00:52:45.601 --> 00:52:48.604
That was the latest model
he bought this summer.

00:52:49.229 --> 00:52:51.064
It's worth at least 400,000 won.

00:52:51.148 --> 00:52:52.691
At least 400,000?

00:52:52.775 --> 00:52:56.570
Wait. What about the outdoor unit?

00:52:57.362 --> 00:52:58.989
Did you sell that too?

00:52:59.072 --> 00:53:01.617
Yeah, because you don't need it
without the AC.

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.702
They said they'd get rid of it for me,

00:53:03.786 --> 00:53:05.579
even though
you usually have to pay for that.

00:53:05.662 --> 00:53:08.916
The outdoor unit alone
must be worth over 50,000 won.

00:53:09.583 --> 00:53:11.293
Maybe even 100,000 won.

00:53:12.252 --> 00:53:16.006
Did you say 100,000 won?
People sell those too?

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.676
Did I just get scammed?

00:53:45.994 --> 00:53:47.079
Hey, are you okay?

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:48.914
What?

00:53:48.997 --> 00:53:50.541
Why are you so tense?

00:53:50.624 --> 00:53:52.876
It's not your first time
on the national team.

00:53:54.545 --> 00:53:58.507
Right. Maybe it's because
I've always dreamed of this.

00:54:01.134 --> 00:54:02.970
But my heartbeat feels strange.

00:54:06.181 --> 00:54:07.808
What are you talking about?

00:54:07.891 --> 00:54:10.644
Don't be nervous. We got this.

00:54:13.355 --> 00:54:14.982
Jeez.

00:54:15.858 --> 00:54:19.444
Why is everyone drinking booze
like water in front of me today?

00:54:21.446 --> 00:54:24.575
If you're going to drink,
at least eat something with it. Okay?

00:54:25.117 --> 00:54:26.201
Here.

00:54:29.413 --> 00:54:33.458
Why are you so upset? These things happen.

00:54:33.542 --> 00:54:34.626
Si-yeol.

00:54:35.836 --> 00:54:38.255
Living as a human is just too hard.

00:54:38.881 --> 00:54:39.756
What?

00:54:48.056 --> 00:54:51.268
Are you crying? You should stop drinking.

00:54:52.102 --> 00:54:54.354
I was just trying to do things right.

00:54:55.355 --> 00:54:57.816
That's why I took the job at the store.

00:54:58.442 --> 00:55:02.863
But they worked me all day,
called me useless, and didn't pay me.

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:07.200
Then they told me to pay back 49,850 won.

00:55:08.035 --> 00:55:10.412
What? Which store was that?

00:55:10.495 --> 00:55:11.830
Are they insane?

00:55:12.706 --> 00:55:16.668
So I tried to fix it
by selling used stuff online,

00:55:17.586 --> 00:55:20.255
but I got scammed doing that too.

00:55:20.756 --> 00:55:23.675
I really can't live like this anymore.

00:55:23.759 --> 00:55:25.886
Come on, Eun-ho.

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:29.806
Eun-ho, it's okay.

00:55:32.059 --> 00:55:33.185
It's okay.

00:55:33.268 --> 00:55:36.647
You don't have to be here with me.
Go inside and watch the game.

00:55:37.606 --> 00:55:40.734
The international match starts soon,
doesn't it?

00:55:42.527 --> 00:55:44.112
What's the point of me watching that?

00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:49.159
I know Woo-seok is playing instead of me,

00:55:49.242 --> 00:55:52.204
but I don't exactly
want to watch it myself.

00:55:54.373 --> 00:55:57.876
It's hard for you too, right? I'm sorry.

00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:01.171
Eun-ho, I didn't say that to make you cry.

00:56:01.922 --> 00:56:02.923
Don't worry.

00:56:04.049 --> 00:56:09.137
I promise I'll get you back
to your old life, okay?

00:56:12.057 --> 00:56:13.558
I really promise.

00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:19.231
What?

00:56:21.108 --> 00:56:22.901
We're doing just fine.

00:56:23.819 --> 00:56:25.445
Let's not worry too much.

00:56:53.265 --> 00:56:54.891
Si-yeol!

00:56:54.975 --> 00:56:56.560
Something big happened!

00:56:56.643 --> 00:56:57.936
What happened?

00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:00.397
Hey, Si-yeol!

00:57:03.191 --> 00:57:04.192
Hyeon Woo-seok collapsed!

00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:05.986
What?

00:57:13.243 --> 00:57:15.203
He collapsed right before the match.

00:57:30.135 --> 00:57:31.803
- Woo-seok!
- Hey, Woo-seok!

00:57:31.887 --> 00:57:33.555
- Woo-seok!
- Coach!

00:57:33.638 --> 00:57:35.057
Apparently, it was cardiac arrest.

00:57:36.516 --> 00:57:38.852
They say he might die.

00:57:41.563 --> 00:57:42.564
What did you say?

00:57:49.196 --> 00:57:50.572
Woo-seok!

00:57:50.655 --> 00:57:52.491
Hey, wake up. Come on!

00:57:53.116 --> 00:57:54.326
Damn it!

00:57:59.456 --> 00:58:01.291
Over here!

00:58:10.467 --> 00:58:13.762
Eun-ho, what's happening right now?

00:58:14.304 --> 00:58:17.182
- Why is Woo-seok…
- I don't know.

00:58:17.682 --> 00:58:19.768
I just switched your fates. That's all.

00:58:20.393 --> 00:58:21.728
I'm not sure what's happening.

00:58:21.812 --> 00:58:22.729
Wait.

00:58:25.065 --> 00:58:28.902
Then, what just happened to Woo-seok

00:58:30.612 --> 00:58:33.198
was the fate that was meant for me?

00:58:36.701 --> 00:58:39.746
Am I the reason he ended up like this?

00:58:41.832 --> 00:58:46.002
Woo-seok might die instead of me?

00:58:51.591 --> 00:58:55.554
If that's true, what happens now?

00:58:57.389 --> 00:59:01.810
If you go back to normal,
can we reverse all this?

00:59:04.146 --> 00:59:05.230
I can't reverse it.

00:59:07.357 --> 00:59:08.316
What?

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.442
Charging 150 joules.

00:59:10.735 --> 00:59:12.696
One, two, clear!

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.907
Charging 200 joules. One, two, clear!

00:59:17.242 --> 00:59:18.952
I can't reverse it.

00:59:19.578 --> 00:59:22.122
If your friend dies in your place,

00:59:22.205 --> 00:59:25.417
there's nothing I can do,
even if I'm back to normal.

00:59:26.042 --> 00:59:28.461
There's no way for me to reverse your fate

00:59:28.545 --> 00:59:30.922
or to bring your friend back.

00:59:49.316 --> 00:59:51.234
{\an8}SPECIAL APPEARANCE BY HONG SU-HYEON

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.720
NO TAIL TO TELL

01:00:18.803 --> 01:00:23.308
{\an8}Did you think tampering with human fate
was a trivial matter?

01:00:23.391 --> 01:00:24.976
{\an8}Let's switch back now.

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:27.062
{\an8}It's not possible right now.

01:00:27.145 --> 01:00:29.314
{\an8}Why isn't it possible now?

01:00:29.397 --> 01:00:32.150
{\an8}You know it too, don't you?
That you're going to die soon.

01:00:32.234 --> 01:00:34.861
{\an8}I wouldn't sell this
for all the gold in the world.

01:00:34.945 --> 01:00:37.155
{\an8}- Who are you?
- I didn't expect to find

01:00:37.239 --> 01:00:39.574
{\an8}another one hiding in a place like this.

01:00:39.658 --> 01:00:43.245
{\an8}Fix this twisted fate
with your own two hands.

01:00:43.328 --> 01:00:46.039
{\an8}You want me to just die
instead of Si-yeol?

01:00:46.122 --> 01:00:48.291
So I need you to help me.

01:00:50.666 --> 01:00:52.671
