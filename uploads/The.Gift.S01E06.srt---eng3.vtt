WEBVTT

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.280
This is my father's study.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.280
And now,

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.440
Grandma has allowed me to use this room.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.920
Do you see anything?

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.440
Oh…

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.320
I feel strangely familiar with this room.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.520
What did you see?

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.840
This room used to be a nursery.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.440
As far as I can remember,
my father used to sit right here.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.200
Or did you see something more,
some kind of vision from the past?

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.040
No.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.480
This time it feels like

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.240
I have to touch something first

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.080
before I can connect to it.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.400
So let me try again.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.080
Do you see anything, Kluay?

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.760
I don't see anything.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.320
Maybe my mind isn't steady enough.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.880
Let me try one more time.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.240
Or…

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.760
did you see anything at all
that might help describe

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.640
what it was like?

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.440
In case I remember something
that can help you.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.440
Well, what I saw was

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.360
piles of children's toys.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.120
Small cots.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.360
And a mobile with animal shapes.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.200
And…

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.720
What is it, Kluay?

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.920
Children's toys?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.080
That's what I saw hanging in this room.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.280
You said you heard children's voices.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.120
How many children?

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.520
Um…

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.360
I saw children's toys.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.400
There was a wardrobe and baby cots.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.680
There were two baby cots.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.320
So there were two children in this room.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.120
No, Sin.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.720
Ouch.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.520
Aunt Nong. Aunt Nong, are you okay?

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.000
You know it's hot, and you were
still going to do that to him?

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.800
That cripple doesn't know anything.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.800
His leg has no feeling.
Why should you even care about him?

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.040
He may not feel it,

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.640
but his skin could blister
if it's hot water.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.920
Sin, why are you so cruel?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.320
Then why is he so obsessed with Warat?

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.200
If they love each other that much,

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.200
one day I'll tie them together

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.520
and let them die together.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.800
You're back, Jirasin?

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.520
Why do you ask?

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.760
I don't care about you.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.120
I just want to ask,

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.480
you met Warat, didn't you?

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.520
How was he? Is he doing well?

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.520
Did he ask about me?

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.640
Will he come here again?

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.040
Are you still asleep, Uncle?

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.640
That's why you're rambling nonsense.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.960
Wake up already.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.920
And remember this. No child

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.160
can ever make peace
with someone who killed their father.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.560
What are you talking about?

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.120
Wow, you still don't realize it,
Uncle Rut?

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.520
You're the one
who caused Warat's father to die.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.560
Sin!

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.920
I know you secretly went
to visit Mr. Wichan.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.720
And three days later,

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.560
he died.
If it wasn't you, then who did it?

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.880
I didn't do anything.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.880
I went to visit Wichan.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.160
You can fool everyone else.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.560
You can even fool yourself.
But you can't fool Warat.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.160
Stop dreaming foolish dreams

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.600
that he'll ever be good to you.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.799
And if you don't stop,
I'll be the one to tell him myself

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.039
that you killed his father.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.039
Sin!

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.120
Sin, come back here right now! Sin!

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.240
Sin, come back here!

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.880
-Sin!
-Mr. Rut.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.440
-Sin!
-Mr. Rut.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.760
Go after him. I'll slap his mouth shut!

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.880
Sin, you ungrateful bastard!

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.600
Come back here, Sin!

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.320
Look at him.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.280
Calm down.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.160
But is what Sin said true?

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.880
Why didn't I know anything about this?

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.720
When did you go see Mr. Wichan?

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.360
I'm Wichan's friend.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.480
I can visit him whenever I want.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.320
If you really didn't do
anything to Mr. Wichan,

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.680
then why are you afraid?

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.360
And besides,
Mr. Warat seems like a reasonable person.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.640
He wouldn't just believe Sin so easily.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.320
Tomorrow

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.200
I'm going to see Warat at Vanich Mall.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.360
If Sin keeps getting in the way like this,

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.880
maybe

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.280
I'll have to tell Warat the whole truth.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.680
Please calm down.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.000
Right now you're angry at Sin.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.920
And Sin himself

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.160
is trying to adjust to Mr. Warat.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.360
Once things settle,
everything will be better.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.960
You've waited this long already.
What's a little longer?

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.240
No.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.280
It's time

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.520
for Warat to know the truth.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.800
If those children really are
Ms. Mysterious's children,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.800
then that means Ms. Mysterious
and my dad had two children together.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.280
And your dad had to be separated
from Ms. Mysterious and the children.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.440
It might have made him miss them deeply,

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.240
so deeply that he turned
this room into his office.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.360
Have you ever thought that

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.920
one of those two children

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.760
might be me?

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.400
Um…

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.840
You're right. I forgot about that.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.600
Or maybe you didn't think of it

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.960
because you knew it was impossible.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.840
Oh, Mr. Warat.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.000
Hello.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.520
Is she here?

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.400
Yes.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.840
Ask her who my real parents are.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.600
Who is Ms. Mysterious to me?

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.760
Ask her. Go ahead.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.040
If I could communicate with her,
we would've known all of this long ago.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.840
Let go.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.520
Right?

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.640
But at least the fact that she appeared

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.920
means that the information I found
might actually be true, right?

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.480
What did she say?

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.040
She… she didn't answer at all.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.200
Every time she appears
or tries to communicate with me,

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.320
she never moves her lips.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.200
But Ms. Mysterious,

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.880
today you look very faint.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.800
Mr. Warat,

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.640
I think we should let
Ms. Mysterious go for now.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.800
She looks very weak.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.240
And what if she doesn't come back again?

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.280
I believe she will come back.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.400
Please. I feel sorry for her.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.840
Alright.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.160
I understand now
why Ms. Mysterious is losing strength.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.720
Ow.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.200
Grandma.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.680
What were you doing in that room?

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.000
Babe and I went in,

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.920
uh, to talk about some unfinished work.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.520
Yes.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.240
Warat was worried he wouldn't
be able to go to the office,

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.480
so he wanted to leave the work
with me to handle instead.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.960
No more questions, right?

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.000
I'm going to bed.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.160
Normally,

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.040
I don't let people go in
and out of that room very often.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.160
But since it's you, Warat,

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.160
I allowed it to be used as your office.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.920
I just didn't expect anyone else
to go in and use it as well.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.600
Grandma, Kluay is…

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.120
You don't need to keep repeating
what the two of you are.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.640
I myself

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.160
still need time to adjust.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.400
Let's take it step by step.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.080
That room contains many
of your father's personal belongings.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.600
Think carefully before you do anything.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.400
You've been staring at me
for quite a while.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.200
Oh.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.920
I have something I want to ask you,
Madam Chairwoman.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.120
You can call me Grandma, like Rat does.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.120
Thank you.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.360
I wanted to ask,
aside from praying in the prayer room,

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.680
do you worship
anything else in particular?

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.640
Like household spirits,

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.040
guardian deities, or anything like that?

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.000
You still haven't stopped
obsessing over things like this?

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.840
It's not like that.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.240
I just wanted to ask just in case.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.200
Let me warn you first.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.280
Do not even think about performing
any white magic or black magic here.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.560
If you do, I will deal with you.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.760
Because this place

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.040
contains only sacred
and auspicious things.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.240
Remember that.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.360
-Yes.
-Rat.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.880
Take good care of your girlfriend.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.320
Yes.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.000
Why didn't you talk to me first?

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.720
I just wanted to find a way

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.600
to see Ms. Mysterious as soon as possible.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.880
But she isn't an ordinary person.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.240
She's Mrs. Wanee Vanich.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.320
Ugh.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.080
Another day's gone.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.480
I will find a way
to help you as soon as possible.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.520
Det asked me to give you this.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.800
I don't want to read it.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:09.920
Hey, why not?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.680
I already took it.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.440
Oh, Mr. Warat, can you listen to me first?

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.720
Don't complain yet.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.640
I told you I just came
to run a quick errand.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.360
I'll be right back.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.800
I'm asking you for one last favor.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.280
After meeting you,
I'll have to fly to the US immediately.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.080
There's no plan to return to Thailand yet.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.760
Please come meet me one last time

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.000
if you still value our friendship.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.080
Det.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.760
Det.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.440
What are you doing?

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.640
Thank you, Det, for respecting me.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.440
I've thought about it,

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.040
and I really did go too far.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.800
How about this?

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.920
I'll call Kluay and tell her
that the letter was fake.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.960
Is that okay?

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.280
No need.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.960
If she goes and doesn't meet anyone,
she'll go back on her own.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.240
Oh.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.520
Aren't you afraid Kluay will be angry?

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.600
Going there
and not seeing anyone like that?

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.120
Det…

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.680
I'm sorry.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.920
I'm really sorry.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.440
Let's make up, okay?

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.880
Please.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.280
Hm?

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.080
Okay.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.160
Hey.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.600
Smile a little.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.720
Well,

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.560
that matter is over now.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.800
From now on,

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.120
there won't be any more trouble.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.760
I'm so happy.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.880
You've forgiven me.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.280
If that's the case, how about we go eat,

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.640
then watch a movie?

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.920
Or if you want to go shopping,
that's fine too.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.360
How does that sound?

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.000
No. I still have a lot of work.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.640
So you're still mad at me?

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.360
Alright, I'll go.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.960
You're the cutest.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.480
Then I'll go change clothes for a moment.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.080
This one.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.040
Let's go.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.880
You shameless bitch!

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.800
Ouch!

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.880
Hey, wait.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.440
We've never met before.
Why did you slap me?

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.120
You're meeting with someone's man here

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.520
and you're still asking?

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.280
Uh… someone's man?

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.280
Hey.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.720
Just looking at the photo,
you can tell it's not me.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.960
How could it not be? That's clearly you.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.680
Well, the face does look similar,

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.920
but…

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.200
That's not me, right?

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.360
Mistresses are all like this.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.520
Don't talk so much.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:00.960
Or do you wanna die?

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.440
Hey.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.720
That's not enough.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.120
Where are you…?

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.280
Where are you going?

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.680
Please, calm down.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.000
Hey!

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.640
Don't go after her.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.840
-Uh, sorry…
-Oops.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.440
We meet again, Kluay.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.640
Kluay.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.280
Why do you look like this, my friend?

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.520
You're soaked
like a puppy that fell into the water.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.520
Wow.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.560
Karma really sticks fast.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.400
Look at you,

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.760
soaked exactly like
what you did to me the other day.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.560
Did it really have to go this far?

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.640
Kluay, I'm sorry.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.640
-Let go.
-Ameena.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.440
This time, I'll let it go.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.400
But please, Det,

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.400
stay away from me
for the rest of your life.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.760
I never had a friend like you.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.680
Kluay.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.960
-Ouch, oh my!
-Oh!

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.960
-Som.
-Arnon.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.360
I was about to go look for you.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.680
I was coming to see you too.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.240
-So, have you seen this yet?
-Have you seen it?

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.480
Rat.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.360
Your girlfriend

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.720
hasn't even been in this house
for a full week

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.440
and something already happens.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.200
So what are you supposed to do next?

00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.920
Grandma, please calm down.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.400
Let's wait for her
to come back and explain.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.600
I'm sure something about this isn't right.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.960
There's no reason

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.800
for Kluay to be someone's mistress.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.560
If what you're saying is that

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.520
Kluay was framed and physically assaulted,

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.880
that's even worse.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.960
That means
this woman has a lot of enemies.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.280
And that means
you shouldn't continue with her.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.200
No.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.800
She's the only woman I'm going to be with.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.880
She's good enough for me.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.960
There she is. Perfect timing.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.120
Are you going to say it

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:39.760
or do I need to interrogate you
about what happened to you,

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.960
Boonsita?

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.200
I told you I don't know anything.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.080
Why won't you believe me?

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.240
No one is stupid enough to believe you.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.960
People put up with you
because they're tired of you.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.120
Try reflecting on yourself for once.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.640
Stop insulting me right now.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.880
I will stop because I'm not
coming back here ever again.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.000
If you want me to behave myself,

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.600
then just stay here

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.560
and cut ties with Kluay.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.640
That ends everything, Det.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.280
Ends it?

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.920
As long as you keep suspecting her and me,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.400
this will keep going in circles.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.280
You say I'm suspecting you,

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.240
but you only ever defend yourself.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.080
If you hadn't written that letter to her,

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.520
would this have happened?

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.880
Would it?

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.600
Where are you going?

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.440
I'm leaving.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.440
And don't threaten me with work,
with my dad,

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.480
or with money.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.560
I'm not letting you go anywhere.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.720
-It's over, Ameena.
-Det!

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.320
I told you not to go.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.960
I'm not letting you go.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.000
Det.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.000
I've been calling and messaging,
but I can't reach Kluay. What now?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.120
The one who leaked the clip of Kluay being
slapped and accused of being a mistress,

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.360
I'll make sure they learn their lesson.
This is a criminal case.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.760
But Arnon, you know, right,

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.960
that right now Kluay is staying
at the Vanich house as Warat's girlfriend.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.120
If the Chairwoman sees this clip…

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.160
this will destroy
both Kluay and Mr. Warat.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.440
Then we need to get that clip taken down
as fast as possible.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.760
Right.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.080
I have contacts at the unit that handles
fake news for our mall quite often.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.600
Call them. What are you waiting for?

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.640
Yes.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.840
If you say you never knew
each other before,

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.600
and she assaulted you,

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.360
why didn't you file a police report?

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:43.280
I'm afraid it would damage Vanich.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.920
With the utmost respect, ma'am,

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.360
there are comments saying that Ms. Kluay

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.160
is the future daughter-in-law of Vanich.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.600
Satisfied now?

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.920
Grandma. Please stop.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.360
Let Kluay go shower and clean up first.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.280
Interrogating her now won't help anything.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.840
Besides, Arnon
is already handling the legal side.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.400
Please, stop.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.520
Kluay.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.800
Let's go.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.080
With the utmost respect, ma'am,

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.920
this is footage from the CCTV.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.080
Ameena?

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.560
What was she doing there?

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.960
Was this Ameena's doing?

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.520
I believe so, ma'am.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.600
The two of them have had bad blood
since their school days.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.720
Ms. Ameena has been following
and provoking Ms. Kluay ever since.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.760
Do not let Rat know about this
under any circumstances.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.400
No matter what kind of person she is,

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.760
Ameena is more suitable for Rat.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.520
Yes, ma'am.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.160
Who says family background doesn't matter?

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.680
No matter what,

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.880
my Rat must have
a woman who is fully qualified

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.000
in every way.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.280
Most importantly,

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.960
I don't want history to repeat itself
like with Wichan and…

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.400
Ma'am, be careful.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.080
What is this?

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.080
BOONYAVEJ HOSPITAL

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.080
GET WELL SOON

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.800
The doctor said you're fine.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.880
Once this IV bag is finished,

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.720
you can go home if you want.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.680
Det, look.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.360
So many people are worried about me.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.640
I can't even reply to all the messages.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.360
You shouldn't post photos
of yourself getting an IV

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.760
on social media.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.880
It's private.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.840
This is exactly the kind of thing
you should post.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.480
Everyone's worried about me.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.080
If I don't tell them,
they'll be upset with me.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.040
Na…

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.360
Well…

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.240
Well…

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.200
I have something I want to tell you.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.280
But…

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Det.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.560
Thank you, Det.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.280
You've always been good to me.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.120
You know,

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.280
I was even thinking,

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.960
if you hadn't helped me,

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.440
by now I might've…

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.920
Thank you so much, Det.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.520
So this is the future
Vanich daughter-in-law?

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.000
I don't know how Mr. Rat
could pick her to be his girlfriend.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.800
Their backgrounds are worlds apart.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.160
There's even a scandal clip
about stealing someone else's man.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.160
They suit each other perfectly,
don't they?

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.520
His mother was a mistress,

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.680
and he deserves

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.920
to get this kind of woman.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.800
Didn't you say you'd never let Kluay

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.920
become a Vanich daughter-in-law?

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
And who said

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.600
that every woman who dates Warat

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.160
gets to become a Vanich daughter-in-law?

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.920
Warat will never get his hands

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.200
on a single baht of Vanich money.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.720
No matter how much they love each other.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.120
Kluay will never live comfortably.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.720
I promised my sister.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.640
And that's exactly how it will be.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.240
What's wrong, Lak? Why are you crying?

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.800
I'm scared, Sin.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.720
I don't want to die yet.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.280
What was that? How could
you die? Why would you say that?

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.480
Did anyone do anything to you?
Tell me who did this to you?

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.280
Kluay.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.560
Kluay, your friend?

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.920
Kluay said I'm going to die.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.040
Lak, what did she say?

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.240
Stop hanging out with people like that.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.840
But this time, Kluay was serious, Sin.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.120
I'm scared. I don't want to die yet.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.880
You won't die, Lak. There's no way.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.880
I don't want to die.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.400
You're a friend of the deceased, right?

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.800
Sin.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.640
Miss.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.560
RESTRICTED AREA

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.240
May I have your name, please?

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.240
Please answer me.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.560
PATHUMTHANI RESCUE TEAM

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.000
Lak.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.360
-Please.
-Lak.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.640
Please answer me.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.080
Lak.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.840
-Sin.
-Sin.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.760
Lak.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:26.880
Hold him back.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.480
-Kluay.
-Sin.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.600
Why is Lak like this, Kluay?

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.520
Why is she like this?

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.160
Sin.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.200
You killed my sister!
Why did you kill my sister?!

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.760
-Why did you kill my sister?!
-Sin.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.080
-Officer!
-Arrest her. She killed my sister.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.560
Arrest her. She killed my sister.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.800
Arrest her.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.600
-She killed my sister!
-Calm down, sir. Please calm down.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.400
Arrest her.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.760
She killed my sister.
Why are you holding me back?

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.560
She killed my sister!

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.360
The law never did anything to her.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.440
So I had to deal with her myself.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.600
She looks so harmless.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.400
How can she be this cruel?

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.320
She deserves worse
than what she did to Lak.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.080
It's almost time.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.800
Her time is almost up.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.360
Mr. Sin.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.280
What is it?

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.400
You have a visitor asking to see you.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.560
Uncle Rut, why are you here?

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.080
Why didn't you tell me first?

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.280
I didn't come to see you.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.280
I know you're busy.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.000
I came to see Warat.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.600
But he's not here.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.200
He's sick.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.080
Are you afraid of something?

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.680
Afraid I'll tell him the secret?

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.160
That's why you rushed here first?

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.600
Can't you speak nicely
to your uncle just once?

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.640
Huh?

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.160
But fine.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.880
I won't hold it against you.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.720
Because someone like you

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.240
doesn't know the truth.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.600
I ask only one thing.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.360
Don't speak

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.280
badly about Warat.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.440
He has nothing to do with this.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.520
Since Warat

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.400
is the son of Praewilai,

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.960
the woman who destroyed my family.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.360
That's the past.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.320
The past is the past.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.640
Come on.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.720
I understand you.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.720
But you need to separate things.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.480
All you see is benefits.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.200
Don't you think?

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.520
Of course,

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.000
I think about it.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.800
But I'm not obsessed
with just one thing like you.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.280
What I want most in life

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.320
is the downfall of the Vanich family.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.200
And if I don't let you do that?

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.920
In the past,

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.280
your words might have scared me.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.800
You know

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.120
why I came here today, right?

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.520
What I'm going to tell Rat.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.280
Go on. Say it.

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.600
I'd like to hear

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.800
how you're going to cover up
his father's death.

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.040
No.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.640
No.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.160
That's not it.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.240
Uncle.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.520
Uncle Rut. Uncle Rut.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:34:00.400
SIN

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.960
So what?

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.400
Why don't you sound shocked at all?

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.040
Or did someone already call you?

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.960
Why should I be shocked?

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.920
Uncle Rut is always unwell.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.239
He goes out all the time.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:22.000
Every time he comes back,
he collapses like this.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.600
But this isn't at home.

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:26.639
He collapsed in the office.
What if it were somewhere else?

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.239
Then what?

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:32.400
I'd go take care of him.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.159
Go back to work, Sin.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.960
And tell Uncle Rut

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.320
I'll pick him up myself.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.520
I'm making the soup he likes.

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:48.400
As soon as it's done, I'll go get him.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.040
You just ate it this morning.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.520
You want it again already?

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.520
If I'd known it would be
this uncomfortable

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.760
and itchy,

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.720
I would've found another way.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:23.120
Hey.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.640
The door's locked properly, right?

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.280
All set.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.600
-Come on, I'll help unwrap it.
-Hey.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.720
No, maybe not.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.440
I'm not used to this.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.280
It's too personal.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.800
If you're not used to it,
you have to get used to it.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.000
Come on.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.240
Ow.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.840
Keep it down.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:43.840
Does it hurt?

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.080
Wow.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.280
Hey.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.000
You don't mind my foot at all?

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.040
Foot, hand, arm, leg…

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.040
-Ow.
-They're all body parts.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:04.760
That's a strange thing to ask.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.760
-Oh.
-Ouch.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.680
You're not really hurt.

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.960
Scratch it for me too.
We're already this far.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.400
It's so itchy.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.400
Go on, scratch until you're satisfied.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.880
You won't even scratch it for me?

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.640
I'm starting to get used to it now.
Feels kinda nice.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.000
Ow, that hurts.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.840
Stop fooling around already.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.960
We've wasted enough time today.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.560
I should apologize to you too.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.040
I'm not that heartless, you know.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.880
If Ameena really set you up to get hurt,

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.520
I'll go after her for real.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.920
Thank you.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.600
But you don't have to do anything.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.840
Just let Ameena think she's won.
That's fine.

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.120
You may not do anything, but I will.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.720
So she won't hurt you again.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.440
So you can keep working for me.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.480
If something happens to you, I lose out.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.200
-Clear?
-So,

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.360
you're worried about yourself.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.720
Of course I am.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.040
You think I'm worried about you?

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.880
Let's get back to business.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.480
Today I'll follow up on the blueprints,
the original house plans, with Mr. Arnon.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.560
I want to see
the original layout of this place.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.520
That's going to be very detailed.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.280
No matter how hard it is, I have to do it.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.200
I feel sorry for Ms. Mysterious.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.120
And I feel sorry for myself too.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.840
Oh? What about me?

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.640
It's Mr. Arnon,

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.280
He should've gotten the blueprints by now.

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.800
The house registration.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.320
The address of this place.

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.600
How did Arnon get this?

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.080
Why are you wearing a cast?

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:06.680
That's my business.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.040
Now this. This is really your business.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.280
The house registration
of the Vanich house.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.200
It's the oldest.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.120
It took a lot of effort to get this.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.040
HOUSE REGISTRATION

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:21.800
Grandma Aom.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.320
Listed as a resident.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.560
Who's that?

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.800
Judging from her date of birth,

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.200
she must be quite old.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.040
Or maybe she's already passed away.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.200
-What?
-No.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.200
There's a record of relocation.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.040
I checked with the destination office,

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.080
Grandma Aom is still alive.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.520
Is there really no way we can
just ask Grandma directly?

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.120
Like seeing snow in Thailand.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.640
-Huh?
-Thick snow.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.480
Okay.

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.320
Then let's go right now.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.320
To Grandma Aom's new house.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.000
We already have the address,
and Mr. Arnon checked

00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:58.960
that it's a real, right?

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.360
It's in Ayutthaya.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.560
I thought it'd be Bangkok.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:07.040
But a round trip to Ayutthaya
won't take long. It's close.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.640
No way.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.960
You're going to drag me along
in this condition?

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.240
I don't want to take the cast off.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.840
Ugh, fine. I'll drive. Okay?

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.880
Huh?

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.880
I want Mr. Arnon to help investigate

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.480
Kluay's past.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.880
Dad died

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.200
because of things like this.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.600
I don't want it to happen again.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.040
The day Warat gets everything
from Vanich Mall,

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.160
that day will be ours.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.800
NEXT EPISODE

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.120
Huh?

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.800
Let's just stay out of each other's lives.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.200
He's my husband.

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.280
