Your Highness,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.870
His Majesty prepared these clothes
beforehand

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.430

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.690

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.590

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.620
Your Highness,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.590

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.210
I'm not leaving.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.680
We'll return to the palace
at the crack of dawn.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.630
By His Majesty's decree,

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.100
if Your Highness asks to return,

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.900
we can use our lives as leverage.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.360
He knows I won't take an innocent life,

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.710
so he devised this tactic for me.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.520
Fine.

Upon departure,

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.970
His Majesty left me with this letter

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.400
and asked me to give it to Your Highness
after we escaped danger.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.310
But now I'm taking the liberty
to present it

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.370
ahead of schedule.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.930

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.940
To my dear wife Wanyin:

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.110
My real name is Zhang San.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.360
Laugh if you want.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.160
In the past, I was often asked

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.520
why my parents gave me

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.610
such an unremarkable name.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.190
But the reality was quite the opposite.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.110
From elementary to middle school,

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.750
I was always the first student

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.960
whose name was remembered by the teachers.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.560
[Zhang San]

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.190
However,

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.530
except for this unusual name,

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.340
everything about me

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.960
actually seemed lackluster.

[SOS]

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.340
I was only an average student.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.850
At this point, you might start wondering

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.430
why I keep talking about my time
in junior high school.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.690
That's because my life

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.790
in the world we're from ended there.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.050
In ninth grade,

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.920
when I was fiddling with my phone
in class,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.240
ia pop-up add

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.590
sucked me into this book.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.430
It has been 16 years and 8 months
since then.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.019
Come to think of it,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.240
I've been playing the role of Xiahou Dan

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.930
for a longer time
than I spent on being Zhang San.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.480
Long live Your Majesty!

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.000
In the past two years,

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.560
sometimes a doubt would cross my mind—

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.680
did that world outside the book

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.680
truly exist,

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.250
or was it just an illusion
created within my sick brain?

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.570
You know what's funny?

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.680
When I first arrived,

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.830
I felt like I was trapped

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.490
in a never-ending nightmare.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.530
But now in retrospect,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.630
I can barely recall the name

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.030
of my junior high school.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.409
It all changed when you asked,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.600
"How

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.870

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.070
I finally realized my past was true,

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.830
and that I had

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.510
had a real life.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.930
I once had parents,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.390

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.190
and a future.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.890
I'm such a despicable man.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.520
You saved me at that very moment,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.180
yet in the next second,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.650
I devised a plan to deceive you,

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.780
to gain your trust,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.090
to become your ally,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.850
and to use your knowledge of the script

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.100
for my own benefit.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.360
Only through that

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.620
could I achieve victory in the surest way

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.570
and retaliate on the Empress Dowager

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.920
and Prince Duan.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.310

In front of you,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.680
I've not only glossed over my past,

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.430
but also carefully watched
my manners and speech,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.870
trying to act like

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.000
a modern person you're familiar with.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.550
So what if you're the Emperor?

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.210
Can you protect her from harm?

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.650
That I can do.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.070
Then can you guarantee

that among all the women in the world,
she'll be the only one you want?

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.430
That's also easy.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.240
As Zhang San,

Your Highness,

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.360
Chu Si scouted the gate tower at night

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.960
and found the Imperial Guards
to be led by Prince Duan's men.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.390
Now,

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.280
the city gate is surrounded
by border troops.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.430
As for where we should go,

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.840
it's up to Your Highness.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.260
How are your injuries?

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.090
These minor wounds

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.330
amount to nothing.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.600
Let's leave the mountain

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.320
for an inhabited area.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.190
Or we can't receive news
about the capital.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.030
I'm here to protect Your Highness
by imperial order.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.510
There are many uncertainties now.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.030
The troops from three border regions
arranged by Prince Duan

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.270
are closing in on this place

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.440
to suppress the Imperial Guards

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.040
and help him take the throne.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:15.490
These troops

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.490
are coming from the north, east and south.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.240
I suggest

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.100
we find a way out

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.840
before they join forces.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.840
Let's head south.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.070
Your Highness,

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.470
the Right Army is coming from the south.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.440
We'll head south

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:29.740
to Peiyang.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.930
That's what His Majesty wants.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.250
Clothes were prepared beforehand, right?

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:38.110
Put them on now.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.870
Then we'll set out.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:40.200
Yes.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:40.510
Yes.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:33.390
Sir,

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.470
did you sell fish in town today?

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:36.190
Yes.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.630
The business wasn't good,

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.760
so I came back early.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.510
Ma'am,

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.070
is your husband home?

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:42.750
Yes, he is.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.480
There's a huge manhunt in town now.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.200
It's said to be complete chaos.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.400
How weird and creepy.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.340
Why would so many people die
during the Empress Dowager's funeral?

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.670
Could it be possible that Her Majesty

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.990
tried to take people with her

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.240
to the nether world
so she could have servants there?

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.370
But as I heard, it was

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.870
the demonic consort
who murdered the Empress Dowager

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:01.750
and planned to kill

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.240
the Emperor too during the funeral.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.280
Is that true?

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.670
There are wanted posters for her
at the city gate now.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.600
-Really?
-It can't be fake, can it?

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.680
Excuse me.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.910
My sisters and I are heading
to the capital to meet our kin.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.040
We just overheard your conversation.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.490
Is it safe to go

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.730
to the capital now?

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.260
At a time like this,

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.000
even a strong male like me

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.530
dare not enter the capital.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.940
Young ladies, I suggest

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.500
you make a second plan.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.600
Right now, entry to the capital

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.330
is allowed, but exit is denied.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.960
My husband went there to sell fish
early in the day,

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.870
and is still trapped within till now.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.730
But this gentleman here just said

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.340
the manhunt was for the demonic consort.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:44.390
Why are even males

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.240
forbidden to leave the capital now?

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:49.150
Who knows?

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.130
Come on. Let's go home.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:58.720
Could it be

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.270
that Xiahou Dan has escaped?

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:16.870
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness!

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:17.200
Your Highness!

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.130
Are you alright?

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.780
You're burning up.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.410
We can't go any further.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.480
Her Highness needs to take a rest
somewhere.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.630
I'll check out on that house.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:26.160
Don't.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.620
Commoners dread strange men most.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.610
And there are so many of us.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.270
Chu Wu, you do it instead.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:33.310
The two of you,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.860
go hide somewhere.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.910
Take care of Her Highness.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:39.240
Sure.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.370
Let's go.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:52.840
Sir,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.270
we plan to visit our relatives
in the capital.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.200
Yet our money was stolen on the way.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.220
Now, the lady of our house is sick.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.890
This is all the money we have on us.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.050
Could you kindly give us some food?

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.730
We're all suffering souls.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.140
Come on in.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:10.320
Let's go.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.200
Thank you.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:28.090
Why is your wife...

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.800
burning that?

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.800
To mourn her brother
who lived near Mount Bei.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:34.870
Yesterday,

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.910
while he was taking a peek

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.080
at the Empress Dowager's funeral,

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.580
unexpectedly,

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.850
Prince Duan rose in a rebellion

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.770
and caused many deaths.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.050
My wife's brother somehow lost his life.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.580
Prince Duan started a rebellion?

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.080
Was it a success?

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:52.750
W-We...

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:54.550
have no idea at all.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.790
He who delivered the bad news to us

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.320
just said many people died,

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.550
most of which were Imperial Guards.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.720
He didn't know much other than that.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.770
The dead were mostly Imperial Guards.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.609
There was either an internal fight
within them,

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:10.740
or that Prince Duan veiled his armies.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.740
In either case,

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.420
CEO Dan must've got in grave danger.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:14.880
My Lady.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:15.750
Sir,

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.270
we shouldn't bother you
at a time like this,

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.920
but the lady of our house is severely ill.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.440
Could you make her a bowl of noodles?

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.240
Wait a moment.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.030
My love,

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.740
make some noodles now.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.210
Let's go.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:40.440
Here you are.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.500
Have some noodles.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:42.760
Thank you.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.400
Take it.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.030
Thanks.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.450
Your Highness,

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.010
at least have a bite.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.920
A long journey awaits us.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.720
That's right.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.590
Travel takes physical strength.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:00.850
Please eat something.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.000
You're right.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.440
I can't fall now.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.810
He's still waiting for me.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.170
You should eat too.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.030
Yes.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.740
Alright, stop crying.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.480
It's bad for your eyes.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.070
I just pity my unfortunate brother.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.630
That heinous Prince Duan
is beneath contempt!

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.440
Keep it down.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.000
First,
the Emperor killed the Empress Dowager.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.200
Then, Prince Duan rebelled
and tried to kill the Emperor.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.010
These...

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.300
are all royal affairs.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.110
How could we have foreseen those?

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.640
It's true I don't know much,

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.520
but my brother

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.310
told me...

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.270
that the Emperor ordered
equal land distribution

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.330
and tax reduction.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.340
His Majesty also executed
many corrupt officials!

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.110
Isn't it enough to put
these corrupt officials in jail?

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.110
Why execute them?

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.240
If I am to have the people's support,

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.250
I must first give them hope.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.730
Execution is a just desert

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.700
for these vile officials.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.970
It gives hope to the people.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:17.510
Back then,

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.650
I thought he was just acting over the top.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:21.960
Little did I imagine

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.180
that after living for 16 years
in this world,

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.100
he had already seen
the harsh truths of life.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.570
Sacrificing one person

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.840
to ensure others' survival

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.590
is sometimes unavoidable.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.550
Don't you forget

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.600
they are 2D characters.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.730
I would also remind myself

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.200
not to get too emotionally involved.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.240
Do you really think you are a tyrant?

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.720
I am a tyrant,

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.980
as I have always been.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.550
But the man who claimed to be a tyrant

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.370
and to have no regard for others' lives

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.440
is actually spending what little

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.590
time and life he has

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.350
to protect

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.410
all those irrelevant 2D characters.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.500
Your Highness,

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.240
don't cry.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.750
What's with this lady?

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.410
Perhaps she's missing
her family in the capital.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.000
Life hasn't treated us well.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.110
Dear,

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.320
let me get you some more soup.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.970
You won't feel homesick on a full stomach.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.240
Thank you, ma'am.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:40.880
But I can't eat anymore.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.780
Why is your face so red?

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:48.960
She's running a high fever.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.680
We need to get her a physician now.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.350
Honey!

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:52.120
I'm fine.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.800
I'm just tired from the journey.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.630
Could we stay here for the night?

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.100
We don't mean to turn you down,

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.980
but the authorities have issued a notice

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.550
forbidding residents
from housing strangers

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:08.270
overnight.

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:11.070
Although you're not bad people,

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.790
ladies,

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.220
we common folks

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.570
dare not go against the authorities.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.840
How about...

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:21.550
In that case,

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.030
we'll take our leave.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.340
Thank you for the noodles.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.520
Thank you.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:47.070
That...

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.000
What's going on?

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:48.490
This...

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.140
Well...

00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.660
Quiet down!

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.970
My Lady,

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.560
she was just climbing
through the kitchen window

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.090
when I caught her in the act.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:06.170
Sir, ma'am,

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:08.790
take a look. Are these your belongings?

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.610
We saved this meat for the New Year.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:17.420
And that hairpin...

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:18.790
It seems to be Wang's.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:19.880
Right.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.650
Easy on her, Chu Wu.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.610
She's just a kid.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.350
Yes.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.160
Sir, ma'am,

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:32.740
we bid you farewell.

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:34.030
This thief is yours

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:34.760
to deal with.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:36.640
Miss,

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.760
I wanted to say this earlier,

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.010
but this old fool stopped me.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.750
The authorities did issue a notice.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.550
But our village is quite remote,

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.050
with the nearest inn

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.640
situated over 30 li away.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.830
It's not safe for you three ladies

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:50.920
to stay out there.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.480
Yes.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.360
Things have taken a turn.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.550
They caught a thief for us.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.460
Ladies, if you don't mind,

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.650
please stay here for the night.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.440
You may leave tomorrow morning.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.070
Yes.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.080
Good idea.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:06.590
Thank you.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.080
Come on. Get in the house.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.000
Get up!

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.920
Move.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:31.690
Your Highness.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.100
Your Highness?

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.270
When I escorted the thief to the woodshed,

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:39.480
she struggled too hard

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.610
and made much noise,

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.300
drawing some villagers over.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.720
Our host returned the lost items
to his neighbors.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.920
Now, about five to six households

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.120
are aware of our stay.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:51.690
Your Highness,

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.000
if we kill all those people
under the cover of darkness,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.530
we can frame the thief for it

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.380
and then cover our tracks.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:57.880
No.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:23:59.930
Let's go.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.130
We should leave

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:02.520
for Peiyang now.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.210
Your Highness,

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.200
you're in no condition to go anywhere.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.800
You need a good night's rest.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.400
Chu Yi and Chu Si are keeping watch
on the roof.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.460
We don't have to run

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.150
until anyone reports us.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:16.480
Fine.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.340
I'll sleep a bit more then.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.240
Wake me up in four hours.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.240
Yes, Your Highness.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:29.670
We found him!

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.790
We found him,

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:36.450
Centurion.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:37.800
Let me see.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.830
It really is him.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.030
Shall we notify the Imperial Guards?

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.290
Are you stupid or what?

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.200
He was caught by us, the Central Army.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.350
Bring a few men with you

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:51.070
and escort him to His Highness.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.350
Yes!

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.070
Take him away!

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.330
Yes!

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:54.490
Move!

00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:59.070
CEO Dan,

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.060
wait for me.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.440
I'll be with you soon.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.170
Your Highness.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.300
Your Highness!

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.970
Your Highness.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:10.610
Your Highness,

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.480
there are soldiers here now.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:15.810
Search carefully!

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:17.000
Move!

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:18.440
-Officer, are you mistaken?
-Darn it!

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.100
Officer...

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.900
They got to this place so soon.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.050
Move!

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:26.830
Cut the crap. Get a move on!

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:27.480
Be quick!

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.790
Search the house!

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:29.520
Confess now!

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.550
I don't know anything.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.830
-Walk faster!
-Report the household
with suspicious lodgers

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:35.560
immdiately!

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:37.440
The reward is10 tales of silver!

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:37.750
Officer!

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.070
Your Highness!

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:39.720
-We're innocent!
-Your Highness!

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.030
Move!

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:41.290
Use the rear door here.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.880
Let's go.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:42.730
Go there!

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:44.940
And you!

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.040
-Hold on.
-Move!

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.450
Quickly!

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:53.550
Confess now!

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:57.720
There are soldiers here.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.590
Run for your life.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.920
Don't steal again.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:05.770
This way.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.590
Check over there!

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:08.920
Go!

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:13.830
Open the door!

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:14.620
Open up!

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:15.720
Who is it?

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.520
Open the door!

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:18.880
Now!

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:22.940
Search!

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.370
Nobody's here.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:30.320
Where is she?

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.520
Did you tip her off and let her go?

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.620
Officer, we're innocent.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.030
Officer,

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:37.830
we don't know who she really is.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.050
She only asked to spend the night here.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.640
-Officer, please spare our lives.
-Don't hurt us.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.170
Guys, go!

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.400
Split up and search the village.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:44.930
Go, guys!

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.550
Hurry!

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:52.480
This way.

00:26:59.030 --> 00:26:59.890
It's a dead end.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:01.790
We need to first find an anchor up there

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:03.850
and pull Your Highness up with a rope.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.240
It's too late.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:07.560
The soldiers will be here soon.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.640
Besides,

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:10.610
how are we supposed

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.320
to find a long rope right now?

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:14.110
We'll lure the soldiers away

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.590
to buy you as much time as possible.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:16.000
No.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.220
You escaped by the skin of your teeth.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.280
Going back

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:22.970
is no different than suicide.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:26.290
Only I am their target.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.640
You should leave.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.240
I can't drag you down with me.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.240
Your Highness...

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:30.930
Just leave.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.310
Don't worry, Your Highness.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.480
We'll use the trees for cover,

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.640
take out some soldiers,

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.030
and kill ourselves before capture.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:37.760
We'll make sure no clue is left.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:40.080
Exactly.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.480
Chu Wu, Chu Qi,

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.450
think of a way

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.850
to help Her Highness out of danger.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:46.880
Wait.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:49.910
What are your names?

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.330
We don't have names.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.720
"Chu Yi" and "Chu Si" sound good enough.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.180
Take care, Your Highness.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.500
Do come back alive!

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.860
Your Highness,

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.200
death is almost certain.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.640
Might as well take a gamble.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.750
Chu Qi, stay alert.

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:04.700
I'll go find an anchor up there.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:11.650
Your Highness,

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:13.430
let's take a rest over there.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.200
I've been a liability to you all.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.470
Don't beat yourself up, Your Highness.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.410
Who's there?

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:56.650
Your Highness,

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.160
that hole's too small

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.690
to fit more than two people.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:01.550
If she tries to harm you, I won't be able

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:02.750
to rescue you in time.

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:06.050
She could've reported me for the reward,

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:08.130
yet she risked coming back for me.

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:10.010
I trust her.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.880
You have great lightness skills.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.340
Hide on the cliff face now.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.000
Be careful.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:15.400
Got it.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.560
I saw them heading to the woods.

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.080
Should we keep looking?

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.530
Of course we should.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.830
If we catch her,
we'll receive a thousand taels of silver

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:44.890
and be set for life.

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:48.040
That woman's quite good at hiding.

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:50.400
How many villages have we searched?

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.640
I don't even get to enjoy the New Year.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.570
Don't be afraid.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.550
That's why she's called a demonic consort.

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:56.510
The higher-ups

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:57.550
told us to catch her,

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:58.680
be she alive or dead.

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.510
If she falls into our hands,

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:02.840
let's take her to bed
like the Emperor did!

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:04.650
-Let's go!
-Go!

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.240
Check over there!

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:05.770
Go, guys!

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:25.880
You're unable to speak?

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:30.520
Now I understand

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.860
why you steal for a living.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:03.830
Xiahou Dan.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.440
Calling my name already, huh?

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:25.740
"Being ill,

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:28.960
the late Emperor felt
death was drawing near.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.680
This edict was therefore made
to pass the throne to the Crown Prince.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.540
But given the latter's minority,

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:38.240
Prince Duan is vested
the power to govern as regent."

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.930
Honorary titles

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:43.550
are mere vanities.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.330
Pick whatever you like, Your Majesty.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.310
All is fine by me.

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:52.630
Why don't you dress up
as the Empress Dowager

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:53.860
in women's clothes?

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.880
Xiahou Dan!

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.680
I forgot it.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.430
You're scared of her.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.080
What did you just say?

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.830
You knew clearly from the beginning

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.720
who harmed your mother

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.790
and you.

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:31.140
But you had no choice
but to turn a blind eye

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:33.860
and a deaf ear to the truth.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.060
You decided to vent all your anger

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:42.070
on an innocent person.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.790
Why?

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.110
Because you were too weak.

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.770
You had to direct your hatred to someone,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.530
or you couldn't have lived.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:00.720
So,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.590
you picked a soft target—

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.610
a headache sufferer,

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.070
and a mere puppet.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:15.810
Luck was the entire reason

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.570
that he ascended to the throne.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:24.170
Given that, you, Xiahou Bo,

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.410
feel the urge to tell the world

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.070
that you,

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.410
Prince Duan,

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:35.200
are better than him in every way,

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:37.680
and that only you are

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.240
meant to be the ruler.

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:57.520
As a defeated loser

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:01.000
behind bars,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.600
you're still talking tough.

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:08.150
You're saying all this to provoke me,
aren't you?

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.510
It won't work, Xiahou Dan.

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.150
Stop struggling.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.080
I've hit a nerve with you, right?

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:20.719
Shut up!

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.219
Your Highness,

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:26.480
I'll finish him.

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:27.699
No need.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.080
Make sure you rough the late Emperor up.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.010
Remember

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.900
to spare his right hand, though.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:40.190
He needs it to write his final edict.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:54.580
Yang, I...

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:56.639
I...

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.440
T-T-This is inappropriate.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:03.920
Er Lan, well, I...

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:04.710
I...

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:06.320
I didn't mean to intrude.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.120
I thought I entered Yang's room.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:12.610
This room is more spacious,

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:14.440
making it easier to attend to Cen.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.050
So I swapped rooms with Yang this morning.

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:16.710
Cen...

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.240
Cen...

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.490
Cen has arrived?

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.280
Not yet.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:22.280
Yang has set off to receive him.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:26.760
Li, do you ever consider

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.070
stop standing in the cold wind
by the door?

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:30.880
We've been through life and death
together.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.540
Just forego the formalities.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:45.360
Were you just saying

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.030
you had news about His Majesty?

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.400
Yes.

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:52.400
I waited at the palace gate all morning,

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.860
but still couldn't get in.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.550
Nonetheless, a young eunuch
guarding the gate said

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:59.760
Prince Duan summoned all ministers
to attend court tomorrow morning.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.200
He's just a prince.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:03.450
What right does he have to do that?

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.670
I actually think it's a good thing.

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:06.480
Hell no!

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.270
My apologies, Er Lan.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:13.030
I...

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:16.600
I've got used to it.
I keep forgetting that you are...

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:21.090
In fact, I somewhat miss the time

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:23.550
when you treated me like a man.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.460
We voiced our opinions

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.880
and argued till we were red in the face,

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.280
with the one and only focus

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.280
on offering counsel to His Majesty.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:33.960
But now,

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.320
Wang is gone.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:37.430
Her Highness is missing.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:39.240
His Majesty's fate is unknown.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:40.530
Given that,

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:42.030
though this is not a fair request,

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:43.360
I still have to ask you, Li,

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.960
to continue to conceal my identity
for a while.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.800
Just treat me the same as before.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:48.730
Sure.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:52.170
I got it.

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:57.600
I'll try my best.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.630
It has been

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.620
three days since the Mount Bei incident.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.030
The city gate is sealed,
and so is the palace gate.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:17.630
We have no access to any news.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.070
So, our only chance lies in

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.960
tomorrow's morning court session.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:23.630
Yes.

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:26.040
You m-made a good point.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:28.920
But you're injured now, Er Lan.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:30.670
You shouldn't risk attending court
tomorrow.

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:32.200
Just leave it to me and Yang.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.190
What is with you, Li?

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:36.320
After just promising to keep my secret,

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.780
you're giving it away now?

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:39.510
I-I'm not.

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.510
I haven't disclosed it to anyone...

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:42.880
If I were a man,

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.540
would I make a fuss
over a minor injury like this?

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.030
Yes.

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:49.070
Right.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.650
Although you

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.590
and Her Highness

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:52.280
are women,

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:53.920
you two are incredibly formidable.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:54.880
I admire both of you.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.880
I tip my hat to you.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:59.810
Who am I to be compared with Her Highness?

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:02.760
I wonder

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.310
where Her Highness is right now.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.260
Your Highness!

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:14.130
Your Highness.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:14.920
Your Highness,

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.000
we made it back alive.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:16.800
Chu Yi, Chu Si.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:18.800
Why are you dressed as Imperial Guards?

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.330
That gave me quite a fright!

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:23.120
You're injured?

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.760
If I hadn't knocked out
two Imperial Guards in the chaos

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.020
and put on their armor,

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.820
he would've lost his arm.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.710
Could those lousy fighters have wounded me

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:31.630
if I hadn't took

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:32.850
that blade for you?

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:33.510
You...

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:34.230
Cut it out.

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:36.150
What's the situation like?

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:37.070
Not good.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.710
People are searching everywhere
for Her Highness.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.040
We absolutely cannot take the main roads.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.800
But the distance between here

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.260
and Peiyang is over 500 li.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.110
What route can we take
if not the main roads?

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:50.590
After living in the palace for so long,

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:52.990
we're not familiar with the roads outside.

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:09.470
Do you mean...

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:11.120
you can be our guide?

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.250
You know the way?

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:20.960
Terrific.

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.630
But...

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.180
you might get in danger

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.480
for sticking with us.

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:27.850
Will you still join us?

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.960
You want payment?

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:41.960
Chu Wu,

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:43.090
give her some food.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.240
By the way,

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:46.050
I don't know your name yet.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.600
You don't have a name?

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.070
Why do none of you

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:58.630
have names?

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:04.090
Well...

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.010
How about I give you a name?

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:12.530
Let me think...

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.990
We'll call you

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.000
"Flower."

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.650
What do you think?
