=Episode 27=

00:01:19.152 --> 00:01:20.551
The explosive was black powder.

00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:23.111
Judging by the damage to this house,
it was caused by

00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:23.872
small amounts.

00:01:23.952 --> 00:01:26.872
But I found traces
of an accelerant at the scene.

00:01:27.432 --> 00:01:32.072
However, we need Ziwu
to test the specific components.

00:01:32.512 --> 00:01:35.271
The presence of an accelerant confirms
this is a criminal case.

00:01:37.072 --> 00:01:38.631
How was the explosive detonated?

00:01:40.312 --> 00:01:41.512
That's still unclear

00:01:41.512 --> 00:01:44.952
because the only evidence
we got right now is a blown-up phone,

00:01:44.952 --> 00:01:46.952
along with some glass
and plastic fragments.

00:01:49.512 --> 00:01:51.831
Could the phone have been the detonator?

00:01:53.672 --> 00:01:55.551
Igniting black powder
requires an open flame.

00:01:56.831 --> 00:01:59.551
There are no signs of a short circuit
on the phone's motherboard.

00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:01.271
It wasn't connected
to any external device.

00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:03.551
I need time to re-check it.

00:02:03.712 --> 00:02:05.032
You may go, and I'll look around.

00:02:15.791 --> 00:02:16.511
Ye,

00:02:17.032 --> 00:02:17.751
the landlord said

00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:19.552
the tenant of this place is Gao Liang.

00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:21.272
That woman is his girlfriend.

00:02:21.312 --> 00:02:22.911
But they don't live together.

00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:24.911
She comes to see him every now and then.

00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:26.791
The landlord also mentioned

00:02:26.992 --> 00:02:28.392
that he's a freelancer,

00:02:28.392 --> 00:02:30.351
but she doesn't know
what kind of work he does.

00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:33.951
The landlord doesn't
have Gao Liang's ID information?

00:02:34.592 --> 00:02:36.671
The rental process
for this place wasn't formal.

00:02:36.712 --> 00:02:39.592
There was no agency involved,
and no rental contract was signed.

00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:41.392
As long as you paid, you could rent it.

00:02:42.032 --> 00:02:43.592
The rent isn't expensive.

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:45.511
The surveillance camera
is already broken.

00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:47.896
The landlord didn't fix it
due to the high repair fee.

00:02:48.071 --> 00:02:49.112
According to the landlord,

00:02:49.112 --> 00:02:51.032
Gao Liang was quite generous,

00:02:51.272 --> 00:02:53.272
never delaying the monthly rent payment.

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:54.872
He always paid on time.

00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:56.951
And he always paid in cash.

00:02:57.671 --> 00:02:59.471
He was a quiet person

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:00.272
and kept to himself.

00:03:00.351 --> 00:03:01.791
Even when his girlfriend came,

00:03:01.832 --> 00:03:03.992
they both just stayed
silently inside the room.

00:03:06.471 --> 00:03:07.392
Let the landlord

00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:09.071
check all the available footage

00:03:09.351 --> 00:03:11.071
to confirm Gao Liang's appearance.

00:03:11.511 --> 00:03:12.272
Okay.

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:16.552
The landlord identified this person
as Gao Liang.

00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:19.671
But the public camera
has limited resolution.

00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:22.191
This is the clearest photo
we can get right now.

00:03:22.832 --> 00:03:23.392
Seriously?

00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:25.992
Isn't there one without sunglasses?

00:03:27.392 --> 00:03:28.951
The landlord said

00:03:29.071 --> 00:03:30.152
he wore them indoors too.

00:03:30.152 --> 00:03:31.032
Had a condition.

00:03:31.032 --> 00:03:31.751
Must avoid light.

00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:32.511
Nonsense.

00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:34.751
Is that what the landlord actually said?

00:03:36.592 --> 00:03:37.392
Just keep going.

00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:41.471
So the landlord doesn't actually know
what he really looks like either.

00:03:42.712 --> 00:03:44.511
The accelerant
at the scene was gasoline.

00:03:44.631 --> 00:03:45.872
Due to the explosion and fire,

00:03:46.152 --> 00:03:48.712
evidence like fingerprints
and DNA was basically destroyed.

00:03:49.351 --> 00:03:51.312
These two were extremely wary.

00:03:51.951 --> 00:03:53.751
They set fire just to destroy evidence.

00:03:55.312 --> 00:03:58.992
Any leads
on the source of the sodium metal?

00:03:59.631 --> 00:04:02.432
We're checking all chemical suppliers
in the city.

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:07.191
But the suspects could also obtain it
from school labs at various levels.

00:04:07.392 --> 00:04:08.312
The scope is too wide.

00:04:08.511 --> 00:04:09.392
It's challenging.

00:04:09.552 --> 00:04:11.992
What about the gunpowder
from the explosion?

00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:14.191
We found paper scraps at the scene.

00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:17.471
Preliminary assessment suggests
it's from fireworks sold locally.

00:04:17.871 --> 00:04:20.152
Although fireworks are banned
within the city limits,

00:04:20.431 --> 00:04:23.152
the suburbs aren't covered
by that restriction.

00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:24.551
Are you busy right now?

00:04:24.592 --> 00:04:25.471
Have you eaten?

00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:27.351
Not busy.

00:04:27.592 --> 00:04:28.832
It's not busy right now.

00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:30.832
You're still working?

00:04:32.152 --> 00:04:33.072
Yeah, I am.

00:04:34.351 --> 00:04:35.072
Jing,

00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:38.072
do you remember Liu Xiaofeng?

00:04:39.072 --> 00:04:39.871
Yeah, I do.

00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:41.032
What about him?

00:04:42.952 --> 00:04:44.551
I almost forgot one thing.

00:04:44.871 --> 00:04:46.392
I actually ran into him the other day.

00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:48.712
When? Where?

00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:49.832
Tell me more.

00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:55.791
Thank you.

00:04:58.152 --> 00:05:02.032
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:04.832
Oh, it's you.

00:05:08.512 --> 00:05:09.272
It's okay.

00:05:10.592 --> 00:05:12.192
Just don't do that again, okay?

00:05:13.392 --> 00:05:15.272
Okay, it won't happen again.

00:05:15.272 --> 00:05:16.072
I'm sorry.

00:05:16.192 --> 00:05:17.192
I'm really sorry.

00:05:23.712 --> 00:05:24.311
That's it.

00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:25.791
Then he just left.

00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:27.272
What?

00:05:28.952 --> 00:05:29.752
What?

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:33.431
Chief Xu.

00:05:35.592 --> 00:05:37.111
Ye, come with me for a moment.

00:05:37.272 --> 00:05:38.111
You all carry on.

00:05:38.551 --> 00:05:39.192
Go.

00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:45.471
Continue investigating the connections
of the deceased.

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:46.952
Extend the case.

00:05:47.392 --> 00:05:47.911
Yes.

00:05:47.991 --> 00:05:48.632
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:05:49.032 --> 00:05:52.632
First, I want to thank our comrades
from the city police department.

00:05:53.392 --> 00:05:55.791
You've worked hard during this period.

00:05:56.192 --> 00:06:01.111
Next, I hope
you'll formulate a detailed plan

00:06:01.832 --> 00:06:03.072
and broaden the investigation

00:06:03.592 --> 00:06:06.072
to eliminate the drug scourge
in Yunxi City

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:09.351
and completely crush the drug dealers.

00:06:45.791 --> 00:06:49.152
Recently, we've achieved a major victory

00:06:49.152 --> 00:06:51.712
by taking down a major criminal gang
led by Bao Hei.

00:06:52.351 --> 00:06:56.911
We've precisely struck against crime
and maintained social security.

00:06:57.431 --> 00:07:00.192
During this operation,
the police executed a clever setup.

00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:02.832
They successfully
apprehended four drug dealers,

00:07:02.832 --> 00:07:06.231
Huo, Dan Qing, Liu Zhua, and Madman,

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:09.032
who planned to trade
with Bao Hei's gang in our city.

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:11.832
Narcotics officers then
disguised themselves as these four

00:07:11.832 --> 00:07:14.111
to continue the transaction
and gather evidence,

00:07:14.712 --> 00:07:16.351
ultimately leading to a huge success.

00:07:17.392 --> 00:07:21.072
(Sadly, we lost Chen Yumo,
an anti-narcotics officer.)

00:07:21.592 --> 00:07:24.471
(We'll remember her spirit forever.)

00:07:25.192 --> 00:07:28.792
(We also express our highest respect)

00:07:28.792 --> 00:07:31.911
(and heartfelt gratitude to all officers
involved in this operation.)

00:07:32.632 --> 00:07:34.032
(We will continue our efforts)

00:07:34.032 --> 00:07:38.512
(to make greater contributions
to the peace and stability of Wannan.)

00:09:35.392 --> 00:09:36.191
Hello, Master.

00:09:37.392 --> 00:09:38.232
(No-Name Diner)
Bye, Captain Qin.

00:09:38.632 --> 00:09:39.752
Jing, we'll come again.

00:09:40.071 --> 00:09:40.591
Okay.

00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:42.152
You can call me to order in advance.

00:09:47.551 --> 00:09:48.232
Ye.

00:09:49.551 --> 00:09:50.951
Your master has been here for ages.

00:09:51.392 --> 00:09:52.272
- Okay.
- Come on in.

00:09:52.431 --> 00:09:52.992
Over there.

00:09:55.992 --> 00:09:56.992
Have a seat.

00:09:58.352 --> 00:09:59.872
Were you riding around?

00:10:00.112 --> 00:10:01.112
I can do it myself.

00:10:02.472 --> 00:10:03.951
I went to the shooting range.

00:10:07.431 --> 00:10:09.272
Eat quickly. It's getting cold.

00:10:09.632 --> 00:10:12.431
Chief Xu wants you
to take a few days off.

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:13.911
What do you think?

00:10:15.791 --> 00:10:18.191
I don't want to rest right now.

00:10:19.791 --> 00:10:21.311
Don't try to tough it out with me.

00:10:21.791 --> 00:10:22.591
Take a few days off.

00:10:23.551 --> 00:10:24.551
Adjust yourself.

00:10:26.872 --> 00:10:28.232
It's not appropriate to rest now.

00:10:29.392 --> 00:10:30.591
The team is understaffed.

00:10:31.512 --> 00:10:32.951
And the case hasn't been solved yet.

00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:36.752
I know you're very sad.

00:10:39.791 --> 00:10:43.911
Come back to work
after you've adjusted your mindset.

00:10:45.671 --> 00:10:46.591
It's not necessary.

00:10:46.632 --> 00:10:47.431
I'm fine.

00:10:47.992 --> 00:10:48.911
Really?

00:10:52.112 --> 00:10:52.911
Eat.

00:10:54.152 --> 00:10:54.951
Have some more.

00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:31.032
Today, we gather with heavy hearts.

00:12:32.272 --> 00:12:36.311
Here, we deeply mourn our dear comrade,

00:12:37.191 --> 00:12:42.352
Chen Yumo, an outstanding Party member.

00:12:42.352 --> 00:12:44.591
(Martyr Chen Yumo's Tomb)

00:12:44.591 --> 00:12:45.872
The heroine has departed.

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:47.632
But her noble spirit endures.

00:12:47.992 --> 00:12:49.392
She is resting here

00:12:49.632 --> 00:12:50.791
with her loyal soul.

00:12:51.992 --> 00:12:56.872
Today, we bid farewell
to our beloved comrade Chen Yumo here.

00:12:57.671 --> 00:13:00.951
At the same time,
we will learn from Chen Yumo

00:13:01.272 --> 00:13:04.791
about her fearless sacrifice
and dedicated spirit.

00:13:05.472 --> 00:13:07.071
We promise to protect the people,

00:13:07.671 --> 00:13:09.911
uphold social fairness and justice,

00:13:10.392 --> 00:13:11.512
stay true to our missions,

00:13:11.831 --> 00:13:13.152
and march forward.

00:13:28.472 --> 00:13:29.431
All personnel.

00:13:30.232 --> 00:13:30.951
Put on hats.

00:13:34.232 --> 00:13:35.032
Salute.

00:13:40.872 --> 00:13:42.272
(I once fell into an abyss,)

00:13:42.591 --> 00:13:43.791
(shrouded in darkness.)

00:13:44.551 --> 00:13:46.512
(But I never gave up looking for light.)

00:13:47.671 --> 00:13:51.671
(The shadows from my girlhood
cut deep into my heart like blades.)

00:13:52.512 --> 00:13:54.711
(Yet it was precisely this great pain)

00:13:55.071 --> 00:13:56.872
(that solidified my choice
of this path.)

00:14:00.272 --> 00:14:01.752
(I willingly put myself in danger,)

00:14:01.992 --> 00:14:03.272
(hiding within the darkness.)

00:14:04.632 --> 00:14:05.911
(I concealed my true identity,)

00:14:06.311 --> 00:14:08.551
(walking the boundary
between justice and evil.)

00:14:09.872 --> 00:14:11.591
(The path was strewn with thorns.)

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:13.911
(But I had become fearless)

00:14:15.232 --> 00:14:19.071
(because of my unwavering pursuit

When my son Xiaoyu was
about two or three years old,

00:18:39.791 --> 00:18:42.232
I was busy with a homicide case.

00:18:43.232 --> 00:18:44.111
Extremely busy.

00:18:44.351 --> 00:18:45.712
Working from dawn till dusk.

00:18:46.831 --> 00:18:48.952
I wouldn't get home until late at night.

00:18:51.512 --> 00:18:57.791
One day, I got home around four or five
in the morning after working.

00:18:59.111 --> 00:19:00.151
When I opened the door,

00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:05.311
my ex-wife was sitting right
in the middle of the living room,

00:19:06.391 --> 00:19:07.871
staring straight at the door.

00:19:09.912 --> 00:19:10.752
"You're back."

00:19:11.791 --> 00:19:12.591
I said, "Yeah."

00:19:14.071 --> 00:19:14.992
"Have you eaten?"

00:19:17.831 --> 00:19:19.432
"What case? Still can't talk about it?"

00:19:22.192 --> 00:19:23.032
"Let's get divorced."

00:19:26.391 --> 00:19:28.071
We got divorced that very day.

00:19:29.192 --> 00:19:30.631
After I got back home,

00:19:33.232 --> 00:19:35.631
I just couldn't believe I was divorced.

00:19:37.591 --> 00:19:40.391
I couldn't believe any of it was real.

00:19:43.111 --> 00:19:46.311

When you have time,

00:19:51.992 --> 00:19:54.551
you should

and those who love you.

00:20:01.272 --> 00:20:03.071
I feel sorry for her.

00:20:03.512 --> 00:20:05.992
I owe her too much.

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:19.351
Master.

00:20:22.032 --> 00:20:23.311
I just feel like...

00:20:27.791 --> 00:20:29.311
Back then, I didn't protect her.

00:20:31.672 --> 00:20:32.791
And it's the same now.

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:34.672
She was a good girl.

00:20:34.992 --> 00:20:38.831
That much is clear.

00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:43.752
You've done what you should have done.

00:20:44.591 --> 00:20:45.712
Don't blame yourself.

00:20:49.472 --> 00:20:53.151
Sometimes, people need
to learn to wipe the slate clean.

00:20:55.752 --> 00:20:57.311
You've got to look ahead.

00:21:03.831 --> 00:21:04.472
Master.

00:21:08.551 --> 00:21:12.752
If you had another chance to choose,

00:21:14.712 --> 00:21:17.512
would you still choose to marry her?

00:21:23.672 --> 00:21:24.472
Yes.

00:21:28.232 --> 00:21:29.831
That's fate, I suppose.

00:21:31.232 --> 00:21:32.952
I would love her

00:21:37.232 --> 00:21:38.391
and spend more time with her.

00:21:45.391 --> 00:21:47.752
Sometimes,
people aren't really that busy.

00:21:49.311 --> 00:21:50.631
It's just an excuse.

00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:00.984
(Yunxi Police Department)

00:22:04.151 --> 00:22:05.952
I've never seen either
of these two people.

00:22:06.672 --> 00:22:08.071
I don't know if Xiaofeng

00:22:08.071 --> 00:22:09.032
knew them either.

00:22:10.551 --> 00:22:11.928
What about Liu Xiaofeng's friends?

00:22:13.752 --> 00:22:14.992
If he'd had friends,

00:22:14.992 --> 00:22:18.311
he wouldn't have been bored enough
to do that stupid thing.

00:22:18.551 --> 00:22:20.032
He'd been unsociable since childhood.

00:22:20.871 --> 00:22:23.032
I had no idea
what was going on in his head.

00:22:23.928 --> 00:22:25.464
He always surfed the internet at home.

00:22:26.151 --> 00:22:27.912
My fault for not correcting him sooner.

00:22:28.032 --> 00:22:30.432
He'd spend all day
looking at weird stuff online.

00:22:31.232 --> 00:22:32.631
What did Liu Xiaofeng do online?

00:22:32.631 --> 00:22:33.512
Do you know?

00:22:33.512 --> 00:22:34.351
I don't.

00:22:35.232 --> 00:22:36.631
He didn't want me in his room.

00:22:36.752 --> 00:22:37.952
He kept his door shut.

00:22:39.992 --> 00:22:45.391
Could this woman be someone
Liu Xiaofeng met online?

00:22:45.752 --> 00:22:47.752
How could a girl like her
be interested in him?

00:22:48.311 --> 00:22:49.311
He had no money.

00:22:49.551 --> 00:22:50.752
What would she see in him?

00:22:52.391 --> 00:22:55.232
Did Liu Xiaofeng offend anyone?

00:22:55.871 --> 00:22:58.272
Just those dog owners and dog lovers.

00:22:58.272 --> 00:22:59.871
We've paid the compensation.

00:22:59.871 --> 00:23:00.831
What more do they want?

00:23:00.831 --> 00:23:02.232
Is it ever going to end?

00:23:03.032 --> 00:23:04.912
Anyway, he just poisoned some dogs.

00:23:05.151 --> 00:23:07.391
Did anyone threaten Liu Xiaofeng?

00:23:13.311 --> 00:23:14.631
Do you know who they are?

00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:17.551
They were all Internet users.

00:23:29.871 --> 00:23:32.536
Did forensic unit find
any valuable fingerprints

00:23:32.536 --> 00:23:34.631
on the internet cafe's computers?

00:23:35.712 --> 00:23:37.111
It's a public place, after all.

00:23:37.111 --> 00:23:38.272
People come and go.

00:23:38.311 --> 00:23:39.791
According to the internet cafe owner,

00:23:39.791 --> 00:23:41.752
that woman seemed particularly clean.

00:23:41.752 --> 00:23:42.952
She would clean the chairs,

00:23:42.952 --> 00:23:45.952
table, computer, mouse, and so on
before and after using the computer.

00:23:46.551 --> 00:23:49.232
Seems she was already preparing
to evade detection.

00:24:03.871 --> 00:24:05.912
Has the internet cafe been allowed
to open?

00:24:05.912 --> 00:24:06.551
Not yet.

00:24:09.871 --> 00:24:10.831
Hello? Chief Xu.

00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:12.791
Today?

00:24:13.752 --> 00:24:14.432
Okay.

00:24:15.631 --> 00:24:17.752
Notify the forensic unit
to revisit the internet cafe.

00:24:17.871 --> 00:24:18.512
Yes, sir.

00:24:31.831 --> 00:24:33.032
Left index finger.

00:24:33.791 --> 00:24:34.551
Looks intact.

00:24:34.551 --> 00:24:36.509
Judging by the shape and size,
likely from a girl.

00:24:36.712 --> 00:24:37.831
Well done, Long.

00:24:37.871 --> 00:24:38.831
You're the best.

00:24:41.551 --> 00:24:42.512
Where's Little Qian?

00:24:42.512 --> 00:24:43.631
Haven't seen him these days.

00:24:43.831 --> 00:24:44.631
Who knows?

00:24:44.631 --> 00:24:46.752
When we were analyzing the case,

00:24:46.752 --> 00:24:48.232
Chief Xu called him away.

00:24:48.232 --> 00:24:49.551
He hasn't come back yet.

00:25:00.432 --> 00:25:02.542
Both sides of the road
before the apartment entrance

00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:04.512
are lined with cars of nearby residents.

00:25:05.032 --> 00:25:08.791
This was captured by the dashcam
of one of those private cars.

00:25:09.871 --> 00:25:12.992
The time was 11:30 PM
on the night of the crime.

00:25:14.432 --> 00:25:15.551
That should be the suspect.

00:25:15.712 --> 00:25:17.672
But it didn't capture her leaving.

00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:22.032
The time of death was around midnight.

00:25:23.071 --> 00:25:26.272
So this person entered the elevator
from the entrance

00:25:26.831 --> 00:25:28.151
and then went up to the rooftop.

00:25:28.631 --> 00:25:30.584
The whole process
would take at least 10 minutes.

00:25:30.952 --> 00:25:33.551
Can the suspect complete the murder
in such a short time?

00:25:35.151 --> 00:25:36.472
It's more complicated than that.

00:25:37.512 --> 00:25:41.791
The elevator cameras inside the building
didn't capture her getting in or out.

00:25:41.831 --> 00:25:44.111
It means she took the unmonitored

00:25:44.111 --> 00:25:44.992
fire escape stairs.

00:25:45.631 --> 00:25:46.672
Such a high floor.

00:25:46.672 --> 00:25:48.151
Considering the speed and stamina,

00:25:48.311 --> 00:25:49.631
an average person can't do it.

00:25:49.992 --> 00:25:50.992
What about Liu Xiaofeng?

00:25:51.391 --> 00:25:52.791
The camera didn't catch him either.

00:25:53.351 --> 00:25:55.071
Did he take the stairs too?

00:25:55.351 --> 00:25:56.472
Probably.

00:25:58.111 --> 00:26:00.472
Liu Xiaofeng had done bad things before.

00:26:01.071 --> 00:26:03.992
Maybe he was still
plotting something bad back then.

00:26:03.992 --> 00:26:05.032
Really?

00:26:05.672 --> 00:26:09.192
According to Cao,
Liu Xiaofeng sincerely apologized.

00:26:09.512 --> 00:26:11.791
Just the other day,
Jing ran into him at the market.

00:26:11.791 --> 00:26:12.631
He kept apologizing.

00:26:12.631 --> 00:26:14.472
It actually made her feel quite awkward.

00:26:15.311 --> 00:26:16.512
Actions can be deceiving.

00:26:19.672 --> 00:26:21.351
Liu Xiaofeng's payment records show

00:26:21.551 --> 00:26:23.871
that he'd been
frequenting this sports club lately.

00:26:28.952 --> 00:26:30.071
Don't worry, Master.

00:26:30.712 --> 00:26:31.631
I'm fine.

00:26:31.831 --> 00:26:35.232
Liu Xiaofeng didn't strike me
as someone who loved sports.

00:26:36.512 --> 00:26:38.472
So this behavior of his is suspicious.

00:26:42.071 --> 00:26:44.672
This guy came a few times.

00:26:45.432 --> 00:26:47.912
He joined the beginner's archery class.

00:26:48.232 --> 00:26:49.311
He paid per lesson.

00:26:49.752 --> 00:26:51.432
A total beginner.

00:26:52.472 --> 00:26:54.071
Do you know why he learned archery?

00:26:54.391 --> 00:26:55.831
I'm not sure about that.

00:26:56.351 --> 00:26:58.752
Usually, it's just a hobby.

00:26:59.712 --> 00:27:02.551
But I do remember this guy.

00:27:03.591 --> 00:27:05.192
According to our coach,

00:27:05.432 --> 00:27:11.472
he always asked around
about where to buy restricted items.

00:27:11.952 --> 00:27:14.871
Do you have that kind of stuff here?

00:27:15.952 --> 00:27:17.672
We run a legitimate business.

00:27:17.672 --> 00:27:19.432
We never engage in illegal activities.

00:27:20.432 --> 00:27:21.591
But as you surely know,

00:27:21.912 --> 00:27:24.831
these days,
you can find anything online.

00:27:25.151 --> 00:27:28.992
Some of our veteran students
just can't keep their mouths shut.

00:27:29.192 --> 00:27:30.551
They just mentioned it casually,

00:27:30.551 --> 00:27:31.912
and he latched onto it.

00:27:32.391 --> 00:27:34.192
That really isn't our fault.

00:27:35.151 --> 00:27:39.752
Let us know in detail
if you remember anything else.

00:27:41.912 --> 00:27:45.871
Liu Xiaofeng had custom-made a crossbow.

00:27:48.391 --> 00:27:52.992
And he'd been inquiring
about where to buy cyanide.

00:27:53.432 --> 00:27:55.111
The young man who poisoned the dogs?

00:27:55.111 --> 00:27:55.752
Right.

00:27:56.952 --> 00:27:58.111
What was he planning to do?

00:27:58.111 --> 00:27:58.952
More dogs?

00:27:59.912 --> 00:28:02.992
Not dogs this time, I think.

00:28:03.432 --> 00:28:05.472
He was planning to kill a person.

00:28:08.311 --> 00:28:09.272
Do we have proof?

00:28:10.791 --> 00:28:11.712
We're working on it.

00:28:13.111 --> 00:28:15.831
There is only cookware
and leftovers in the kitchen.

00:28:15.831 --> 00:28:17.192
They can get your hands greasy.

00:28:17.712 --> 00:28:19.871
What exactly are you up to, officers?

00:28:20.192 --> 00:28:21.672
You won't find anything you want.

00:28:21.672 --> 00:28:22.391
- Alright.
- Search.

00:28:22.391 --> 00:28:23.192
I'll put it back.

00:28:23.351 --> 00:28:25.232
Check this out. Come on.

00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:27.591
My son just poisoned some dogs.

00:28:27.591 --> 00:28:29.311
What is all the fuss about?

00:28:29.672 --> 00:28:31.432
What could be in this shoe cabinet?

00:28:31.432 --> 00:28:32.831
Just a bunch of smelly shoes.

00:28:32.831 --> 00:28:33.831
Smells awful.

00:28:33.831 --> 00:28:35.631
Come give me a hand.

00:28:35.631 --> 00:28:37.192
Be careful with my TV set.

00:28:37.192 --> 00:28:38.311
It's brand new.

00:28:39.432 --> 00:28:40.391
Careful!

00:28:41.311 --> 00:28:42.432
- Okay now?
- I've checked.

00:28:44.272 --> 00:28:45.752
Give me a break.

00:28:45.752 --> 00:28:47.192
Xiaofeng was the victim.

00:28:47.992 --> 00:28:50.151
He didn't commit any crime.

00:28:50.992 --> 00:28:53.151
He just killed some dogs, right?

00:28:53.351 --> 00:28:54.672
Could you guys

00:28:54.672 --> 00:28:56.032
stop searching?

00:28:56.351 --> 00:28:58.791
A dog's life can't be more precious
than my son's, can it?

00:29:03.551 --> 00:29:04.391
Found something.

00:29:21.232 --> 00:29:22.871
This thing really works.

00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:28.192
See that?

00:29:29.712 --> 00:29:31.111
You insulted me.

00:29:32.071 --> 00:29:33.672
You forced me to apologize.

00:29:35.512 --> 00:29:36.351
Just you wait.

00:29:38.272 --> 00:29:39.752
I'll make you pay for that.

00:29:41.631 --> 00:29:45.551
This video was found
on the phone Liu Xiaofeng hid.

00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:47.791
The location is still being verified.

00:29:48.551 --> 00:29:52.791
That crossbow is basically consistent
with the one he purchased.

00:29:55.631 --> 00:29:58.232
This thing can be lethal
if it hits a vital spot.

00:29:59.791 --> 00:30:00.871
Listen up.

00:30:01.791 --> 00:30:04.432
Keep working
on Liu Xiaofeng's network and movements.

00:30:05.432 --> 00:30:08.672
That crossbow in the video absolutely
cannot be allowed into the public.

00:30:09.712 --> 00:30:11.111
Also, regarding Gao Liang

00:30:11.111 --> 00:30:13.472
and his girlfriend's identity
and whereabouts,

00:30:13.791 --> 00:30:14.712
keep digging.

00:30:14.831 --> 00:30:15.712
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:30:15.712 --> 00:30:16.512
Yes.

00:30:16.512 --> 00:30:17.151
Got it.

00:30:19.432 --> 00:30:23.272
Liu Xiaofeng didn't run into Jing
at the market by coincidence.

00:30:24.591 --> 00:30:25.831
Liu Xiaofeng

00:30:26.712 --> 00:30:31.232
was targeting all the pet owners
whose pets he poisoned.

00:30:31.432 --> 00:30:33.992
You're saying he was stalking Jing?

00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:35.111
It's possible.

00:30:35.791 --> 00:30:36.712
No way.

00:30:38.032 --> 00:30:40.232
Why would he want revenge on everyone?

00:30:44.311 --> 00:30:45.672
That's terrifying.

00:30:46.672 --> 00:30:48.712
Appearances can be deceiving.

00:30:48.912 --> 00:30:50.672
Thankfully, nothing happened.

00:30:52.512 --> 00:30:55.512
We have some evidence now.

00:30:55.591 --> 00:30:58.111
He seemed perfectly normal.

00:30:59.712 --> 00:31:00.551
I know

00:31:01.071 --> 00:31:02.512
he came from a single-parent home.

00:31:02.871 --> 00:31:03.952
Lived with his mother.

00:31:05.432 --> 00:31:07.551
She struggled so hard
to raise him this big.

00:31:08.432 --> 00:31:11.272
How heartbroken she'd be
when she found out.

00:31:38.752 --> 00:31:39.631
Dad.

00:31:40.952 --> 00:31:41.871
It's me.

00:31:45.591 --> 00:31:47.551
Someone just came to see you?

00:31:50.672 --> 00:31:52.311
You're mad at me, aren't you?

00:31:52.591 --> 00:31:54.432
I've had too many cases lately.

00:31:54.432 --> 00:31:56.512
I've been too busy.

00:31:57.712 --> 00:31:58.871
Don't be angry.

00:31:59.232 --> 00:32:01.551
I'll try to come every day from now on.

00:32:04.831 --> 00:32:05.631
Dad.

00:32:07.551 --> 00:32:09.752
Do you remember Ziwu?

00:32:10.912 --> 00:32:13.032
When she first joined the CID,

00:32:13.752 --> 00:32:16.631
she couldn't get used
to the crime scenes.

00:32:17.672 --> 00:32:19.512
I even made her cry a few times.

00:32:22.111 --> 00:32:22.912
Remember?

00:32:23.391 --> 00:32:26.111
Once, you came to see me,

00:32:26.472 --> 00:32:28.912
carrying a bag of tomatoes.

00:32:29.512 --> 00:32:30.791
I'd just yelled at her that day.

00:32:30.791 --> 00:32:32.272
She was crying in the hallway.

00:32:32.591 --> 00:32:35.952
You quietly took out two tomatoes
and handed them to her.

00:32:36.311 --> 00:32:37.591
You said,

00:32:38.032 --> 00:32:39.071
"Miss, eat them.

00:32:39.192 --> 00:32:40.432
These tomatoes are sweet.

00:32:41.111 --> 00:32:42.791
They'll make you feel better."

00:32:44.351 --> 00:32:45.432
Remember?

00:32:47.512 --> 00:32:50.512
That night at home, you scolded me,

00:32:51.232 --> 00:32:54.831
saying I was too harsh on the girl.

00:32:55.351 --> 00:32:59.151
You told me to treat female colleagues
gently like spring breeze.

00:32:59.391 --> 00:33:00.752
You remember?

00:33:03.151 --> 00:33:04.551
Ziwu

00:33:05.192 --> 00:33:07.311
has often said to me,

00:33:07.752 --> 00:33:09.432
"Your dad is such a good man.

00:33:10.311 --> 00:33:11.512
A truly great guy.

00:33:11.831 --> 00:33:12.712
Much better than you."

00:33:18.111 --> 00:33:19.472
And your grandson.

00:33:20.712 --> 00:33:22.912
He came to see me a few days ago.

00:33:24.192 --> 00:33:26.472
I know you love him very much.

00:33:26.912 --> 00:33:29.151
When he made trouble,

00:33:29.232 --> 00:33:30.551
you always defended him,

00:33:30.712 --> 00:33:31.871
afraid I'd hit him.

00:33:32.071 --> 00:33:33.111
Do you remember?

00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:35.351
Dad.

00:33:35.912 --> 00:33:36.712
Don't worry.

00:33:36.712 --> 00:33:39.952
Your grandson is better off
with his mom than with me.

00:33:42.432 --> 00:33:46.272
Next time, I'll bring him to see you.

00:33:52.032 --> 00:33:52.912
What's wrong?

00:33:55.831 --> 00:33:57.032
Does your fingernail hurt?

00:33:59.111 --> 00:34:00.912
Who clipped your fingernails?

00:34:00.912 --> 00:34:02.272
Was it Ziwu?

00:34:03.512 --> 00:34:06.591
See? She did a much nicer job
than I ever could.

00:34:08.352 --> 00:34:11.271
Go to sleep now, Dad.

00:34:11.271 --> 00:34:12.952
Relax your neck.

00:34:15.512 --> 00:34:16.711
Get some rest.

00:34:17.512 --> 00:34:19.912
I have to leave soon.

00:34:20.711 --> 00:34:21.872
I'm on duty.

00:34:22.872 --> 00:34:24.231
I'll come see you soon.

00:34:44.231 --> 00:34:45.071
Sweetie.

00:34:46.151 --> 00:34:47.671
How did you end up here again?

00:34:49.312 --> 00:34:50.071
What's wrong?

00:34:50.071 --> 00:34:51.271
Got nowhere to go?

00:34:54.872 --> 00:34:56.271
It just wandered over to our place.

00:34:57.071 --> 00:34:58.432
Guess we're meant to raise it.

00:34:58.432 --> 00:34:59.432
Let's keep it.

00:35:02.151 --> 00:35:03.711
It can't stay here tonight.

00:35:04.472 --> 00:35:05.551
Don't you want to keep it?

00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:09.671
We have to take it home
and clean it up first.

00:35:11.591 --> 00:35:13.231
Okay, let's take it home and clean it.

00:35:14.071 --> 00:35:15.032
Come on, sweetie.

00:35:15.352 --> 00:35:16.271
We're going home.

00:36:35.271 --> 00:36:37.111
You just ate some food.

00:36:38.352 --> 00:36:39.472
Want some more?

00:36:40.392 --> 00:36:40.832
Come on.

00:36:40.832 --> 00:36:42.392
A new member?

00:36:42.792 --> 00:36:43.432
Ziwu.

00:36:43.872 --> 00:36:44.872
What's its name?

00:36:44.952 --> 00:36:45.872
Xiaoka.

00:36:45.952 --> 00:36:47.591
Have a seat outside.

00:36:47.591 --> 00:36:48.832
Take a seat. I'm coming.

00:36:48.832 --> 00:36:49.912
Sit here.

00:36:50.551 --> 00:36:51.191
Sweetie,

00:36:51.231 --> 00:36:51.872
eat some more.

00:36:53.071 --> 00:36:55.231
Jing looks happy. It makes me happy too.

00:36:55.231 --> 00:36:55.952
My treat.

00:36:55.952 --> 00:36:56.751
What will you have?

00:36:57.872 --> 00:36:58.872
Two bowls of wontons.

00:36:59.472 --> 00:37:00.551
Two bowls?

00:37:01.151 --> 00:37:02.271
Captain Leng's coming later.

00:37:03.151 --> 00:37:03.952
Got it.

00:37:18.151 --> 00:37:19.271
A bowl of wontons, Jiao.

00:37:24.032 --> 00:37:24.992
Coming.

00:37:25.792 --> 00:37:27.312
Two bowls are ready.

00:37:27.671 --> 00:37:28.352
Here.

00:37:29.071 --> 00:37:29.751
Help yourselves.

00:37:29.751 --> 00:37:30.352
Vinegar.

00:37:31.952 --> 00:37:33.231
How about we go together later?

00:37:46.312 --> 00:37:47.032
Ziwu.

00:37:49.432 --> 00:37:52.191
What's your take
on the Liu Xiaofeng case?

00:37:56.792 --> 00:37:58.402
Long says the result on the fingerprints

00:37:58.402 --> 00:38:00.088
from the vending machine
will be out today.

00:38:02.952 --> 00:38:03.751
That's all?

00:38:05.512 --> 00:38:06.312
You eat.

00:38:06.992 --> 00:38:07.472
Okay.

00:40:25.112 --> 00:40:31.512
(Being recorded. Please wait)

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.024
(Comparison in progress)

00:40:56.024 --> 00:40:57.144
(Target fingerprint
matches the original one)

00:40:57.591 --> 00:40:58.671
Done.

00:41:01.389 --> 00:41:06.026
(After comparison,
the crossbow fingerprint matches.)

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:11.271
(No corresponding fingerprint detected.)

00:41:11.271 --> 00:41:12.472
For real?

00:41:23.631 --> 00:41:24.271
Captain Leng.

00:41:25.271 --> 00:41:27.671
I need to brief you on something.

00:41:27.671 --> 00:41:29.071
The fingerprint results are out.

00:41:50.032 --> 00:41:51.231
Let me update everyone.

00:41:52.392 --> 00:41:58.231
The fingerprint from the vending machine
hasn't been matched to an identity yet.

00:41:58.512 --> 00:42:01.711
The same fingerprint has been found
at three other active crime scenes,

00:42:02.751 --> 00:42:06.711
namely, Cheng Jianmin's
accidental death at home,

00:42:06.952 --> 00:42:09.432
(Zhou Lianqin's suspected suicide
at the guesthouse,)

00:42:09.591 --> 00:42:11.432
(and Wen Yong's disappearance.)

00:42:11.551 --> 00:42:13.751
(There are doubts about
the three cases.)

00:42:13.751 --> 00:42:15.952
(The relevant units
are still following up.)

00:42:16.352 --> 00:42:18.512
(After consulting
with the city police department,)

00:42:18.751 --> 00:42:21.912
(Chief Xu has decided
to let us investigate the three cases)

00:42:22.032 --> 00:42:23.711
(alongside this case we're working on.)
