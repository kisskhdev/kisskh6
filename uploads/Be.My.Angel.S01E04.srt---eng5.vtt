What's that?

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.690
It's the number of the person
who sent in the demo.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.620
He owns a TV show.

I don't think he'll be that bad.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.270
I'm probably overthinking it.

This week, we're at a restaurant
with a dark history,

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.820
where a husband came to sing
with his mistress...

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.220
And his wife shot him dead.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.980
He was dead at the scene.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.150
Look.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.640
The mic's still lying
where he was holding it!

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.260
They said that

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.040
on some nights,

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.980
his favorite song

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.280
would randomly play.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.320
And today,

so much energy on this nonsense.

She is not like the other ladies-in-waiting.

Is their meeting

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.800
a plan or fate?

for an hour straight,

those images from that ghost show

You're right.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.560
I got goosebumps.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.660
Honestly, Jane,

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.740
let's just put that
Small-World Phenomenon...

every time I help you bake shio pan,

I'll work really, really hard

and won't give you a headache anymore.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.040
You're all pouting now.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.000
Okay.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.700
Let's give it a try.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.460
Ma'am, would you like some shio pan?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.220
What?!

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.230
It's gonna be fine.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.100
We can do it!

Care for some shio pan?

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.020
- Shio pan?
- It's not pricey.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.040
Care for some shio pan?

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.940
Why is no one buying it?

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.260
They will.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.200
I've been standing for an hour straight.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.530
Let me help.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.040
My babies are all flat now.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.440
Care for some shio pan?

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.020
I'll have one shio pan.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.420
Of course!

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.450
Okay, sure!

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.600
Come on.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.130
Here.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.200
- Here you go.
- 60 baht.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.080
We got a customer!

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:37.910
- I got it.
- What?

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:38.990
I know what we should do next.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.370
What?

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.340
Watch

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:42.690
and learn.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.970
Shio pan, shio pan.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.550
Would you like some?

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.910
Act cutesy.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.690
Shio pan, shio pan.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.620
Would you like some?

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.290
Would you like some?

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.270
- Is this really gonna work?
- Would you like some...

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.080
- They don't seem interested.
- Are we scaring them off?

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.310
- Shio pan, shio pan.
- Shio pan, shio pan.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.430
Would you like some?

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.620
- Shio pan, shio pan.
- Would you like some?

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.190
How much is it?

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.190
It's 60 a piece.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.760
- She came back for us.
- It's buy 2 get 1 free.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:10.820
Then, I'll have...

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.420
- Right...
- It's 60 a piece.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.820
Here you go.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.620
We've got a red note!

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.030
Yay!

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.440
I'm so happy!

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.710
Yay!

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.040
Would you like some shio pan?

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:39.870
We're almost sold out.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.830
We've already made a lot of sales today.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.130
If there are any left,
I'm eating every last one.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.130
You can't!

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.320
They are for sale!

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.330
Would you like some shio pan?

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.660
- Shio pan...
- Would you like some...

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:00.150
- Sorry...
- Sorry...

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.240
We're sorry...

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.000
Sorry...

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.060
That was satisfying.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.270
I had so much fun.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.020
Me too!

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.490
The total was around 2,000 baht,

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.480
and that doesn't include
the mobile banking payments

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.210
That's a lot of money.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.640
Maybe today we only had 20-baht notes,

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.560
but someday I'll make them
all 1,000-baht ones.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.640
I know you will.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.120
Trust me.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.320
Thanks.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.870
'Jane Bakery.'

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.420
The name to remember!

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.190
Our premium shio pan

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.340
is buy 2, get 1 free.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.510
Buy 6,

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.760
get 3 free!

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:28.960
Hey, look!

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.960
This video got over a thousand views!

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.360
Why did so many people watch it?

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.540
It only had 10-20 views before.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.710
Let me look at the comments...

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.200
"You look so dope in those costumes!"

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.040
"Your voice is beautiful."

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.340
"The Shio Pan song is totally adorable!"

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.480
Are they exaggerating?

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.280
Everybody meant it!

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.780
Maybe it's because
someone shared the video.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:02.510
Hey...

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.220
You've really made a name for yourself.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.470
Come on,

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:07.760
it's just a thousand views.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.790
But it's much better
than 10-20 views, isn't it?

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:13.760
You have a point...

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.560
Just imagine...

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.670
With just one video,

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.300
our shio pan sales went up this much.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:23.900
If we keep this up,

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:27.760
won't we become millionaires?!

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.730
Easy, Jane.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.840
We've just started.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.220
Or should we think about
going on Pai's show again?

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.720
Why do you have to bring this up again?

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:46.740
What?

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.060
His show is pretty big.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.720
If you just bite the bullet
and go on his show,

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.500
you'll blow up even more.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.070
I don't want to, Jane.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.560
It's scary.
I don't wanna go on that show.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.130
Besides,

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.100
once the MV we filmed
for Miss Clare comes out,

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.740
we'll totally blow up.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:16.440
Actually, it's been out for a while.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:17.560
What?

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:18.810
But it

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.200
totally flopped.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.740
Look.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.980
It couldn't even reach 10,000 views,

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.120
and people in the comments were saying...

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.080
the song sucked.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.700
Why did it turn out like that?

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.680
I have no clue.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:43.980
By the way...

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.420
Why didn't you tell me
the MV was already out?

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.960
What? It's just...

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.060
It's...

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.740
nothing...

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.480
What's on your mind?

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.630
Nothing. Just...

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:03.600
That's cringe.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.200
You don't wanna see it.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.110
Cringe?

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:08.860
What's so cringe about it?

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:15.720
That's sus.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:17.520
No,

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.080
it's nothing!

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.640
What's cringe about it?

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.640
Then...

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.760
Can you show it to me?

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.550
Please?

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.630
Please, please, please.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.840
Please, please, Jane!

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.960
No.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.070
Pwease?

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:37.930
I wanna watch it...

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.040
Pwease?

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.150
Fine.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.110
Where?

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.260
Let me watch it.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.240
Well,

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.270
we'll check it out later!

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.860
Let's check it out right now.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.260
We'll watch it on the laptop later.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.260
It has a bigger screen.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.800
Fine.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.060
I'll check you out for now.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.900
Why would you?!

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:44.540
Whoa...

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.020
"Whoa"?

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.560
Look at this scene.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.400
Why?

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.500
You seem like such a naughty girl.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.620
Huh?

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.420
Well,

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.230
when you kissed me.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:06.390
It wasn't a kiss.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.160
It was a peck!

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.110
Whatever.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:09.950
A peck is fine.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.780
It's different.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.410
When you gave me a peck,

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.940
you were so expressive.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.100
What do you mean?

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.670
When you went in for that peck,

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.880
you didn't even blush.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.000
But look at you now.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:36.990
I'm not blushing.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:37.900
You talk too much!

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.800
Why did you hide your face
in the blanket?

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.140
What?!

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.260
Well...

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:48.390
I was cold.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:49.660
Oh...

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.150
Cold?

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.070
Really?

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.500
I was!

00:21:59.170 --> 00:21:59.970
Well,

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.460
I was in work mode at the studio,

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.100
unlike now when I'm just watching it.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.260
Don't you feel that way?

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.520
That means...

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.520
you're blushing right now.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.600
Are you?

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.810
You sure talk a lot.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.380
What are you even saying? I'm not!

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:31.700
Hey!

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.360
- I'm not blushing!
- Give me that.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:37.920
No!

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.360
Give me that!

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:40.730
No!

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:23.720
Someone's at the door.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:44.580
What?!

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.040
Duang-Jai.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.820
How did you get in?

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.900
I saw the door wasn't locked,
so I just walked in.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:05.740
Z!

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:07.980
I'm coming!

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.340
Duang-Jai!

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.960
Long time no see!

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.160
I miss you!

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.230
I miss you too, bud.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.970
So...

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.490
what are you doing here this late?

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.570
Right, I almost forgot.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.530
Here.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.580
Miss and Z, take a look at this.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.790
Look at Z's score right now.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.700
It suddenly skyrocketed.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.460
Just a little more and you'll reach Y rank.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.220
But...

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:44.920
why is this the case?

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:46.320
I know, right?

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:47.580
I was wondering the same.

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.360
That's why I sneaked here today.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.780
I know.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.590
It must be because of Jane's shio pan.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:00.760
Seriously?

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.920
You guys keep talking.

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.180
I'll make a phone call and be right back.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:19.980
Duang-Jai, I'm so happy!

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.250
I can't believe my eyes.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:09.760
I think...

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:13.800
we should start baking now.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:33.420
Today we have 48 shio pans

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.190
that need to be delivered before 2 P.M.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.400
Let's dive in!

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:40.000
Okay!

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.060
Okay.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.840
Now,

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.370
tell me

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.400
the ingredients for 48 shio pans.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.310
2 kilograms of bread flour,

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.030
200 grams of sugar,

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.510
32 grams of salt,

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.970
32 grams of yeast,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.250
680 cc of milk,

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.730
80 grams of whipped cream,

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.960
and 160 grams of butter.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.330
Yay!

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.300
Wait!

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.120
This is pure flaky sea salt.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:22.960
It's essential!

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.480
You're even better than me now, huh?

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:30.470
Come on,

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.630
let's start baking.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:35.920
Start!

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.520
Let me do it for you.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.000
This is how you put the box together.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.480
- There!
- Hey!

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:34.900
Hey!

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:15.810
All 48 pieces

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.420
are done.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.600
- Yay!
- Yay!

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:23.480
This is unbelievable, Jane!

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:24.210
True,

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.740
but what's more unbelievable

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.640
is you didn't make a single mistake!

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.340
How was that possible?

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:41.960
Filming's confirmed for tomorrow.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:49.500
Z...

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.450
The show...

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.260
contacted me with a confirmation.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.400
What show?

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.160
And what confirmation?

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:01.030
Well...

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.480
'A night with the Ghosts'
confirmed the filming date.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.520
But we canceled them, didn't we?

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.380
We did...

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:17.210
but I contacted them again.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.380
Why would you do that?

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.020
What? Well...

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.360
Think about it.

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:27.060
More people watched our videos,

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:29.200
we made a lot more sales,

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.020
and you almost ranked up.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.060
If you get more famous,

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.240
you could reach the top ranks!

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.600
That way, you won't have to deal
with spirits anymore.

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.720
You really shouldn't have done that.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.060
What?

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.510
We'll use 4 cameras

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.680
and set them up like CCTVs.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.020
Don't let them know we're filming.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:23.620
Sure.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.660
Oh, it's you.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:32.930
Just in time.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.580
Let's go see Pai.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.010
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:40.710
Whoa,

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.200
your costume is awesome.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.340
Come on, this way.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.160
Whoa!

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.220
Your outfit really fits the theme today.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:07.240
Look.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:12.860
Come on.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.540
Hurry up!

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.810
Hello, beloved viewers.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.780
This is Pai, and you're watching
'A Night with the Ghosts.'

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:29.810
This week, since we're talking
about horror,

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:32.000
this might be
the creepiest one yet

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.450
because...

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.680
Here are our guests for today.
Please come in.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.310
Hello, Jane and Z.

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.480
Hello.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.960
By the way...

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.680
Do you have to look like a ghost
to spend the night with one?

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.050
She just wanted to show
some respect for the show.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.390
Since this is a ghost show,

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.750
she dressed up like a ghost.

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.640
Right, okay.

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:57.850
Do you guys know

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.660
your mission for today?

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.980
Our mission?

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:04.070
Your mission is...

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.340
You have to sleep in a room with...

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.000
a dark history.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.880
What dark history?

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:15.760
This dorm was built about 50 years ago.

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:18.070
It was a typical dorm.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:21.220
People moved in and lived here.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.470
But the landlady said...

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.000
there was one room

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:30.560
nobody stayed in
for more than 2 months.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.560
They either died or moved out.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.360
The haunting of this room

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:45.510
was said to be caused by
the death of a worker

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.900
who was cemented into the wall.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.080
Not long ago,

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.660
a technician went in to fix the wall.

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.560
They knocked it down
and found a skeleton.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:03.240
Even after a ritual to free the spirit,

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.700
the haunting never stopped.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.280
And we have to spend the night
in that room?

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.400
We were better off staying out of it.

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:15.440
That's on you, Jane.

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:17.440
Let's just leave.

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:19.400
Hold on, you two.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.420
I wish you nothing but a peaceful night.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.489
Sweet dreams,

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.480
and I hope you make it until the morning.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.429
Ma'am,

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.560
have we met before?

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.980
I wouldn't know.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.360
I've worked here for a very long time.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.340
You might have caught a glimpse of me.

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:09.380
You both will stay here
until 6 in the morning.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.080
If you ask to leave before then,

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.180
you'll forfeit the prize money.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.360
Good luck.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:20.480
I hope you don't die or move out.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.760
Jeez, I'm sure it's nothing!

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.740
Are you being a goof right now?

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:57.240
Come on.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.320
It's only one night.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.730
Let's go.

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.220
Are you okay over there?

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.070
Pretty good...

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.330
Still safe and sound?

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.300
Are you scared?

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:26.340
I'm not.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.060
How is she not?

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.060
How are you doing over there?

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:36.340
It's all good over here.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:43.320
What's the matter?

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.520
Are you getting sleepy?

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:48.280
No, I'm not sleepy.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:52.460
Like I promised,
I'm gonna be up all night.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.000
What was that...

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.140
That was a setup by the staff.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:14.220
It's just a prank!

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.460
It's not real, so don't be scared!

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.780
Are you sure?

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:18.900
I am!

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.140
What about those?

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.080
Those are all fake.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:32.580
Then, what about those?

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.260
Those are also fake.

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.240
What about that?

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.440
That...

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.200
is real!

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.190
(Incanting)

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.790
All souls suffer and go through

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.000
birth, aging, pain, and death!

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.810
Jane.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.080
Jane!

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:30.680
Jane...

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.500
Didn't you say you were going to
stay up all night?

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:50.970
Hey, don't come any closer!

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.060
Stupid ghost!

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.700
- Don't come any closer!
- Jane!

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.410
Easy.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.650
It's morning already.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.030
Look, it's morning already.

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.520
Okay, there's the sun...

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.430
Whoa, did we survive?!

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.020
We sure did.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.100
Hey!

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.030
You survived because of me, you know?

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.400
You dozed off before midnight.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.560
But at least we survived!

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:29.160
Whoa!

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.030
[30,000 Baht for Completing
'A Night with the Ghosts']

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:33.690
Congratulations!

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.940
Here's your 30,000 baht!

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:39.890
I thought you were gonna quit
the moment the lights went out.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.920
If I hadn't fallen asleep,

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.630
I wouldn't have made it out, either.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.040
That's lucky for you.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.450
But...

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.180
before you go home,
I heard you were soaked in sweat, right?

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.790
My staff prepared
some shower supplies for you.

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:56.140
Take a shower before you leave, alright?

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.770
There's a scandal going around
that he's a player

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.300
who flirts with young actresses
invited to his show.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.370
By the end of next week,

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.690
the company will transfer the funds
to the account provided by Miss Jane.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.590
Alright.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.060
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.230
Uh, ma'am?

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.380
Do you know where Jane is?

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:27.890
Oh, she's taking a shower.

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.200
- The bathroom is right over there.
- I see...

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.410
Hey!

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.520
What are you doing?!

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.230
Whoa, whoa, hold up!

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:50.510
Wait! Listen!

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:51.610
- How could you do this?!
- I didn't!

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.980
I didn't do anything!

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.830
I haven't even done anything!

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.560
Calm down! Listen to me!

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:12.760
Look...

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.820
Let me see. What happened there?

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.150
Does it hurt?

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:18.280
- It does.
- That left a wound.

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:20.760
Hey!

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.300
The victim is sitting right here!

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.860
He acted like
he was gonna take your photos...

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.800
Wow... You old fart!

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.510
- How could you do that?
- Jane, hold up...

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.500
Calm down, Jane. Let's talk.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.760
He wasn't trying to take your photos.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.680
He was taking mine.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.240
Why did you do that?

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:54.210
You wanna know
who the owner of that demo is?

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:00.040
Look.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.500
Oh...

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:06.860
Tony!

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:09.940
Tony!

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:13.700
I'll make sure to use this theory to find it!

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:19.800
♫You secretly got my head in the clouds♫

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:23.140
It's Tony!

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:24.900
Tony who?

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:31.730
It's the one who sent this demo to me.

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:33.710
I told him you guys wanted to meet him,

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.070
so he said he wanted photos of you first
to see who you are.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.080
That's game over.

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.660
I don't think this will work.
He doesn't want to see you.

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:49.980
What?

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.790
Could you please help us, sir?

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.000
This is very important to us.

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:01.310
Please, sir. I'm so sorry about that...

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:02.550
Oh, now you call me "sir"

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.690
after beating me up?

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:04.540
You, too.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.260
You called me an old fart.
Don't think I'd forget it.

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:08.640
I'm sorry, sir...

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.770
I can't beg Tony to meet you,

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.560
but I'll tell you where his bar is.

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.130
Find it yourself.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.590
Alright.

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.530
Are you hurt?

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.100
- Hey, no. Get out.
- I...

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.180
Get out.

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.030
Get out.

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:31.060
I didn't do anything.

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.140
I don't see anyone here, Jane.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.490
That's fine.

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.440
We're here undercover.

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:02.680
- Let's go?
- Are you kids undercover?

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.610
Tell me what you need my help with.

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:13.180
Don't tell me...

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.040
♫Moka, moka♫

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.710
♫Moka...♫

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.700
This song...

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.440
Are you the writer of
the Moka dog food commercial song?

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:45.550
Knowing about my past
probably won't do me any good.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.430
I can't tell you anything else.

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:50.310
This is already putting us at a lot of risk!

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:52.020
Just trust me for once.

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:54.640
Z, my dear child!

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.540
Have you ever been in a relationship?

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:00.820
We're undercover here.

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:06.440
Dumb angel!

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.330
No one told you to conjure me a lover.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.440
I want you to be my lover!
