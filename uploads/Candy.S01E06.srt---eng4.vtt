00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
"Candy"

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.200
(Episode 6: I Don't Like Women at All)

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.240
Knock it off

00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:49.640
I barely slept last night, Si Han.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.800
Auntie Ling, you brought so much stuff?

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.479
Come back and visit whenever you can.

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.159
I'll save the best room for you.

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.799
Auntie Ling, I'm really going to miss you.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.159
Come visit often, okay?

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:09.479
Only country bumpkins eat this.

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:10.280
No!

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.736
Give it back to Auntie Ling.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.760
I...

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.319
I got it for you.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.920
Auntie Ling.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.959
All this time…

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.239
Thank you for looking after us.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.120
It's really hard to leave this place.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.400
Just visit often, okay?

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:29.599
Jiang Wan.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.640
So reluctant to leave?

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:32.279
Then stay and help Auntie Ling out.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.280
Seems like you adjusted pretty well anyway.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.159
Lin Can.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.760
Would it kill you to shut up?

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.479
Why don't *you* stay then?

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.439
My Nuan Nuan…

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.159
would miss me too much.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.159
Watch your mouth.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.680
There are cameras.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:49.999
Ugh, the sickening sweet smell of love.

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.519
Quiet.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.120
Lin Can.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.000
Remember to come hold my dress
for me at next month's awards ceremony

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.879
Oh I forgot...

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.799
You don't have the right to go anymore.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.760
Relax.

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.280
I'll pray for you at home.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.320
Hope you don't trip on the red carpet…

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.039
And fall flat on your face…

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.639
Like last year.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.560
You!

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.479
Si Han, let's go.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.439
Auntie Ling.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.879
We should get going too.

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.719
Bye.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:27.159
Bye.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.840
Bye.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.719
Travel safe.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.840
Bye, bye.

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:30.319
Bye.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.319
Yeah, bye.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.560
Finally home.

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:47.039
Home really is the best.

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:50.080
No place is better…

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.680
than your own humble home.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.560
I'm kinda hungry.

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:00.800
Time to cook, Assistant Wen.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.400
I'm not cooking.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.960
Assistant Wen…

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.159
is slacking off today.

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:06.280
We're so tired.

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:07.439
How about…

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.599
I help you?

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:12.639
Let's draw lots.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.760
To split the chores fairly.

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:15.879
Okay.

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:18.039
Pick.

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.039
You cook.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.080
Fine.

00:03:29.684 --> 00:03:30.684
Alright, I'll cook.

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:31.759
Mm-hmm.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.759
Just make instant noodles.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.719
Don't get creative.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.280
And don't blow up the kitchen.

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.599
Got it.

00:03:49.153 --> 00:03:50.593
"Make Food"

00:03:51.153 --> 00:03:52.280
"Make Food"

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.800
What?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.080
Conscience kicking in?

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:15.199
I just…

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.800
Don't want you blowing up the kitchen.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.480
Lin Can.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.240
Will you love me forever?

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.160
Of course.

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:24.920
You're the puppy I worked
so hard to bring home.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.480
*You're* the puppy!

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.040
Such an ugly outfit.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.216
What kind of taste do you have
to have to buy something like this?

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.279
It looks nice.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.240
Look.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.040
Your phone.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Answer it for me.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:41.800
Hello?

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:42.959
Hello?

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:43.959
Is this Ms. Lin Can?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Who is this?

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.919
This is the Heping Street Police Station.

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:50.375
Your mother has been detained for
drunk and disorderly conduct.

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:51.879
You need to come as soon as possible.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.839
Scam call.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.160
Ignore it.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.959
But they said…

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:02.486
It's nothing.

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:04.199
Don't worry about it.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.560
Okay.

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:26.639
President Shen.

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:28.639
They've finished the show and are back.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.360
Here's what we managed to capture.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.480
Your love story with
Lin Can is truly touching.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.399
Since you're so in love…

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:55.359
Why don't you go public yourselves?

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:56.639
Otherwise…

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.120
Don't blame me if I expose Lin Can's past.

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:12.639
It's getting late.

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:13.639
I should go.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.120
Stay.

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:17.959
I don't want to be alone.

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:20.839
Sit.

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:26.079
You…

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.600
Um…

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.920
It's late.

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:32.279
You should go.

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:33.959
I'm a bit tired.

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:35.920
How did you get this?

00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:38.639
I told you, it's none of your business.

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:39.879
Tell me.

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:43.479
The pressure in the
entertainment industry is high.

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:46.439
Big-shot agent…

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.120
Don't you know the basics?

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.120
Jiang Wan.

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:53.319
Didn't you say…

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.040
You've been doing well all these years?

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:25.639
You're back?

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.800
You didn't answer my calls.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.560
You should've told me, I'd pick you up.

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:31.759
Si Han.

00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:33.759
Let's break up.

00:08:36.473 --> 00:08:37.553
What are you talking about?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.200
We were fine!

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.000
Si Han, can't you grow up?

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.080
I was just playing around with you.

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:48.279
Playing around?

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:50.879
I don't believe you.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.759
Look, I even printed our photos.

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:01.120
My acting really is terrible.

00:09:01.879 --> 00:09:03.320
Even my fake smile is so obvious.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Why?

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:10.639
Give me a reason.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Simple.

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:14.559
At first…

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.679
I thought you were fun.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.159
After all…

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.240
I've never dated a girl before.

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:24.159
And now?

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.679
I'm getting bored of this cheap taste.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Say that again.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.840
Obviously…

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.200
You didn't really think I'd stay
in this dump with you forever, did you?

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:42.039
You and I…

00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:44.440
Were never from the same world.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.840
Besides…

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:51.240
After dating you, I realized…

00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:53.159
I don't actually like women.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.840
Then go.

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:01.359
Let's not contact each other anymore.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.240
Si Han.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.320
Go.

00:10:14.159 --> 00:10:15.159
Just go!

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.080
Si Han.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.600
Why did you lie to me again?

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:49.519
I didn't.

00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:52.799
Jiang Wan.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.680
I'll ask you one more time.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.360
That night…

00:11:58.045 --> 00:11:59.525
Was what you told me true?

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.440
Back then…

00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:06.519
My dad found out about us.

00:12:08.799 --> 00:12:09.799
So…

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:11.159
He forced you…

00:12:20.159 --> 00:12:21.159
The Jiang family…

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:23.320
How did it produce a disgrace like you?

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.879
Cut ties with her immediately.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.480
Or you know…

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.279
What will happen to her.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.960
No.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
He…

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.679
He just gave me a choice.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.320
He said…

00:12:50.879 --> 00:12:52.840
If I was willing to break up with you…

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.120
He'd let me enter the
entertainment industry.

00:12:57.639 --> 00:12:59.480
So you chose to ditch me, the burden?

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:02.360
It wasn't like that.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:05.559
Never mind.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.120
It's fine.

00:13:06.799 --> 00:13:07.639
Just tell me…

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.039
What happened to your hand?

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:25.679
Si Han.

00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:29.399
Si Han.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.360
When it hurts…

00:13:31.759 --> 00:13:33.080
I won't think about you.

00:14:03.039 --> 00:14:04.039
This?

00:14:04.335 --> 00:14:05.935
Pressure in this industry is high.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.960
You know how it is.

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:08.679
And now…

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.720
You're back with me.

00:14:11.799 --> 00:14:12.799
I'm happy.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.480
Hello?

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:42.120
Yes, I'm Lin Can's agent.

00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:50.799
Okay.

00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:52.360
I'll head over now.

00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:54.600
Stay and sleep a bit longer with me.

00:14:57.072 --> 00:14:58.672
I have to deal with Lin Can's situation.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.600
Lin Can.

00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:01.879
Lin Can again.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.960
Do you even care about me?

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.080
Jiang Wan.

00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:10.080
After Lin Can's issues are resolved…

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.120
I'll resign from the company.

00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:14.399
From now on…

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Let's not see each other.

00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:17.440
What do you mean?

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.320
Then…

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.919
What were these past few days about?

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:23.679
They were…

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.159
Mutual convenience.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.120
Miss Jiang…

00:15:29.879 --> 00:15:31.839
Never thought you'd be
the one getting used, huh?

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.440
Si Han.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.680
Why are you treating me like this?

00:16:16.159 --> 00:16:17.159
Nuan Nuan.

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:34.759
Have you seen the hot searches?

00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:36.480
They're exposing Lin Can as gay.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.038
That's not news.

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:39.120
Wasn't that exposed before?

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.799
Not that old one.

00:16:40.879 --> 00:16:42.239
This time it's with her assistant.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.440
Her assistant even
publicly posted about it.

00:16:43.441 --> 00:16:44.816
I always thought there was
something off about Lin Can.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.399
Turns out it's true.

00:16:45.399 --> 00:16:45.720
Really?

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:46.959
Disgusting.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.278
What *isn't* in the entertainment industry?

00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:48.960
Seriously.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.799
What brand would hire a gay person?

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.079
She even curses at elders.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.359
Lin Can is such scum.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.360
Pure bullying of a regular person.

00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:54.441
Don't let her off the hook.

00:17:05.934 --> 00:17:09.014
[Nuannuan received a message
threatening her sexuality being exposed]

00:17:11.006 --> 00:17:12.845
Send me weird stuff again…

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:14.319
And I'll call the police.

00:17:46.839 --> 00:17:47.319
Sorry.

00:17:47.319 --> 00:17:48.319
Watch where you're going.

00:17:54.079 --> 00:17:55.079
This matter…

00:17:55.599 --> 00:17:56.599
You handled it well.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.640
You flatter me, President Shen.

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:00.200
There's one more thing…

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.920
I think you'll be interested in.

00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:03.319
Go on.

00:18:03.839 --> 00:18:04.839
Lin Can's mother…

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.720
Caused trouble outside her old villa.

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:08.399
Got detained by the police.

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:10.359
Lin Can refused to bail her out.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.160
So her mother had to contact Si Han.

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:13.359
What do you think?

00:18:13.599 --> 00:18:14.920
Should I handle it?

00:18:20.319 --> 00:18:22.079
If a family member of
Lin Can is in trouble…

00:18:22.119 --> 00:18:23.400
I can't just stand by.

00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:27.079
Make sure you get to
her before Si Han does.

00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:28.359
Understood.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.119
Want Si Han back by your side?

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.880
Come see me.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.346
I have a gift for you.

00:18:39.371 --> 00:18:40.411
[He's messaging Jiang Wan]

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Still not answering.

00:19:29.599 --> 00:19:30.599
Lin Can.

00:19:36.359 --> 00:19:37.359
Why?

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.240
Why would you do this?

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.759
I don't know what happened.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.440
Listen to me.

00:19:44.839 --> 00:19:46.039
It's not what you think.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.440
You don't know?

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.519
The IP address traces back to you.

00:19:52.839 --> 00:19:54.319
And you're telling me you don't know?

00:19:56.079 --> 00:19:57.079
Wen Nuan Nuan.

00:19:57.839 --> 00:19:59.759
Was it fun playing with my feelings?

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:00.880
You...

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.279
You're hurting me.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.440
Let go.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.680
I get it now.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.000
No wonder your aunt kept showing up.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.240
Back then…

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.400
They got compensation money…

00:20:13.599 --> 00:20:14.880
Because of us.

00:20:16.079 --> 00:20:17.079
What?

00:20:17.119 --> 00:20:18.558
So your family needs money again?

00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:19.200
Is that it?

00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:20.679
Need money for a house?

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.039
Or for your brother's wedding?

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.400
Lin Can.

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:28.720
So in your heart…

00:20:29.839 --> 00:20:30.920
That's who I am.

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:09.119
Don't pull me.

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:14.839
Hurry up.

00:21:15.559 --> 00:21:16.559
Where's Xiao He?

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.279
Where's my Xiao He?

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.400
President Shen.

00:21:37.519 --> 00:21:39.079
We've picked her up and settled her in.

00:21:39.559 --> 00:21:40.200
And…

00:21:40.279 --> 00:21:42.119
She revealed some
things about Lin Can's past.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.040
But this is just her mother's side.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.240
Might not be the whole truth.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.839
Alright, alright, alright.

00:21:59.519 --> 00:22:01.239
That old woman still had this card to play.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.720
Remember.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.160
The truth doesn't matter.

00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:08.959
The public only cares
about what interests them.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.559
This is enough to ruin Lin Can.

00:22:13.519 --> 00:22:14.519
That's all we need.

00:22:15.799 --> 00:22:16.799
Also…

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.680
Keep an eye on her.

00:22:20.079 --> 00:22:21.720
Don't let Lin Can or Si Han find her.

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:22.960
Yes, sir.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.280
Don't worry, President Shen.

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:27.759
Lin Can, oh Lin Can.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.880
You, a high and mighty star…

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:34.599
What would people think
if they knew your story?

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.640
Wouldn't that be a surprise?

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Miss Jiang.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.359
Finally here, Miss Jiang.

00:22:47.839 --> 00:22:48.559
What is it?

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.640
All this secrecy.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.359
Did you see the news yesterday…

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.720
About Lin Can and her assistant?

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.038
Top of the trending list.

00:23:00.039 --> 00:23:01.039
Shocking the industry.

00:23:01.319 --> 00:23:02.319
Hard to miss.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
What?

00:23:05.519 --> 00:23:06.519
You leaked it?

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.880
What's done in the dark…

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.160
Comes to light.

00:23:10.359 --> 00:23:11.920
I just gave them a little push.

00:23:12.079 --> 00:23:13.960
Using someone's private life for drama…

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.440
You're truly despicable.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.880
Thank you for the compliment, Miss Jiang.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.440
But there's more.

00:23:21.359 --> 00:23:23.319
I have a still bigger gift for her.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.480
Not my business.

00:23:25.599 --> 00:23:26.599
Not interested.

00:23:27.119 --> 00:23:28.119
Is that so?

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.720
Don't forget, Miss Jiang…

00:23:33.486 --> 00:23:35.206
We're on the same boat now.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.200
Shen Hao.

00:23:38.359 --> 00:23:39.359
What do you mean?

00:23:40.319 --> 00:23:41.599
Did you forget, Miss Jiang…

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.775
When I embezzled funds
from Star Entertainment…

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:45.919
It was you who provided the money…

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.559
To clean up my mess.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.880
Helped me escape.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.839
So I could frame Lin Can for you.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.920
That's a lie.

00:23:53.279 --> 00:23:55.640
I just agreed to help with
funds and lent you money.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.520
Lin Can's situation has
nothing to do with me.

00:23:57.839 --> 00:23:58.839
Really?

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.680
Miss Jiang.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.960
Take a look.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.560
Why are you showing me this?

00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:15.359
Lin Can's father went to
prison before she was born.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.240
Her mother's a drunk.

00:24:18.759 --> 00:24:19.759
And she herself…

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.480
Is a slut who seduced her stepfather.

00:24:23.319 --> 00:24:24.479
What nonsense are you saying?

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.799
Lin Can's mother said it herself.

00:24:34.519 --> 00:24:35.519
Last night…

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.640
Her mom got detained.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.440
Wanted her daughter to bail her out.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.160
Little did she know…

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.960
Her daughter can't even save herself.

00:24:45.319 --> 00:24:46.599
Lucky for her…

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.519
I sent someone to pick her up.

00:24:49.079 --> 00:24:50.319
This has nothing to do with me.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.720
Doesn't it?

00:25:20.359 --> 00:25:21.759
Jiang Wan, oh Jiang Wan.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.279
Never thought…

00:25:25.451 --> 00:25:26.480
You were gay too.

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:28.359
Do you think…

00:25:28.759 --> 00:25:29.359
Your father…

00:25:29.359 --> 00:25:30.240
Chairman Jiang…

00:25:30.319 --> 00:25:31.480
Would let Si Han off easily…

00:25:32.599 --> 00:25:33.839
If he found out?

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.440
And…

00:25:37.233 --> 00:25:38.993
If I tell Si Han about this…

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.920
Do you think…

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.640
She'd believe…

00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:45.039
You had nothing to do with it?

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.839
You dare threaten me?

00:25:51.119 --> 00:25:52.279
Don't get angry.

00:25:53.519 --> 00:25:54.558
Just cooperate…

00:25:54.559 --> 00:25:55.839
And help me with one last thing.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.920
None of this will happen.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.480
You'll remain the esteemed Miss Jiang.

00:26:00.599 --> 00:26:01.919
Si Han will be back by your side.

00:26:02.759 --> 00:26:03.759
What do you want?

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.680
Simple.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.920
I need you…

00:26:08.319 --> 00:26:09.279
To "accidentally" reveal…

00:26:09.319 --> 00:26:10.559
To the media…

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.759
That you knew about
Lin Can and her assistant…

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:15.039
And also…

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.519
Her sordid past.

00:26:50.214 --> 00:26:51.494
(Seven missed
calls from Lin Can)

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.200
(Easter egg)

00:27:11.799 --> 00:27:12.799
What did you say?

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.200
Her aunt took her away?

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.559
Honey…

00:27:16.759 --> 00:27:17.759
Calm down.

00:27:17.799 --> 00:27:18.440
That brat…

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.319
Good riddance.

00:27:19.656 --> 00:27:20.886
She was always a burden.

00:27:21.799 --> 00:27:22.519
I'll give you…

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.880
A fat baby boy.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:24.920
Then…

00:27:25.119 --> 00:27:26.119
Our family of three…

00:27:26.279 --> 00:27:27.279
Will live happily.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.200
Get out!

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:36.079
You think I want your old face?

00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:38.839
Tomorrow…
at the Civil Affairs Bureau.
