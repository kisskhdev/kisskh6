over his plate on his way down

They died young, right?

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.981
A little after they married, Maddie found out
Dash had been cheating on her from day one,

00:06:20.147 --> 00:06:23.427
and in a fit of heartbreak, she took her
own life with an overdose of secobarbital.

and broke his neck.

00:08:52.133 --> 00:08:56.037
Guy had electricians, pest control,
plumbers, everyone checked this place out.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.173
Okay, Danny was hearing things
that go bump in the night,

00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:00.674
but we know it wasn't a ghost.

00:09:00.808 --> 00:09:03.144
I think somebody
who knew Danny had a bad heart,

00:09:03.277 --> 00:09:04.979
staged a haunting to scare him to death.

00:09:05.813 --> 00:09:06.981
That would be murder.

00:09:07.114 --> 00:09:08.883
All this witchy stuff is not Danny's style.

00:09:09.016 --> 00:09:10.851
Somebody had to help him set it up.

00:09:10.985 --> 00:09:13.387
And someone who could stop a
haunt might be able to fake one.

00:09:13.522 --> 00:09:15.356
Danny's phone is password-protected.

00:09:15.489 --> 00:09:17.324
It's gonna take TID some time to crack it.

00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:22.163
Oz, any of those invoices over there have
something to do with ghost remediation?

00:09:22.329 --> 00:09:23.798
- [Oz] Um...
- [papers rustle]

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.736
No. But there is this.

00:09:33.508 --> 00:09:35.619
[Karadec] And just for my file,
the full name is Calliope...

00:09:35.643 --> 00:09:36.811
[Calliope] Just Calliope.

00:09:37.344 --> 00:09:39.080
I knew something felt off today.

00:09:40.181 --> 00:09:42.192
What was the nature of your
relationship with Mr. Sternblatt?

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:44.185
Verbena? It's good for stress.

00:09:44.351 --> 00:09:47.254
Oh, thank you. We got our fill
at the crime scene.

00:09:48.022 --> 00:09:49.890
I was Danny's spiritual advisor.

00:09:50.024 --> 00:09:53.227
He was raised in a traditional faith
and never really connected with it.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.598
So when he reached a crossroads in
life, he preferred to ask the universe.

00:09:57.731 --> 00:09:59.233
Spiritual, not religious.

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:00.734
Would you mind?

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:03.871
We did a very difficult reading
for a client this morning.

00:10:04.004 --> 00:10:05.372
We need time to ground.

00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:08.676
What sort of crossroads
did you talk about with Danny?

00:10:08.776 --> 00:10:12.713
Business, mostly. Managing his
law firm, sometimes investments.

00:10:12.847 --> 00:10:14.583
Investments like buying
the Spencer house?

00:10:14.715 --> 00:10:16.315
[Calliope] Especially the Spencer house.

00:10:16.383 --> 00:10:18.986
He wouldn't sleep there until
I performed a clearing ritual,

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.956
but it was his wife's dream
of dream houses.

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:24.258
Sadly, the work I performed
there didn't last.

00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:26.794
After Lorraine left,
something dark welled up.

00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:30.297
So you're the one who helped him set
up all those protective elements, right?

00:10:30.431 --> 00:10:32.633
- Have you been in the house?
- Mm-hmm.

00:10:32.766 --> 00:10:36.605
So you felt the cold spot in the
basement? Heard the crying woman?

00:10:36.737 --> 00:10:38.939
- Mmm.
- Can't say that we have. Where was this?

00:10:39.073 --> 00:10:41.576
In the butler's pantry.
Well, that's where I heard her.

00:10:41.742 --> 00:10:44.912
Danny heard her at the same time
in the sitting room across the house.

00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:47.448
The energy in that place is very off.

00:10:47.582 --> 00:10:50.651
Yeah. Hey, how much do each
of these clearing rituals cost?

00:10:50.784 --> 00:10:52.119
Around 5,000.

00:10:52.253 --> 00:10:54.255
- Dollars?
- Yes. Why?

00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:55.990
Uh... I need a minute to ground.

00:10:56.123 --> 00:10:58.792
What my partner's saying is it
seems you caught yourself a whale.

00:10:58.926 --> 00:11:01.495
Danny was terrified and
more than willing to shell out.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.550
[chuckles] - Yeah, and
these rituals didn't work,

00:11:03.598 --> 00:11:05.332
but you knew that, didn't you?

00:11:05.466 --> 00:11:09.670
This green candle over here, you got
it just drenched in bergamot and myrtle.

00:11:09.803 --> 00:11:11.672
That's an abundance spell, right?

00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:14.108
Only typically those are done
during a waxing moon,

00:11:14.241 --> 00:11:15.610
and right now the moon's waning.

00:11:15.776 --> 00:11:17.111
You know your stuff.

00:11:20.447 --> 00:11:23.184
Ah. My cleaning lady
must have flipped that.

00:11:23.317 --> 00:11:26.453
Oh. Yeah. Yeah,
I think I do know my stuff.

00:11:26.555 --> 00:11:30.625
I also know that a woman who refers
to herself and her tarot deck as "we,"

00:11:30.758 --> 00:11:34.663
doesn't need to consult a calendar
to find out the moon phases.

00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:36.631
- You calling me a fraud?
- I am.

00:11:36.797 --> 00:11:38.108
[Karadec] So, Calliope, what happened?

00:11:38.132 --> 00:11:39.534
Did Danny catch on to your scam?

00:11:39.668 --> 00:11:41.278
Cut off the funds,
so you scared him to death?

00:11:41.302 --> 00:11:42.970
[chuckles] No, why would I do that?

00:11:43.137 --> 00:11:46.140
My entire business would collapse if
people found out my clients were dying.

00:11:46.307 --> 00:11:47.841
Now, unless I am under arrest,

00:11:47.975 --> 00:11:50.444
please leave and take your
closed hearts with you.

00:11:50.545 --> 00:11:52.112
This is a sacred space.

00:11:52.213 --> 00:11:54.181
This is a bungalow in El Segundo.

00:11:54.315 --> 00:11:55.684
Morgan, let's go.

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:58.352
If you don't believe the
Spencer house is haunted, fine.

00:11:58.485 --> 00:12:00.187
But the things I told you did happen,

00:12:00.321 --> 00:12:04.659
so perhaps focus less on me
and look into what caused them.

00:12:12.299 --> 00:12:13.801
What? She put me in a bad mood.

00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:16.170
- When were you in a good mood?
- I'm a delight.

00:12:16.337 --> 00:12:18.348
Well, fraud or no fraud,
Calliope made a good point.

00:12:18.372 --> 00:12:20.572
It wasn't in her best interest
to kill her golden goose.

00:12:20.675 --> 00:12:22.052
And she gave us specifics we can use.

00:12:22.076 --> 00:12:24.679
A cold spot in the basement,
a woman crying.

00:12:24.845 --> 00:12:27.014
Someone planted those scares
to freak Sternblatt out.

00:12:27.181 --> 00:12:28.781
And maybe they left
some evidence behind.

Uh, great. If you like spiders.

00:13:35.717 --> 00:13:38.787
Otherwise, not much to report. You?

00:13:38.952 --> 00:13:41.155
Just a rat, cute little guy or gal.

Morgan?

00:13:49.096 --> 00:13:52.634
Calliope said
that they heard a woman crying

00:13:52.767 --> 00:13:54.803
in two different parts of the house, right?

00:13:55.603 --> 00:14:01.108

- Morgan?
- Mm-hmm.

I think you're gonna want to see this.

00:14:56.163 --> 00:14:57.164
Morgan, where are you?

00:14:57.331 --> 00:14:58.733
What's going on? Just tell me.

00:16:00.628 --> 00:16:05.232

today, mostly by just standing there,

Is the furniture small?

00:18:41.756 --> 00:18:43.256
No, you're big.

00:18:45.593 --> 00:18:49.097
Guess the world wasn't built
for people my size, huh?

00:18:50.098 --> 00:18:53.901
Anyway, it's Khurmi.
K-H-U-R-M-I. Twenty-seven.

00:18:54.035 --> 00:18:57.471
Special effects wiz.
Electrical engineering. Oh.

00:18:58.238 --> 00:18:59.807
Cal Arts grad. Wow.

00:18:59.941 --> 00:19:03.310
- I've asked for a lawyer.
- Yes, I heard, as is your right.

00:19:03.443 --> 00:19:06.948
It's just that this release is
gonna go out before they get here,

00:19:07.081 --> 00:19:09.059
so I thought I'd give you
a chance to correct the error.

00:19:09.083 --> 00:19:10.918
So it is true.
New cap's doing the interview.

00:19:11.052 --> 00:19:12.086
Mm-hmm.

00:19:12.252 --> 00:19:13.721
Mind if I watch?

00:19:15.255 --> 00:19:16.958
Knock yourself out.

00:19:17.091 --> 00:19:21.596
You know, I won't lie. Lawyers hate
these releases. Court of public opinion.

00:19:21.729 --> 00:19:25.800
Once we tell the world you're a killer,
good luck convincing a jury otherwise.

00:19:25.933 --> 00:19:28.002
But we're just gonna go
with what we know.

00:19:28.136 --> 00:19:30.303
You applied your skills
to stage a high-tech haunt

00:19:30.437 --> 00:19:31.572
spanning a matter of months.

00:19:31.673 --> 00:19:33.173
You used your fancy toys

00:19:33.306 --> 00:19:37.779
and an inspired cameo as
the ghost of Maddie St. Croix

00:19:37.912 --> 00:19:39.479
that led to the death of Danny.

00:19:40.081 --> 00:19:42.984
You killed him. And then you
saw those kids at the window.

00:19:43.117 --> 00:19:44.757
You knew the cops
were coming then, right?

00:19:44.852 --> 00:19:46.521
At least that's the story now.

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:50.925
But you know, I know you have
a lot of student debt,

00:19:51.025 --> 00:19:55.129
and I also can't tie you to Sternblatt,
which means someone paid you.

00:19:55.663 --> 00:19:56.998
Shawna, give me their name,

00:19:57.799 --> 00:19:59.967
and this press release disappears.

00:20:00.635 --> 00:20:02.103
You don't get labeled a killer

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:04.772
and this whole thing
comes grinding to a halt.

00:20:04.872 --> 00:20:06.174
[Oz chuckles]

00:20:07.809 --> 00:20:09.010
Help me help you.

00:20:11.512 --> 00:20:13.123
I tried to save him, but I don't know CPR,

00:20:13.147 --> 00:20:14.792
and she never told me
about his heart condition.

00:20:14.816 --> 00:20:16.150
She who?

00:20:16.316 --> 00:20:17.852
Danny's wife, Lorraine.

00:20:22.355 --> 00:20:23.825
Wow, that's, uh

00:20:24.491 --> 00:20:27.227
[clears throat] that's good. It's good work.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.863
Sure, but he still could've told us.

00:20:29.997 --> 00:20:32.142
- Lorraine back in town yet?
- She should've just landed.

00:20:32.166 --> 00:20:34.478
She did say something about
having to stop by her office first

00:20:34.502 --> 00:20:35.636
before coming to see us.

00:20:35.737 --> 00:20:37.457
Then have Karadec and Morgan
meet her there.

00:20:37.538 --> 00:20:39.073
I think she'll squeeze us in.

00:20:43.544 --> 00:20:45.689
[person] I'm just trying to
make sure you're taken care of.

00:20:45.713 --> 00:20:49.650
No, you're not. You're trying to
make sure you're taken care of.

00:20:49.751 --> 00:20:52.186
You always loved that house
more than you loved my dad.

00:20:55.489 --> 00:20:58.258
Excuse me. LAPD.

00:20:59.527 --> 00:21:01.896
Did you just say
Danny Sternblatt was your dad?

00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:04.098
Yeah, I'm Paloma Nichols.

00:21:04.232 --> 00:21:05.533
I'm really sorry for your loss.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.544
It doesn't sound like Lorraine
in there is your mom?

00:21:07.568 --> 00:21:10.705
[scoffs] Dad's second wife.
He and my mom split ages ago.

00:21:11.706 --> 00:21:14.242
Wait, do you think Lorraine had
something to do with his death?

00:21:14.374 --> 00:21:15.877
It's too soon to comment.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:18.411
[sighs] I wouldn't put it past her.

00:21:18.546 --> 00:21:21.682
She invited me here
to supposedly make peace.

00:21:22.216 --> 00:21:24.018
Really, she wanted
to feel out my intentions.

00:21:24.118 --> 00:21:25.887
My dad's body isn't even cold yet.

00:21:26.754 --> 00:21:29.557
Uh, sorry, Ms. Nichols, we may
have some questions for you too.

00:21:29.724 --> 00:21:32.392
- Is there any way we can reach you?
- Yeah.

00:21:32.527 --> 00:21:35.263
It's Dr. Nichols. Here's all my info.

00:21:36.264 --> 00:21:38.431
When you are ready to comment,
I'd love to hear it.

00:21:38.566 --> 00:21:41.468
[Lorraine] Jody, I'm wiped.
I'm gonna head home.

00:21:41.602 --> 00:21:43.638
Hey, if the, uh, police call again,

00:21:43.771 --> 00:21:46.073
let them know
I'll go there in the morning.

00:21:47.074 --> 00:21:48.242
Saved you the trip.

00:21:50.244 --> 00:21:52.613
Ms. Khurmi identified you by name.

00:21:52.747 --> 00:21:54.627
Says you met when you spoke
at a class she took,

00:21:54.749 --> 00:21:57.652
and a few months later, you
approached her for help with a haunting

00:21:57.785 --> 00:22:00.021
and offered her a job
at your firm in exchange.

00:22:00.154 --> 00:22:03.257
Shawna says she had no idea about
Danny's heart, and we believe her.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.293
The problem is you did know,

00:22:05.425 --> 00:22:08.105
because he'd had a previous heart
attack when you guys were married.

00:22:09.263 --> 00:22:10.463
I knew.

00:22:11.766 --> 00:22:13.301
His recovery was the last time

00:22:13.433 --> 00:22:15.803
I can remember us being good
to each other.

00:22:16.771 --> 00:22:19.173
So it sounds like you did
love each other at one point.

00:22:19.307 --> 00:22:20.908
Yeah, I mean, I...

00:22:22.677 --> 00:22:26.080
He used to write me
these letters all the time.

00:22:27.849 --> 00:22:32.620
We were one of history's great
couples, like Dash and Maddie.

00:22:33.254 --> 00:22:36.524
Until Danny started acting a little too
much like Dash and cheated on you.

00:22:36.657 --> 00:22:37.992
I was devastated.

00:22:39.627 --> 00:22:44.699
And then when I decided that I had
enough, he used every trick against me.

00:22:44.832 --> 00:22:48.669
He changed locks while I was
traveling, swore I'd never get the house.

00:22:49.303 --> 00:22:51.205
It was all about winning.

00:22:51.339 --> 00:22:54.484
So you decided to play dirty too and used
his superstitions to get what you wanted.

00:22:54.508 --> 00:22:56.878
[sighs] Listen, I know that it went too far,

00:22:57.678 --> 00:23:00.181
but I never wanted to kill him.

00:23:00.314 --> 00:23:01.682
I just wanted the house.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.720
I mean, I figured if I spooked him
enough, he would just sign it over.

00:23:07.487 --> 00:23:11.659
Wait, you met his daughter
on her way out.

00:23:11.826 --> 00:23:15.329
The house was in Danny's name.
He... He left it to her.

00:23:15.495 --> 00:23:16.831
She would inherit the house.

00:23:16.964 --> 00:23:20.034
You needed him to give it over
to you while he was alive.

00:23:21.202 --> 00:23:22.402
Yeah, well...

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:27.208
Doesn't change the fact that he's
dead and I have to live with that.

00:23:30.378 --> 00:23:32.914
Wait, is this Danny's handwriting?

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.880
Oh, this doesn't look anything
like the letters at the house.

00:23:37.484 --> 00:23:41.355
That writing was really messy,
shaky, like his hands were weak.

00:23:41.522 --> 00:23:44.025
Also, I think he was off-balance.

00:23:44.725 --> 00:23:47.161
Poor guy was stumbling all
over the place like the undead.

00:23:47.828 --> 00:23:50.031
Karadec, I think we've gotta
check those sleeping pills.

00:23:50.197 --> 00:23:51.917
I'll have the ME fast-track his tox report.

00:23:52.033 --> 00:23:53.701
[stutters] Wait, what's going on?

00:23:54.568 --> 00:23:57.605
You could have scared Danny
to death, but I don't think you did.

00:24:00.241 --> 00:24:01.542
I think he was poisoned.

00:24:04.578 --> 00:24:06.213
Lab reports are back.

00:24:07.014 --> 00:24:08.382
Those weren't sleeping pills.

00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:11.953
Danny Sternblatt died from
a potassium chloride overdose

00:24:12.086 --> 00:24:13.955
which induced a fatal heart attack.

00:24:14.088 --> 00:24:15.768
ME said it was a smart way
to kill someone.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.893
Potassium chloride spikes
naturally in the blood after death.

00:24:19.026 --> 00:24:20.337
Autopsy never would've caught it.

00:24:20.361 --> 00:24:22.296
Which means if we
hadn't tested those pills,

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:25.190
Lorraine Sternblatt would've gone
down for a murder she didn't commit.

00:24:25.232 --> 00:24:26.767
Solid catch by Morgan.

00:24:26.901 --> 00:24:29.741
So, someone knew the wife was
gaslighting Danny and piggybacked on that,

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.273
making it look
like she haunted him to death.

00:24:32.406 --> 00:24:34.141
- Who?
- Had to be someone close to him,

00:24:34.275 --> 00:24:35.595
someone with access to the pills.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.187
You take a closer look at the daughter?

00:24:37.211 --> 00:24:39.389
Paloma will get the house, but
the money motive feels weak.

00:24:39.413 --> 00:24:42.125
I mean, she's an orthopedic surgeon
married to another orthopedic surgeon.

00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:43.417
She's fine.

00:24:44.085 --> 00:24:47.254
What about Sternblatt's practice?
Didn't the wife say he was tough as nails?

00:24:47.355 --> 00:24:49.275
Yeah, said he used
every nasty trick in the book.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:50.670
Even came up with some new ones.

00:24:50.791 --> 00:24:53.260
Maybe a divorcé he did
a number on wanted revenge?

00:24:53.427 --> 00:24:55.507
Or maybe a rival lawyer.
We'll head over to his firm.

00:24:55.563 --> 00:24:57.598
If the guy had enemies
over there, we'll find out.

00:24:59.333 --> 00:25:00.935
- He was murdered?
- Mmm.

00:25:01.102 --> 00:25:03.971
Oh, my God. I figured
his heart just gave out.

00:25:04.105 --> 00:25:08.009
Were you aware Mr. Sternblatt
thought that his house was, um, haunted?

00:25:08.743 --> 00:25:10.511
He made it impossible not to know.

00:25:11.112 --> 00:25:15.082
Danny was freaking everyone out, that
woo-woo bracelet, jumping at shadows.

00:25:15.182 --> 00:25:17.485
We're wondering if anyone he
went up against with in court

00:25:17.618 --> 00:25:19.763
might've known that too and
used that knowledge against him.

00:25:19.787 --> 00:25:21.522
[scoffs] I wish.

00:25:22.323 --> 00:25:24.525
Well, I'm sorry.
[stammers] That came out wrong.

00:25:24.658 --> 00:25:27.495
I just meant that Danny wasn't
in court anytime recently.

00:25:27.628 --> 00:25:31.132
He was too wrapped up in his own
divorce and winning that damn house.

00:25:31.298 --> 00:25:33.010
He handed off all his other
cases months ago,

00:25:33.034 --> 00:25:35.202
stopped coming in at all
the last few weeks.

00:25:37.004 --> 00:25:38.639
Look, I was worried about my friend.

00:25:44.678 --> 00:25:45.679
Wouldn't you be?

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.482
Have at it. I have to call my wife.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.157
Huh. Well, sounds like Sternblatt
wasn't making any enemies here.

00:25:56.323 --> 00:25:58.492
- Took himself completely off the board.
- Mm-hmm.

00:25:59.226 --> 00:26:01.629
Feels like all roads keep leading
back to the Spencer house.

00:26:02.997 --> 00:26:05.277
What do you say we give
Daphne's ghost theory another run?

00:26:06.801 --> 00:26:08.402
I just do not get this guy.

00:26:08.537 --> 00:26:10.838
I mean, digging in
out of spite, that's one thing,

00:26:11.005 --> 00:26:13.007
but Sternblatt hated the house.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.209
He wasn't sleeping.
He knew he had a bad heart.

00:26:15.342 --> 00:26:17.988
At a certain point, you would think,
that the fear of having a heart attack

00:26:18.012 --> 00:26:19.713
would override the desire
to win a divorce.

00:26:19.847 --> 00:26:21.415
[phone buzzing]

00:26:22.883 --> 00:26:24.685
You're missing out, Gillory.

00:26:24.819 --> 00:26:27.859
It looks like one of your crime boards
exploded all over our victim's office.

00:26:28.022 --> 00:26:31.158
Only in every direction it's
nothing but house, house, house.

00:26:31.258 --> 00:26:33.494
- Maybe it is something.
- [Oz] What's that?

00:26:33.594 --> 00:26:37.064
Well, I was doing a little digging around
in the Sternblatt divorce documents

00:26:37.198 --> 00:26:40.267
trying to find something that would
pop out as a motive to kill Danny.

00:26:40.401 --> 00:26:41.669
- And?
- Nothing popped.

00:26:41.769 --> 00:26:43.647
But then I noticed something
weird about the house.

00:26:43.671 --> 00:26:47.576
The appraisal when they bought it
showed it as 300 square feet smaller

00:26:47.708 --> 00:26:50.579
than it was when it was
appraised in the 1940s.

00:26:50.711 --> 00:26:52.222
I mean, maybe that's a mistake, but...

00:26:52.246 --> 00:26:55.449
No. No, it's here on the blueprints too.

00:26:55.584 --> 00:27:02.022
300-square-foot difference
between the old and the new.

00:27:02.123 --> 00:27:06.427
How could they lose 300 square feet,
but the footprints look exactly the same?

00:27:06.561 --> 00:27:08.629
- It's like there's a...
- Disappearing room?

00:27:08.762 --> 00:27:10.565
I don't think we're done there yet, boys.

00:27:10.698 --> 00:27:13.400
I think the Spencer house has
more secrets to tell.

00:27:13.535 --> 00:27:16.470
And I'm sensing you have
a way of figuring that out?

00:27:29.618 --> 00:27:31.318
He didn't need to straighten that.

00:27:31.452 --> 00:27:34.355
Mind if I ask why you pulled
half my bullpen down here?

00:27:34.488 --> 00:27:36.824
Do you mind if I answer
in the form of a story?

00:27:36.957 --> 00:27:38.969
Don't answer that. It's
happening. It's starting right now.

00:27:38.993 --> 00:27:43.330
Deep in the gloomy glens of ancient
Scotland stands Castle Glamis.

00:27:43.464 --> 00:27:46.934
Legend has it that the heir
of the 11th Earl of Strathmore

00:27:47.101 --> 00:27:50.804
was hidden away in a secret room that
was walled up, never to be seen again.

00:27:50.938 --> 00:27:55.009
But then, a few hundred years later,
there was a new lady of the castle,

00:27:55.142 --> 00:27:57.978
and she set out to find
the infamous hidden chamber.

00:27:58.112 --> 00:28:01.782
This Lady Glamis knew that if a
room had actually been walled up

00:28:01.916 --> 00:28:03.276
that it would still have a window.

00:28:03.317 --> 00:28:04.852
So she asked her ladies-in-waiting

00:28:04.985 --> 00:28:07.488
to tie a handkerchief to
every window they could find.

00:28:08.489 --> 00:28:10.191
And lo and behold,

00:28:10.324 --> 00:28:13.961
only one window remained that
was hanky-free from the outside.

00:28:14.128 --> 00:28:17.031
And that was
how she found the secret room.

00:28:18.332 --> 00:28:19.934
And there it is.

00:28:22.836 --> 00:28:25.139
I'm guessing
this was Lorraine's craft room

00:28:25.306 --> 00:28:26.807
before Danny booted her out.

00:28:27.474 --> 00:28:30.311
Okay, that secret room's gotta
be behind these bookshelves.

00:28:31.278 --> 00:28:32.479
Oh!

00:28:32.947 --> 00:28:35.216
- You see it?
- Why don't you help us see it?

00:28:35.349 --> 00:28:37.519
This panel, it's plain sawn.

00:28:37.652 --> 00:28:39.386
It has to do with how they cut the lumber.

00:28:39.521 --> 00:28:41.965
These shelves are all quarter
sawn, so is the rest of the house,

00:28:41.989 --> 00:28:44.358
but this panel is plain sawn.

00:28:44.491 --> 00:28:46.994
Maybe Danny broke that panel
when he was tearing this place up

00:28:47.161 --> 00:28:50.130
and then repaired it,
but why only make the one fix?

00:28:50.231 --> 00:28:51.298
[screaming]

00:29:10.017 --> 00:29:11.586
Mmm. Maybe to hide this?

00:29:16.691 --> 00:29:18.859
This is Maddie's old boudoir.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.429
Oh, and that hat, that's the
hat that she wore to the premiere

00:29:22.564 --> 00:29:24.398
of the last film she made with Dash.

00:29:24.532 --> 00:29:28.269
Can I try a couple of these things on
before they get shipped off to some museum?

00:29:28.402 --> 00:29:30.237
- They're evidence.
- I'll be careful.

00:29:30.371 --> 00:29:33.774
So we think this room's been
tucked away for 70-plus years?

00:29:33.907 --> 00:29:36.678
Well, Maddie took her own life.
Dash must have walled it up.

00:29:36.777 --> 00:29:39.055
Probably because his conscience
couldn't handle any reminders

00:29:39.079 --> 00:29:40.423
of the woman he'd driven to suicide.

00:29:40.447 --> 00:29:42.216
[Daphne] Check out this gem.

00:29:42.349 --> 00:29:45.228
This room might've never been found if
Lorraine hadn't started haunting Danny.

00:29:45.252 --> 00:29:48.922
This room is part of history. Why would
Danny want to hide that from the world?

00:29:49.056 --> 00:29:51.892
Well, the same reason he didn't
leave when he started being haunted.

00:29:52.026 --> 00:29:54.128
Gotta be something in here
worth sticking around for.

00:29:54.261 --> 00:29:55.362
Like this?

00:29:56.096 --> 00:29:59.066
- Oh, yeah, that would do it.
- Speaking of gems.

00:29:59.233 --> 00:30:00.833
It's the only thing not covered in dust.

00:30:00.868 --> 00:30:03.380
There is a rumor that when Maddie
caught Dash with his mistress,

00:30:03.404 --> 00:30:05.640
he tried to make it up to her
with a diamond necklace.

00:30:05.774 --> 00:30:07.551
- If those diamonds are real...
- They're real.

00:30:07.575 --> 00:30:09.043
They'd be worth enough to kill for.

00:30:16.751 --> 00:30:18.986
Hey, want some of this?

00:30:20.087 --> 00:30:21.790
I figure we deserve a little unwind

00:30:21.922 --> 00:30:24.626
while we wait to see if that
necklace you found is real.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:29.830
Root beer on an unprotected
lip? You're a madman.

00:30:31.231 --> 00:30:33.267
- I'll take it slow.
- Did I shame you into that?

00:30:33.434 --> 00:30:34.968
No, no, it was time.

00:30:35.102 --> 00:30:36.782
All winning streaks
have to come to an end.

00:30:36.937 --> 00:30:38.305
Is that what we're calling it?

00:30:38.439 --> 00:30:39.774
It's okay. I'll take the can.

00:30:41.676 --> 00:30:43.812
Hey, you a Dash and Maddie fan?

00:30:44.478 --> 00:30:46.447
- Mmm.
- Yeah, I was.

00:30:46.614 --> 00:30:48.783
Little disappointed in all the gory details.

00:30:48.949 --> 00:30:51.820
Yeah, this case isn't a ringing
endorsement for marriage.

00:30:52.319 --> 00:30:53.487
Ever been?

00:30:53.621 --> 00:30:55.289
Married? No.

00:30:56.123 --> 00:31:00.595
No. No, I mean, weddings are
great. There's... It's very sweet.

00:31:00.695 --> 00:31:03.163
I get it. [Stammers] I just...

00:31:03.931 --> 00:31:07.968
It's good for people. I just... The whole
courthouse and the paperwork and the

00:31:09.103 --> 00:31:12.973
the permanence of it, you know,
kind of kills the romance.

00:31:18.312 --> 00:31:20.515
- Yeah?
- Oh, just seeing some things.

00:31:20.648 --> 00:31:21.816
I don't think you are.

00:31:21.982 --> 00:31:23.594
- If this was an interrogation...
- It's not though.

00:31:23.618 --> 00:31:25.338
It's not an interrogation, so knock it off.

00:31:25.452 --> 00:31:27.789
- Well, now I know I'm right.
- [laughs]

00:31:28.523 --> 00:31:32.226
Okay. Fine, what things are you seeing?

00:31:32.359 --> 00:31:34.529
Well, first of all, you're
gripping that can so tight,

00:31:34.662 --> 00:31:36.731
I'm worried you're going
to be wearing the soda.

00:31:37.532 --> 00:31:40.901
The neck massage, a little self
soothing, fiddling with the candy.

00:31:41.034 --> 00:31:44.071
Those eyes of yours are jumping
around to everywhere but mine.

00:31:44.204 --> 00:31:47.207
I think the talk of marriage is
making you a little anxious.

00:31:47.341 --> 00:31:48.543
- Okay.
- [chuckles]

00:31:48.676 --> 00:31:52.547
[titters] Yeah, yeah,
I don't like it, you know.

00:31:53.213 --> 00:31:58.385
My brain has a way of making
sure relationships don't last very long,

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.087
so let's just leave it at that.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.389
- Okay.
- What about you?

00:32:02.524 --> 00:32:04.024
Me? Oh.

00:32:04.526 --> 00:32:07.361
I'm into a four-year deal
that's working out pretty well.

00:32:07.529 --> 00:32:09.029
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:32:09.163 --> 00:32:12.700
She understands me, and, for
the most part, I understand her.

00:32:16.571 --> 00:32:18.038

- Ingrid.

00:32:19.874 --> 00:32:22.544
Well, congratulations.
Ingrid seems like a real catch.

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.378
Thank you.

Have you ever married one of those?

Got real close.

00:32:31.218 --> 00:32:32.687
She passed away a few years ago.

00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:35.857
I'm sorry.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:37.792
Yeah, me too.

So it's authentic.

00:33:17.264 --> 00:33:18.475
[Nick] So why was it still there?

00:33:18.499 --> 00:33:20.167
Sternblatt must've ball parked its worth.

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.136
Why didn't he put it in Fort Knox
or try to find a tycoon to buy it?

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:25.105
The guy was a divorce attorney.

00:33:25.272 --> 00:33:27.618
Nobody knew better than him that if
Lorraine found out, she could claim half.

00:33:27.642 --> 00:33:29.887
[Selena] So we're thinking he
opted to leave it behind the wall

00:33:29.911 --> 00:33:31.111
until the divorce was final.

00:33:31.278 --> 00:33:32.847
Anything else would've been too risky.

00:33:32.981 --> 00:33:35.583
Then he could sell it and make
up a story about where he found it.

00:33:35.683 --> 00:33:37.123
But somebody else knew it was there,

00:33:37.184 --> 00:33:39.262
and their plan was to kill
Danny, steal the necklace.

00:33:39.286 --> 00:33:41.355
Until the kids saw Shawna
being Maddie's ghost

00:33:41.488 --> 00:33:45.627
and got us down there so fast, the killer
missed the window to complete the theft.

00:33:45.793 --> 00:33:48.137
The good news is this person
doesn't know we have the necklace,

00:33:48.161 --> 00:33:49.263
so that could be a good...

00:33:54.268 --> 00:33:55.980
[Morgan] I don't think Danny
was sleeping very well.

00:33:56.004 --> 00:33:57.137
I just wanted the house.

00:33:57.839 --> 00:34:00.875

You're trying to make sure
you're taken care of.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.983
You know who did it, don't you?

00:34:09.116 --> 00:34:11.019
- Yeah.
- So?

00:34:11.619 --> 00:34:13.153
So let's give 'em their window.

00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:23.497
Based on evidence uncovered by
detectives in LAPD's Major Crime Squad,

00:34:23.665 --> 00:34:25.700
we have arrested Lorraine Sternblatt

her estranged husband,

That's what I'm not so sure of.
The crossing over.

I went there this morning. The
police released the house to me.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:50.223
Maybe it's all the stress
talking, but I felt him there.

00:34:50.357 --> 00:34:51.926
Well, energy can linger.

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.428
But then he could be in pain, trapped.

00:34:55.362 --> 00:34:58.365
Wait. Could you help him?

00:34:58.533 --> 00:35:02.436
Of course. I would recommend

00:36:16.077 --> 00:36:18.345
and you jumped right on that opportunity.

00:36:18.478 --> 00:36:21.949
You knew somebody else was
already gaslighting this very gullible man.

00:36:22.116 --> 00:36:24.516
How they were doing it didn't
really matter. You didn't care.

00:36:24.619 --> 00:36:27.922
All you needed to do was
draft off of their haunting

00:36:28.022 --> 00:36:29.657
and collect your paychecks.

00:36:29.791 --> 00:36:32.471
Poor Danny trusted you so much
that when he found Maddie's necklace,

00:36:32.527 --> 00:36:34.294
he told you about it, right?

00:36:34.461 --> 00:36:36.840
I mean, after all, he never made a
move in this house without consulting you,

00:36:36.864 --> 00:36:39.504
- and you came up with a plan to kill him.
- [Morgan] That's right.

00:36:40.434 --> 00:36:43.336
You switched out his sleeping
pills for potassium chloride,

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:45.616
and you convinced him to
check in with you every morning

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.010
to discuss all of the creepy things
that happened the evening before.

00:36:49.143 --> 00:36:50.377
You see, we have a tech team.

00:36:50.511 --> 00:36:52.547
They cracked Danny's phone,
and we saw the texts.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.040
So the day you didn't receive one,

00:36:54.148 --> 00:36:56.349
you knew that Danny had
had his coronary event.

00:36:56.483 --> 00:36:59.496
Your plan had worked, you could've just
came back here and swiped the necklace.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.489
But the police got here too fast,
didn't they? Blew your window.

00:37:02.657 --> 00:37:05.860
So we tried to help you out.
We staged an arrest for Lorraine.

00:37:05.993 --> 00:37:08.361
That way Paloma could lure you
back into the house.

00:37:08.495 --> 00:37:12.166
Guess it worked. Happy
Halloween. You're under arrest.

00:37:20.041 --> 00:37:21.075
- Karadec.
- Mm-hmm.

00:37:21.976 --> 00:37:23.845
- Where's the bird?
- Bird?

00:37:24.011 --> 00:37:27.048
Yeah, that giant awesome black
raven that was perched on the clock,

00:37:27.181 --> 00:37:29.483
casting a super creepy shadow
when we first got here.

00:37:29.584 --> 00:37:31.219
Do you remember?

00:37:31.351 --> 00:37:34.031
I guess I was just focused on the
body. Don't know what to tell you.

00:37:43.531 --> 00:37:44.699
[caws]

00:38:06.621 --> 00:38:07.688
[sighs]

00:38:12.927 --> 00:38:14.595
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:38:16.363 --> 00:38:18.099
- I heard you out here.
- You did?

00:38:18.566 --> 00:38:20.400
- It was a very loud sigh.
- Was it?

00:38:21.235 --> 00:38:22.270
[sighs]

00:38:23.104 --> 00:38:24.404
Can I go first?

00:38:25.239 --> 00:38:27.208
- Depends.
- It's all your fault.

00:38:27.307 --> 00:38:28.943
- No, you can't.
- No, no, no, I mean,

00:38:29.977 --> 00:38:31.311
you're mad at a younger you.

00:38:32.947 --> 00:38:37.919
I'm not like you in a lot of ways, but
I'm way too much like you in others.

00:38:39.419 --> 00:38:41.421
Did you always listen to your mom?

00:38:41.522 --> 00:38:42.790
- I-I mean...
- Of course not.

00:38:44.125 --> 00:38:47.460
Makes me think that the 15-year-old
you would've done exactly what I did,

00:38:47.595 --> 00:38:49.764
- because me and you...
- You and I.

00:38:49.931 --> 00:38:51.431
[sighs]

00:38:51.566 --> 00:38:55.770
You and I aren't wired to just
sit by if we want something.

00:38:56.403 --> 00:38:59.106
I mean, there's this guy that might
be able to tell us about my dad,

00:38:59.273 --> 00:39:00.584
and I was supposed to do nothing?

00:39:00.608 --> 00:39:02.577
I know it wasn't the safest thing to do,

00:39:02.677 --> 00:39:04.444
but you guys are going to
our favorite diner.

00:39:04.612 --> 00:39:05.847
I couldn't help myself.

00:39:07.114 --> 00:39:10.017
So I'm sorry I scared you.

00:39:10.618 --> 00:39:12.153
But I'm not sorry that I went.

00:39:13.988 --> 00:39:16.858
Okay, I'm done. Your turn.

00:39:18.926 --> 00:39:21.963
Okay. I accept your non-apology.

00:39:24.131 --> 00:39:26.499
And I'm not sorry
that I put my foot down.

00:39:27.268 --> 00:39:30.171
I can't keep looking for your dad if
it means you're not gonna be safe.

00:39:32.306 --> 00:39:33.786
I-I need you to keep looking for him.

00:39:36.177 --> 00:39:43.050
So if that means I have to
start listening, then I guess I will.

00:39:43.184 --> 00:39:44.986
- [both chuckling]
- There she is.

00:39:47.188 --> 00:39:48.189
I love you so much.

00:39:48.322 --> 00:39:49.724
I love you too, Mom.

00:39:52.126 --> 00:39:54.362
[sighs] So am I still grounded?

00:39:54.494 --> 00:39:56.998
Why don't you ask me the
question you really wanna ask me?

00:39:57.131 --> 00:39:58.900
Can I go to Emma's Halloween party?

00:39:59.033 --> 00:40:01.202
Depends. How
inappropriate is your costume?

00:40:01.335 --> 00:40:04.906
Zombie cheerleader, and
my skirt's longer than yours.

00:40:05.506 --> 00:40:07.842
- That's fair. [Chuckles]
- Can I show you?

00:40:08.009 --> 00:40:11.045
Yes, but I wanna show you
something first. Come here.

00:40:14.715 --> 00:40:17.051
- Is that...
- That's it.

00:40:18.185 --> 00:40:19.220
Have you opened it?

00:40:19.987 --> 00:40:24.191
Yeah. It took me a minute,
but I got there.

00:40:24.992 --> 00:40:27.895
- And?
- I don't know yet.

00:40:28.696 --> 00:40:31.866
I don't know if any of it means
anything or if it's gonna help us find him.

00:40:32.432 --> 00:40:33.500
- Can we?
- Yeah.
