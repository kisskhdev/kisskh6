{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:41.545
It's not poisoned.

00:01:42.705 --> 00:01:44.145
Even if it is poisoned,

00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:45.465
a silver needle can't detect it.

00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:48.185
Your Ladyship,
should we ask for ingredients

00:01:48.265 --> 00:01:49.225
and let me do the cooking?

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:51.625
Poisoned or not,

00:01:51.705 --> 00:01:53.145
we won't know till we taste it.

00:02:01.345 --> 00:02:02.665
You two (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:04.025
are so silly.

00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:07.225
Tasting your food is our duty.

00:02:07.305 --> 00:02:08.864
If something goes wrong,

00:02:08.945 --> 00:02:10.425
we should die before you.

00:02:18.065 --> 00:02:20.825
Just in case,
take one pill morning and night.

00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:21.825
It can save your life.

00:02:21.905 --> 00:02:23.625
Your Ladyship, what about you?

00:02:23.705 --> 00:02:26.905
Save the fruit from each meal.
Store it somewhere cool.

00:02:26.985 --> 00:02:28.265
It'll be useful later.

00:02:34.705 --> 00:02:38.185
PRINCE OF DUAN'S MANOR

00:04:21.985 --> 00:04:23.065
Your Ladyship, what's wrong?

00:04:26.785 --> 00:04:27.985
Your Ladyship!

00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:34.425
Heaven's still on my side.

00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:37.625
Someone's lost their patience.

00:04:37.705 --> 00:04:39.505
I'll get someone to treat you.

00:04:39.585 --> 00:04:40.425
No need!

00:04:41.145 --> 00:04:42.945
How are you and Yuebai?

00:04:43.025 --> 00:04:45.345
Yuebai fell ill this morning.

00:04:45.865 --> 00:04:48.345
I'm weak all over, but I'm holding up.

00:04:48.425 --> 00:04:49.345
Your Ladyship,

00:04:49.425 --> 00:04:51.345
is someone trying to kill us?

00:04:52.585 --> 00:04:54.625
I don't know what poison they used.

00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:57.225
Keep taking the medicine I gave you.

00:04:57.825 --> 00:05:00.345
Starting today,
don't show yourselves again.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.265
Don't touch the food or water.

00:05:02.345 --> 00:05:04.305
Just eat the fruit you saved.

00:05:07.985 --> 00:05:08.985
What about you?

00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:12.465
I have to play along

00:05:13.265 --> 00:05:14.665
and finish the act.

00:05:17.105 --> 00:05:18.265
No one came to visit today.

00:05:18.345 --> 00:05:19.745
Why did Your Ladyship come in person?

00:05:19.825 --> 00:05:22.265
The weather's turning cold.
People get sick.

00:05:22.345 --> 00:05:23.625
So I let them rest.

00:05:24.465 --> 00:05:25.345
Your Ladyship is ill too?

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:26.905
Should we report it?

00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:30.625
If it's not too much trouble,
then please do.

00:05:31.305 --> 00:05:33.065
Forgive me. I'll report it now!

00:05:37.705 --> 00:05:39.865
- Her Ladyship is ill! Report it at once!
- Understood!

00:05:41.785 --> 00:05:43.265
Your Ladyship, it's been reported.

00:05:43.345 --> 00:05:45.905
Starting today,
I'll bring the meals straight in.

00:05:45.985 --> 00:05:46.945
No need.

00:05:47.465 --> 00:05:49.785
Maybe walking around
will help me recover faster.

00:05:58.145 --> 00:06:00.585
Your Ladyship,
this food is poisoned. Don't eat it!

00:06:00.665 --> 00:06:03.105
If you don't eat, how will you get out?

00:06:03.865 --> 00:06:05.905
If you want His Majesty to relent,

00:06:05.985 --> 00:06:07.265
you don't have to really eat it.

00:06:07.345 --> 00:06:08.985
Just put on a show.

00:06:09.065 --> 00:06:10.745
No need to risk your life.

00:06:11.785 --> 00:06:12.625
Don't worry.

00:06:13.385 --> 00:06:15.065
My life still has a purpose.

00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:17.105
I won't let myself die.

00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:19.265
But this time,

00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:20.825
there can be no pretending,

00:06:21.505 --> 00:06:23.265
or it'll all be for nothing.

00:06:25.065 --> 00:06:26.705
Your Ladyship…

00:06:39.705 --> 00:06:41.505
Mutton is most nourishing in autumn.

00:06:42.025 --> 00:06:43.185
Your Majesty doesn't like it?

00:06:43.985 --> 00:06:46.505
This is a northern frontier mutton recipe.

00:06:46.585 --> 00:06:48.105
The Princess Consort of Duan
gave it to you back then.

00:06:49.345 --> 00:06:52.185
Today you specially
asked me here for mutton.

00:06:52.265 --> 00:06:53.825
Do you have something to say?

00:06:55.705 --> 00:06:57.425
Nothing gets past Your Majesty.

00:06:58.025 --> 00:07:00.545
About that child's situation,
Your Majesty must know already.

00:07:02.625 --> 00:07:04.705
She's just playing tricks
and acting pitiful.

00:07:04.785 --> 00:07:07.705
No matter what she does,
it won't surprise me.

00:07:07.785 --> 00:07:10.465
All she wants is to make me soften.

00:07:12.225 --> 00:07:15.065
We thought she'd forgotten
that old matter from 15 years ago.

00:07:15.145 --> 00:07:16.865
But thinking back now,

00:07:16.945 --> 00:07:19.905
that pain she can't speak of
has been tormenting her.

00:07:19.985 --> 00:07:21.145
It's heartbreaking.

00:07:21.865 --> 00:07:22.825
Besides,

00:07:22.905 --> 00:07:24.305
if what she said is true,

00:07:24.385 --> 00:07:25.665
there may be a hidden truth.

00:07:26.265 --> 00:07:27.505
If we can find out the truth

00:07:27.585 --> 00:07:29.145
and the one behind it,

00:07:29.225 --> 00:07:31.305
that would be good for Your Majesty too.

00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:33.545
Good for me?

00:07:34.585 --> 00:07:35.785
The truth?

00:07:38.265 --> 00:07:40.745
A hidden truth in the Prince of Duan case?

00:07:43.385 --> 00:07:44.345
Consort Shu,

00:07:45.745 --> 00:07:47.585
are you implying I failed to see it?

00:07:51.465 --> 00:07:54.625
Your Majesty, I meant no such thing.

00:08:02.545 --> 00:08:03.545
From now on,

00:08:04.425 --> 00:08:06.785
whoever pleads for Li Peiyi again

00:08:07.665 --> 00:08:09.025
can go to keep her company.

00:08:09.105 --> 00:08:10.225
Your Majesty!

00:08:11.585 --> 00:08:12.545
Your Highness…

00:08:13.385 --> 00:08:14.705
His Majesty heard Her Ladyship is ill

00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:17.585
and has sent
Medical Officer Zhao to check on her.

00:08:17.665 --> 00:08:20.905
You should've enjoyed the meal.
Why bring up old matters?

00:08:21.905 --> 00:08:23.825
You're asking for trouble.

00:08:36.945 --> 00:08:38.985
So this is what you've been eating
for the past ten-odd days?

00:08:39.065 --> 00:08:39.904
Yes.

00:08:39.985 --> 00:08:42.305
Her Ladyship said
a silver needle might miss it,

00:08:42.385 --> 00:08:44.305
so she had us save every meal.

00:08:44.385 --> 00:08:46.265
That way, if anything happened,

00:08:46.345 --> 00:08:47.625
we'd have proof to trace.

00:08:48.585 --> 00:08:50.105
You're really bold and careful too.

00:08:50.185 --> 00:08:51.385
You saw it all coming,

00:08:51.985 --> 00:08:53.065
and you even went this far,

00:08:53.145 --> 00:08:54.425
making yourself like this.

00:08:54.505 --> 00:08:56.025
If I still can't catch
the culprit for you,

00:08:56.105 --> 00:08:56.945
I'd be utterly useless.

00:08:58.865 --> 00:09:00.345
Then I'm counting on you.

00:09:01.025 --> 00:09:03.145
No matter how tough I am,
I can't hold on much longer.

00:09:04.265 --> 00:09:05.865
Don't worry. Now I'm here.

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:06.785
You'll have a hard time dying.

00:09:08.345 --> 00:09:09.665
Let me check you two first.

00:09:16.385 --> 00:09:17.385
How long since
you stopped eating the meals?

00:09:17.985 --> 00:09:18.825
Two days.

00:09:18.905 --> 00:09:20.745
But we've kept taking the pills
Her Ladyship gave us.

00:09:20.825 --> 00:09:21.905
What pills?

00:09:22.425 --> 00:09:24.065
Some life-saving pills my master left me.

00:09:24.145 --> 00:09:25.465
They can't cure poison,

00:09:25.545 --> 00:09:26.865
but they protect the heart.

00:09:28.225 --> 00:09:29.505
Same as you,

00:09:29.585 --> 00:09:31.185
they were poisoned with cinnabar.

00:09:31.265 --> 00:09:33.305
But their symptoms
aren't as obvious as yours.

00:09:33.905 --> 00:09:36.145
Yet the poison was in the food.

00:09:36.225 --> 00:09:38.145
Cinnabar isn't colorless or tasteless.

00:09:38.225 --> 00:09:40.025
A silver needle should detect it.

00:09:40.585 --> 00:09:42.185
So why couldn't you find it?

00:09:45.505 --> 00:09:46.705
Medical Officer Zhao,

00:09:46.785 --> 00:09:48.905
you said the food was poisoned!

00:09:52.865 --> 00:09:54.185
We can't taste a thing.

00:09:54.265 --> 00:09:56.785
Whoever did this has a skilled hand.

00:10:17.905 --> 00:10:20.065
Medical Officer Zhao
is just like Her Ladyship,

00:10:20.585 --> 00:10:21.825
so unafraid of death.

00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:24.105
It is cinnabar poisoning.

00:10:27.625 --> 00:10:28.785
I'll go back to the Medical Office.

00:10:28.865 --> 00:10:30.465
Tomorrow I'll bring the antidote.

00:10:31.065 --> 00:10:32.825
It's already harmed your heart.

00:10:32.905 --> 00:10:34.865
If we don't detox it soon, you may die.

00:10:35.465 --> 00:10:36.705
I'll take these back.

00:10:36.785 --> 00:10:38.105
I will uncover the method of poisoning.

00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:39.825
Medical Officer Zhao,

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:41.505
can we report to His Majesty

00:10:41.585 --> 00:10:42.705
that someone poisoned Her Ladyship

00:10:42.785 --> 00:10:43.745
and have him investigate?

00:10:44.865 --> 00:10:45.945
I can report it.

00:10:46.465 --> 00:10:47.985
But if I can't prove
the method of poisoning,

00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:49.385
His Majesty won't believe me.

00:10:50.065 --> 00:10:51.065
How could he not?

00:10:51.145 --> 00:10:53.145
Her Ladyship is already this ill.

00:10:53.225 --> 00:10:54.865
Don't blame anyone else for that.

00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:56.305
I can only blame myself.

00:10:57.385 --> 00:10:59.745
Yudi, I'm counting on you now.

00:11:01.465 --> 00:11:03.865
From now on, the meals they send
really can't be eaten.

00:11:03.945 --> 00:11:05.425
I'll handle your food.

00:11:06.225 --> 00:11:08.305
Give me three days. I will get the answer.

00:11:11.145 --> 00:11:13.145
I'm here by His Majesty's order
to treat Her Ladyship.

00:11:13.225 --> 00:11:14.545
Why won't you let me in?

00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:16.265
We're under orders as well.

00:11:16.345 --> 00:11:17.625
No one is allowed inside.

00:11:20.545 --> 00:11:21.865
Has Medical Officer Zhao returned?

00:11:33.145 --> 00:11:34.945
You let me in last night.

00:11:35.025 --> 00:11:36.185
What's changed?

00:11:36.865 --> 00:11:38.225
Last night we were under orders.

00:11:38.305 --> 00:11:39.705
Today we're under orders too.

00:11:40.625 --> 00:11:42.025
Please don't make it hard on us.

00:11:43.945 --> 00:11:45.185
Then take this medicine in

00:11:45.265 --> 00:11:46.385
and tell the two maids,

00:11:46.465 --> 00:11:47.945
three times a day, one packet each time.

00:11:48.025 --> 00:11:49.825
Simmer on low heat for an hour,

00:11:49.905 --> 00:11:50.745
and take it with ginseng slices.

00:11:50.825 --> 00:11:52.665
Her Ladyship is confined.

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:54.545
Neither people nor medicine can go in.

00:11:54.625 --> 00:11:55.745
She's been poisoned.

00:11:55.825 --> 00:11:56.905
She'll die!

00:11:56.985 --> 00:11:58.425
Who can take responsibility for that?

00:11:58.505 --> 00:12:00.185
But if she takes it and something happens,

00:12:00.265 --> 00:12:02.105
who can take responsibility for that?

00:12:03.625 --> 00:12:05.225
This is absurd!

00:12:06.985 --> 00:12:07.945
Medical Officer Zhao!

00:12:08.465 --> 00:12:10.185
Wuren, you're here at last.

00:12:10.265 --> 00:12:11.185
Her Ladyship is very ill.

00:12:11.265 --> 00:12:13.145
By His Majesty's order,
I'm here to deliver her medicine.

00:12:13.225 --> 00:12:15.145
But they won't let me in,
not even the medicine itself!

00:12:15.745 --> 00:12:17.105
Are you defying the imperial order?

00:12:17.185 --> 00:12:19.185
Letting her in would be defying it.

00:12:19.265 --> 00:12:21.825
If you don't believe us,
go to the palace and ask.

00:12:22.425 --> 00:12:23.705
Her Ladyship is very ill.

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:25.705
By the time we return,
she may already be gone.

00:12:26.305 --> 00:12:27.385
How many lives do you have

00:12:27.465 --> 00:12:28.745
to risk Her Ladyship's life like this?

00:12:30.145 --> 00:12:31.945
Don't you understand?

00:12:32.025 --> 00:12:33.425
Whoever granted
Medical Officer Zhao access yesterday

00:12:33.505 --> 00:12:35.465
is also the one forbidding it today.

00:12:38.265 --> 00:12:39.905
If anything happens to Her Ladyship,

00:12:39.985 --> 00:12:41.585
none of you will live!

00:12:41.665 --> 00:12:42.785
Miss,

00:12:43.305 --> 00:12:44.585
I advise you to go
to the palace for orders.

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:46.465
Don't waste time here.

00:12:48.385 --> 00:12:49.705
I'm begging you, sirs.

00:12:49.785 --> 00:12:51.305
Send the medicine in.

00:12:51.385 --> 00:12:52.585
We'll go ask for orders right now.

00:12:52.665 --> 00:12:54.345
Her Ladyship may have fallen from favor,

00:12:54.425 --> 00:12:55.265
but saving her life

00:12:55.345 --> 00:12:57.025
beats letting her die on your hands.

00:13:01.305 --> 00:13:02.385
Don't kneel to them.

00:13:02.465 --> 00:13:03.745
They're all accomplices.

00:13:13.985 --> 00:13:16.225
It takes so little,
yet it can save a life.

00:13:21.545 --> 00:13:23.945
Just this one packet should
hold her till you go ask for orders.

00:13:24.545 --> 00:13:27.065
If you can't save her,
don't blame us later.

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:32.945
Let's go to the Palace
and beg Consort Shu.

00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:35.625
His Majesty must be furious.

00:13:35.705 --> 00:13:37.545
Without hard evidence,
His Majesty won't believe it.

00:13:37.625 --> 00:13:39.505
I'll go back and find proof now.

00:13:59.185 --> 00:14:00.225
Your Ladyship!

00:14:03.105 --> 00:14:04.105
Your Ladyship.

00:14:05.545 --> 00:14:06.625
Your Ladyship.

00:14:09.905 --> 00:14:10.785
Are you alright?

00:14:13.465 --> 00:14:14.345
Huaijin.

00:14:32.505 --> 00:14:33.785
Sir, you haven't slept all night again?

00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:36.065
It's almost done.

00:14:36.785 --> 00:14:37.625
One more night won't matter.

00:14:39.785 --> 00:14:43.465
{\an8}LIFE-SAVING PILLS: RAW LICORICE ROOT
MUSKMELON PEDICEL, FIGWORT ROOT

00:14:50.545 --> 00:14:52.185
{\an8}A SURE ANTIDOTE TO ARSENIC

00:14:54.825 --> 00:14:56.585
Paper burns easily. Don't come close.

00:14:57.185 --> 00:14:58.225
Take it away!

00:15:04.465 --> 00:15:05.985
Sir, get some rest.

00:15:09.705 --> 00:15:10.905
What day is it now?

00:15:11.505 --> 00:15:12.785
The 23rd.

00:15:14.585 --> 00:15:15.665
It's been 15 days.

00:15:16.825 --> 00:15:18.225
I can't make her wait any longer.

00:15:31.385 --> 00:15:32.945
In the 10th year of Tianbao,

00:15:33.025 --> 00:15:34.425
Chen Village was struck
by a strange Water Plague.

00:15:42.825 --> 00:15:43.665
Where's Xiao Huaijin?

00:15:43.745 --> 00:15:44.785
I asked you, where's Xiao Huaijin?

00:15:44.865 --> 00:15:46.105
At the Records Office.

00:15:52.425 --> 00:15:53.625
Her Ladyship is dying,

00:15:53.705 --> 00:15:55.025
and you're studying stars here?

00:15:55.105 --> 00:15:55.945
What's wrong with Peiyi?

00:15:56.025 --> 00:15:57.225
She's been poisoned.

00:15:57.305 --> 00:15:59.185
His Majesty won't allow anyone to visit.

00:15:59.265 --> 00:16:00.225
She can only wait to die.

00:16:00.825 --> 00:16:02.185
Give me an hour.

00:16:02.705 --> 00:16:04.105
I can save her.

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:08.025
ZICHEN HALL

00:16:10.985 --> 00:16:12.905
Your Highness, you should go back.

00:16:13.505 --> 00:16:14.465
Waiting here

00:16:14.985 --> 00:16:17.265
will only anger His Majesty.

00:16:20.745 --> 00:16:24.625
Last time, Her Ladyship
waited here as well.

00:16:24.705 --> 00:16:26.425
I don't ask His Majesty to forgive Peiyi.

00:16:26.505 --> 00:16:29.505
I only ask to let
Medical Officer Zhao detox her.

00:16:29.585 --> 00:16:31.545
I've already reported it.

00:16:31.625 --> 00:16:34.865
But… His Majesty still hasn't decided.

00:16:35.465 --> 00:16:36.625
Then report it again.

00:16:40.705 --> 00:16:42.025
I'll do my best.

00:16:42.785 --> 00:16:44.825
Your Highness, go back and wait.

00:16:45.625 --> 00:16:46.865
I'll wait outside.

00:17:02.945 --> 00:17:04.265
Got you.

00:17:16.025 --> 00:17:17.704
An hour's up.

00:17:19.025 --> 00:17:20.464
I'm taking these into the palace.

00:17:20.545 --> 00:17:22.665
- Zhu Qing, prepare the carriage.
- Understood.

00:17:32.585 --> 00:17:33.745
Make way!

00:17:33.825 --> 00:17:34.665
HEYUE CONGEE SHOP

00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:42.665
Make way!

00:18:01.665 --> 00:18:03.025
So this is the full star chart?

00:18:03.865 --> 00:18:04.705
Yes.

00:18:05.305 --> 00:18:07.865
Following my grandmaster's instructions,
I've remade the observing lens.

00:18:08.465 --> 00:18:10.345
It can magnify, making the far seem near.

00:18:11.305 --> 00:18:13.865
Everything marked in red
is a newly observed star.

00:18:13.945 --> 00:18:16.745
This chart still needs
some time to complete,

00:18:16.825 --> 00:18:19.745
but at most three years.
It will be far more detailed,

00:18:19.825 --> 00:18:21.585
working with the Dayan Calendar.

00:18:22.425 --> 00:18:25.265
And the calendar
will be more precise and thorough.

00:18:26.465 --> 00:18:28.545
Does it match the Dayan method?

00:18:29.265 --> 00:18:30.225
I've matched them one by one.

00:18:31.105 --> 00:18:31.945
Good.

00:18:32.545 --> 00:18:33.825
Very good!

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:36.665
The foundation of a thriving realm
lies in this.

00:18:36.745 --> 00:18:38.385
At last,

00:18:38.465 --> 00:18:40.265
something has put me at ease.

00:18:40.865 --> 00:18:41.985
Tell me.

00:18:42.065 --> 00:18:43.745
What do you want? I'll reward you.

00:18:50.265 --> 00:18:51.265
Deputy Director,

00:18:51.785 --> 00:18:53.865
His Majesty is most gracious.

00:18:53.945 --> 00:18:55.745
You've earned great merit.

00:18:55.825 --> 00:18:58.425
Name your reward.

00:18:58.505 --> 00:19:01.945
However, His Majesty is always fair
in rewards and punishments.

00:19:02.545 --> 00:19:04.865
With your clear mind,

00:19:04.945 --> 00:19:08.185
you should know reward is reward,
and punishment is punishment.

00:19:08.785 --> 00:19:10.705
Don't mix them up.

00:19:16.945 --> 00:19:18.505
ETERNAL RENEWAL IN IMPERIAL SPLENDOR

00:19:20.145 --> 00:19:21.505
I, Xiao Huaijin,

00:19:21.585 --> 00:19:22.865
ask Your Majesty to grant a marriage.

00:19:23.465 --> 00:19:25.665
I wish to marry
the Princess of Fuchang County,

00:19:25.745 --> 00:19:26.585
Li Peiyi.

00:19:32.265 --> 00:19:33.545
Please grant my request.

00:19:55.145 --> 00:19:56.065
Approved.

00:19:56.145 --> 00:19:58.025
Hurry and give thanks!

00:19:59.905 --> 00:20:01.145
Thank you for Your Majesty's grace!

00:20:01.825 --> 00:20:02.985
Eunuch Guo,

00:20:03.505 --> 00:20:05.745
- handle the marriage decree.
- Understood.

00:20:05.825 --> 00:20:08.145
Deputy Director, you've worked hard.

00:20:08.225 --> 00:20:09.065
Get some rest.

00:20:09.705 --> 00:20:10.545
Understood.

00:20:24.945 --> 00:20:27.865
The Deputy Director is a clever one.

00:20:27.945 --> 00:20:30.945
He really solved Your Majesty's problem.

00:20:31.025 --> 00:20:32.905
What problem do I have?

00:20:34.225 --> 00:20:35.625
Your Majesty has no problems.

00:20:35.705 --> 00:20:38.545
Your Majesty is just soft-hearted.

00:20:39.985 --> 00:20:41.265
So you do understand me.

00:20:41.345 --> 00:20:43.345
I wouldn't dare.

00:20:43.425 --> 00:20:45.185
About the poisoning,

00:20:45.865 --> 00:20:46.705
in the end,

00:20:47.305 --> 00:20:49.025
is she just faking it,

00:20:49.105 --> 00:20:50.345
or is it the real thing?

00:20:51.065 --> 00:20:53.625
Medical Officer Zhao Yudi just reported.

00:20:53.705 --> 00:20:56.785
This poison was laid very cleverly.

00:20:57.385 --> 00:21:00.665
They likely used water laced with cinnabar
to cook the meals.

00:21:01.185 --> 00:21:04.225
But in each dish,
the cinnabar was only a trace.

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:07.905
Even a silver needle test
couldn't detect it.

00:21:08.505 --> 00:21:09.665
But little by little,

00:21:09.745 --> 00:21:11.385
it will strike before long.

00:21:11.985 --> 00:21:12.985
And what's more,

00:21:13.065 --> 00:21:14.705
there's no proof of poisoning.

00:21:15.385 --> 00:21:17.225
Then how did she find it?

00:21:18.025 --> 00:21:20.105
Zhao Yudi checked old texts

00:21:20.705 --> 00:21:23.345
and found a case
where cinnabar got into a well,

00:21:23.425 --> 00:21:25.985
poisoning an entire village.

00:21:26.065 --> 00:21:28.025
That inspired her.

00:21:28.105 --> 00:21:29.425
So,

00:21:29.505 --> 00:21:33.465
she boiled down all Her Ladyship's meals.

00:21:33.545 --> 00:21:34.985
After the liquid was cooked off,

00:21:35.065 --> 00:21:36.665
she tested it with a silver needle,

00:21:36.745 --> 00:21:38.305
and the poison showed.

00:21:39.585 --> 00:21:41.945
So who wants Peiyi dead?

00:21:42.545 --> 00:21:43.505
Well… (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:21:44.945 --> 00:21:46.985
I truly don't know.

00:21:48.465 --> 00:21:51.745
Could it really be tied
to the Prince of Duan's case?

00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:54.865
Your Majesty is suspecting…

00:21:55.745 --> 00:21:58.545
Back then, the Prince of Duan
submitted his memorial and command tally.

00:21:58.625 --> 00:22:00.265
If you hadn't found them,

00:22:00.905 --> 00:22:03.545
they could have been lost
under my desk for ages.

00:22:09.705 --> 00:22:11.505
What is it? Say it.

00:22:15.425 --> 00:22:18.665
The Prince of Duan's memorial
back then was heartfelt.

00:22:19.345 --> 00:22:22.225
He simply didn't want to keep
fighting outside.

00:22:22.305 --> 00:22:25.305
All he wanted was to hand back command

00:22:25.385 --> 00:22:27.745
and stay in Western Capital
with his wife and child.

00:22:28.425 --> 00:22:30.225
That's why Your Majesty

00:22:30.745 --> 00:22:32.465
had this servant send a young eunuch

00:22:32.545 --> 00:22:33.985
to the Prince of Duan's manor
with the message.

00:22:34.585 --> 00:22:36.305
Not to haul the Prince of Duan in,

00:22:36.385 --> 00:22:37.985
but to invite him.

00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:40.905
But that young eunuch arrived too late.

00:22:40.985 --> 00:22:43.145
That eunuch died
in the Prince of Duan's manor too, right?

00:22:44.185 --> 00:22:47.345
Back then, I only thought
he met with sudden misfortune.

00:22:47.945 --> 00:22:49.345
But thinking back now,

00:22:49.425 --> 00:22:51.145
with so many Imperial Guards there,

00:22:51.225 --> 00:22:52.865
they could have protected

00:22:53.465 --> 00:22:55.545
a eunuch delivering Your Majesty's decree.

00:22:57.265 --> 00:22:58.825
What are you getting at?

00:22:58.905 --> 00:23:03.105
If what Her Ladyship suspects is true,

00:23:04.265 --> 00:23:05.705
then that young eunuch…

00:23:08.425 --> 00:23:09.745
wasn't killed by the Prince of Duan.

00:23:12.225 --> 00:23:13.345
Fine…

00:23:13.425 --> 00:23:14.865
Fine…

00:23:15.785 --> 00:23:17.945
Ghost Festival was ages ago,

00:23:18.465 --> 00:23:20.105
and there are still ghosts
hopping around out there.

00:23:20.905 --> 00:23:23.025
I'll send men to investigate at once!

00:23:23.105 --> 00:23:23.945
Enough.

00:23:24.985 --> 00:23:26.785
That child has plotted for years,

00:23:26.865 --> 00:23:28.625
even betting her own life on it.

00:23:29.225 --> 00:23:30.665
Let her investigate it herself.

00:24:30.025 --> 00:24:31.065
How is Her Ladyship?

00:24:38.945 --> 00:24:40.985
Won't you go in and see her?

00:24:44.585 --> 00:24:46.625
So many eyes are fixed on this place.

00:24:47.265 --> 00:24:48.345
Until she wakes,

00:24:48.425 --> 00:24:49.625
I don't want to stir up trouble.

00:24:50.145 --> 00:24:51.345
I'll come again tomorrow.

00:24:55.705 --> 00:24:59.425
PRINCE OF DUAN'S MANOR

00:25:10.025 --> 00:25:11.065
Boss.

00:25:12.545 --> 00:25:14.825
Deputy Director tried hard to save you.

00:25:15.345 --> 00:25:17.425
He made a scope

00:25:17.505 --> 00:25:19.985
and recopied several boxes of books.

00:25:20.585 --> 00:25:22.105
His Majesty was over the moon,

00:25:22.625 --> 00:25:24.345
so he finally agreed to see him.

00:25:25.145 --> 00:25:27.665
Consort Shu and Medical Officer Zhao

00:25:27.745 --> 00:25:29.225
have worried themselves sick over you.

00:25:29.825 --> 00:25:32.025
Can you stop risking your life like this?

00:25:32.545 --> 00:25:34.505
So many people are worried about you.

00:25:36.665 --> 00:25:37.585
Boss,

00:25:38.705 --> 00:25:39.665
guess what

00:25:39.745 --> 00:25:42.585
Mr. Xiao asked His Majesty
to reward him with?

00:25:43.385 --> 00:25:45.145
I'll tell you in secret.

00:25:46.385 --> 00:25:47.585
But pretend you don't know later.

00:25:50.625 --> 00:25:52.145
Mr. Xiao

00:25:52.225 --> 00:25:53.865
asked His Majesty

00:25:54.865 --> 00:25:56.425
to grant a marriage for you two.

00:26:01.665 --> 00:26:02.945
What did you say?

00:26:07.385 --> 00:26:08.225
Boss.

00:26:09.385 --> 00:26:10.265
You're awake?

00:26:13.385 --> 00:26:15.305
Boss, you're finally awake!

00:26:16.745 --> 00:26:18.625
- Let go.
- I won't!

00:26:20.185 --> 00:26:21.025
Let go!

00:26:21.105 --> 00:26:22.225
No!

00:26:23.145 --> 00:26:24.505
You're choking me to death!

00:26:29.505 --> 00:26:30.865
You scared me to death!

00:26:31.465 --> 00:26:32.505
Stop crying.

00:26:33.105 --> 00:26:34.185
I told you

00:26:34.705 --> 00:26:36.585
I'm hard to kill. I won't die.

00:26:37.265 --> 00:26:38.825
You're just lucky.

00:26:38.905 --> 00:26:41.025
So many people
are risking their lives for you.

00:26:43.185 --> 00:26:44.145
Yeah.

00:26:45.025 --> 00:26:46.145
I guess I am pretty lucky.

00:26:46.985 --> 00:26:47.905
That's right.

00:26:48.585 --> 00:26:51.105
I'll tell Xibai and Yuebai to send word.

00:26:51.185 --> 00:26:53.025
We'll let Consort Shu,
Medical Officer Zhao,

00:26:53.105 --> 00:26:55.225
and Deputy Director Xiao celebrate!

00:27:00.625 --> 00:27:01.665
Boss,

00:27:02.225 --> 00:27:04.145
you were one foot in the grave,

00:27:04.225 --> 00:27:06.225
yet you still wouldn't let this go.

00:27:08.345 --> 00:27:11.585
You never treasured
my gifts to you like this.

00:27:12.585 --> 00:27:15.345
This is something
Huaijin has carried for over ten years.

00:27:15.865 --> 00:27:17.265
And what did you give me?

00:27:17.345 --> 00:27:18.305
Buns and pancakes.

00:27:18.945 --> 00:27:20.145
Boss,

00:27:20.225 --> 00:27:23.305
are you losing it?

00:27:23.825 --> 00:27:24.985
What did you just call him?

00:27:30.665 --> 00:27:31.425
Right.

00:27:32.025 --> 00:27:33.345
What I said was,

00:27:33.425 --> 00:27:35.585
Mr. Xiao asked His Majesty

00:27:35.665 --> 00:27:37.145
to grant a marriage for you two.

00:27:57.345 --> 00:27:59.065
Li Peiyi actually woke up!

00:27:59.625 --> 00:28:00.785
She was this close.

00:28:01.465 --> 00:28:02.825
I didn't expect her to be so hard to kill.

00:28:02.905 --> 00:28:05.545
A single more day's delay,
and she would've died for sure.

00:28:05.625 --> 00:28:07.865
What's the point of saying all this now?

00:28:08.545 --> 00:28:10.625
I laid the poison very carefully.

00:28:10.705 --> 00:28:13.345
Even if they know she was poisoned,
they won't trace it to me.

00:28:14.705 --> 00:28:18.225
She doesn't know that 15 years ago,
I was the one who led troops to her home.

00:28:18.305 --> 00:28:19.665
But His Majesty knows!

00:28:21.505 --> 00:28:24.305
If she died without a sound this time,

00:28:24.385 --> 00:28:26.305
I'd still have room to maneuver.

00:28:26.385 --> 00:28:29.945
But now that she crawled back from death,

00:28:30.025 --> 00:28:31.305
what will His Majesty think?

00:28:32.665 --> 00:28:34.865
So what if they can't trace it to you?

00:28:34.945 --> 00:28:36.025
His Majesty already knows

00:28:36.105 --> 00:28:37.505
I made a move on her!

00:28:39.985 --> 00:28:41.585
I… I'll do it again…

00:28:42.625 --> 00:28:44.865
This time, I definitely…
can… can get rid of her.

00:28:45.465 --> 00:28:46.385
You useless fool!

00:28:48.625 --> 00:28:49.825
Have you found Lv Chongshan?

00:28:49.905 --> 00:28:50.745
Not yet.

00:28:51.425 --> 00:28:54.025
Find him. Then I'll spare your life.

00:28:54.105 --> 00:28:55.625
Otherwise,

00:28:56.145 --> 00:28:58.305
I'll send you to meet Du Zhixing!

00:28:58.865 --> 00:29:00.065
- Get out!
- Understood!

00:29:00.145 --> 00:29:01.665
I'll bring Lv Chongshan back!

00:29:08.345 --> 00:29:11.145
XIAO'S MANSION

00:29:11.745 --> 00:29:13.225
- Put it there.
- Understood.

00:29:15.905 --> 00:29:17.785
His Majesty hasn't issued the decree yet.

00:29:17.865 --> 00:29:19.865
Why rush to prepare all this?

00:29:22.585 --> 00:29:24.305
Once His Majesty decrees it,

00:29:24.385 --> 00:29:26.265
we'll have to plan the wedding.

00:29:26.345 --> 00:29:28.745
By then, we won't have time to scramble.

00:29:28.825 --> 00:29:31.065
What if His Majesty
won't issue the decree?

00:29:31.625 --> 00:29:34.025
Then our family
would become a laughingstock.

00:29:34.865 --> 00:29:36.545
I've asked around.

00:29:36.625 --> 00:29:40.105
Consort Shu
is already preparing her dowry.

00:29:41.145 --> 00:29:44.865
As for the marriage decree,
Eunuch Guo is handling it himself.

00:29:44.945 --> 00:29:46.065
It won't be wrong.

00:29:47.425 --> 00:29:49.385
Being impatient does no good.

00:29:49.985 --> 00:29:51.425
It's not that I'm impatient.

00:29:51.945 --> 00:29:53.625
I'm afraid we'll slight Her Ladyship.

00:29:54.225 --> 00:29:55.425
That child has had it hard.

00:29:55.505 --> 00:29:57.665
I won't just be her in-laws.

00:29:58.465 --> 00:30:00.185
I must think of her natal family too.

00:30:01.265 --> 00:30:03.905
She has Consort Shu as her backing.

00:30:04.425 --> 00:30:05.705
Why worry so much?

00:30:05.785 --> 00:30:07.425
Consort Shu may be noble,

00:30:07.945 --> 00:30:10.385
but she has never raised a child herself.

00:30:10.465 --> 00:30:12.145
When she plans things,

00:30:12.665 --> 00:30:14.465
she may not think of everything.

00:30:15.225 --> 00:30:17.145
You're getting more and more improper.

00:30:17.945 --> 00:30:19.225
Fine.

00:30:19.305 --> 00:30:20.145
Do as you wish.

00:30:24.065 --> 00:30:25.825
Father. Mother.

00:30:26.985 --> 00:30:28.105
I didn't discuss it with you first

00:30:28.185 --> 00:30:29.745
and asked His Majesty
for the marriage on my own.

00:30:29.825 --> 00:30:31.105
That was my fault.

00:30:31.185 --> 00:30:32.225
But it was urgent.

00:30:33.825 --> 00:30:35.145
Please forgive me.

00:30:39.385 --> 00:30:40.585
Silly child,

00:30:40.665 --> 00:30:42.585
what nonsense are you saying?

00:30:44.025 --> 00:30:46.145
We're happy beyond words.

00:30:51.105 --> 00:30:51.945
Father, rest assured.

00:30:52.025 --> 00:30:53.505
Even if I marry Her Ladyship,

00:30:53.585 --> 00:30:55.585
I'll still stay at the Astronomical Bureau

00:30:55.665 --> 00:30:57.025
and keep out of court affairs.

00:30:57.105 --> 00:30:58.585
It's a joyful matter.

00:30:58.665 --> 00:30:59.945
Why bring that up?

00:31:00.545 --> 00:31:03.345
You went to such lengths to marry her.

00:31:03.425 --> 00:31:05.385
You must treat her well.

00:31:07.825 --> 00:31:08.745
Got it.

00:31:09.585 --> 00:31:11.305
Always like this,

00:31:11.385 --> 00:31:13.505
he just can't speak nicely.

00:31:14.705 --> 00:31:15.545
Sit.

00:31:19.545 --> 00:31:21.065
Have you gone to see Peiyi?

00:31:23.585 --> 00:31:26.665
She woke up the other day.

00:31:26.745 --> 00:31:27.945
Why haven't you gone?

00:31:28.865 --> 00:31:30.105
I asked to marry her

00:31:30.625 --> 00:31:32.185
without her consent.

00:31:32.265 --> 00:31:33.825
I don't know if she'll mind.

00:31:33.905 --> 00:31:35.785
And His Majesty hasn't decreed it yet,

00:31:35.865 --> 00:31:37.465
but the news is already out.

00:31:37.545 --> 00:31:39.425
If I show up rashly,
it could hurt her reputation.

00:31:39.505 --> 00:31:41.345
If you can't go in person,

00:31:42.745 --> 00:31:44.385
you can at least send word.

00:31:45.945 --> 00:31:47.465
You asked to marry her,

00:31:47.545 --> 00:31:49.425
yet you won't even show up.

00:31:49.505 --> 00:31:50.745
What will she think?

00:31:51.705 --> 00:31:53.145
I'm waiting for the right chance.

00:31:53.225 --> 00:31:55.665
Chances are made,

00:31:55.745 --> 00:31:56.905
not waited for.

00:31:57.985 --> 00:31:58.905
Mother,

00:31:59.545 --> 00:32:00.745
I came back today

00:32:00.825 --> 00:32:02.585
to ask you to go with me to call on her.

00:32:03.185 --> 00:32:04.425
That way, it's proper,

00:32:04.505 --> 00:32:06.265
and people won't gossip about her.

00:32:06.865 --> 00:32:07.825
If I go,

00:32:08.345 --> 00:32:09.825
that's a formal proposal.

00:32:09.905 --> 00:32:11.265
Before you propose,

00:32:11.345 --> 00:32:14.505
you must tell her exactly how you feel.

00:32:15.105 --> 00:32:17.465
Did you ask to marry her
because you like her

00:32:17.545 --> 00:32:19.425
and value her deeply?

00:32:19.505 --> 00:32:21.665
Or was it merely a desperate measure

00:32:21.745 --> 00:32:24.745
taken in the moment to save her?

00:32:25.585 --> 00:32:26.625
Of course…

00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:29.265
I truly like her.

00:32:29.985 --> 00:32:31.785
I'm sure she understands.

00:32:31.865 --> 00:32:34.025
Whether she understands or not,

00:32:34.545 --> 00:32:36.345
you must say it clearly.

00:32:36.425 --> 00:32:40.385
For a woman, that matters.

00:32:46.265 --> 00:32:47.585
You're right.

00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:48.945
I didn't think it through enough.

00:32:51.585 --> 00:32:52.945
Silly child.

00:33:03.105 --> 00:33:05.985
GRACEFUL VIRTUE, TIMELY RAINS

00:33:08.945 --> 00:33:10.145
It's been three days.

00:33:11.585 --> 00:33:13.665
He doesn't know I'm awake?

00:33:39.225 --> 00:33:41.305
This rabbit lantern is for you.

00:33:57.465 --> 00:33:58.345
Peiyi…

00:34:01.145 --> 00:34:02.065
I'm sorry.

00:34:02.825 --> 00:34:04.425
I shouldn't have waited
till today to see you.

00:34:05.785 --> 00:34:06.905
I thought it over and over

00:34:07.985 --> 00:34:09.705
and didn't know how to explain it to you

00:34:10.465 --> 00:34:12.505
or how to do it
without hurting your reputation.

00:34:13.025 --> 00:34:15.185
But I ignored how you felt.

00:34:16.385 --> 00:34:18.185
I forgot that even being one moment late

00:34:19.344 --> 00:34:20.705
would still hurt you.

00:34:24.945 --> 00:34:26.425
You're overthinking it.

00:34:28.225 --> 00:34:29.865
I asked His Majesty to grant the marriage

00:34:30.425 --> 00:34:31.865
to save you,

00:34:32.505 --> 00:34:33.585
but not just to save you.

00:34:35.585 --> 00:34:37.784
Are you playing word games with me?

00:34:40.225 --> 00:34:42.625
Peiyi, believe me.

00:34:43.385 --> 00:34:45.744
This is the moment I least wanted
to ask His Majesty to let me marry you.

00:34:46.344 --> 00:34:49.025
I wanted to tell you how I feel

00:34:49.545 --> 00:34:51.264
with no trouble in the way.

00:34:55.665 --> 00:34:56.865
If fortune favors me

00:34:57.505 --> 00:34:59.185
and you would take me as your own,

00:34:59.265 --> 00:35:01.385
then I'd ask His Majesty
for the marriage decree.

00:35:02.185 --> 00:35:03.865
If His Majesty thinks I'm unworthy,

00:35:04.385 --> 00:35:06.545
I'll do all I can to become worthy of you.

00:35:07.185 --> 00:35:08.385
If His Majesty still refuses,

00:35:08.985 --> 00:35:11.785
I'd risk my life to prove my heart.

00:35:16.385 --> 00:35:17.465
This is something

00:35:17.985 --> 00:35:19.865
I should have first
asked your consent for.

00:35:20.465 --> 00:35:22.145
But I was too anxious.

00:35:22.225 --> 00:35:23.745
I was afraid that harm might befall you.

00:35:25.825 --> 00:35:27.345
I was afraid that one moment's delay…

00:35:30.305 --> 00:35:31.585
would mean losing you.

00:35:32.745 --> 00:35:34.265
So I came up with this foolish plan,

00:35:34.785 --> 00:35:36.425
thinking I was being clever.

00:35:38.385 --> 00:35:39.585
But after that,

00:35:40.825 --> 00:35:42.425
I started worrying again.

00:35:42.505 --> 00:35:44.665
You always have your own plans.

00:35:45.385 --> 00:35:46.665
I don't know

00:35:46.745 --> 00:35:48.345
if this messed up what you meant to do

00:35:48.425 --> 00:35:49.905
or if it made you feel

00:35:50.865 --> 00:35:51.985
like I'm full of myself.

00:35:53.865 --> 00:35:55.065
My head is a mess.

00:35:55.145 --> 00:35:56.825
The more I think, the less I understand.

00:36:07.865 --> 00:36:11.265
I never knew you could talk this much.

00:36:12.065 --> 00:36:14.025
My head is spinning from it.

00:36:14.825 --> 00:36:16.305
But did you just say

00:36:17.265 --> 00:36:18.585
you like me

00:36:19.225 --> 00:36:20.225
and want to marry me?

00:36:28.705 --> 00:36:29.825
Peiyi…

00:36:33.225 --> 00:36:34.385
I like you.

00:36:35.865 --> 00:36:36.825
I want to marry you.

00:36:41.025 --> 00:36:42.425
Will you say yes?

00:37:25.825 --> 00:37:29.865
ZICHEN HALL

00:37:31.825 --> 00:37:33.585
Heed His Majesty's decree!

00:37:38.705 --> 00:37:40.945
Peiyi, Princess of Fuchang County,

00:37:41.025 --> 00:37:43.505
comely in demeanor, pure in heart,

00:37:43.585 --> 00:37:46.465
virtuous within and fair without,

00:37:46.545 --> 00:37:50.305
is hereby granted
the title Princess Yong'an.

00:37:50.825 --> 00:37:53.985
Now that Her Highness
has reached a marriageable age

00:37:54.065 --> 00:37:57.305
and Xiao Huaijin, Deputy Director
of the Astronomical Bureau,

00:37:57.385 --> 00:38:00.105
a man of wide learning
and complete virtue,

00:38:00.185 --> 00:38:04.065
has long admired Princess Yong'an
and seeks her hand,

00:38:04.145 --> 00:38:05.945
we are deeply pleased.

00:38:06.025 --> 00:38:07.825
We bestow upon them 100 mu of fertile land

00:38:07.905 --> 00:38:09.265
and 1,000 bolts of fine silk.

00:38:10.145 --> 00:38:12.305
We hereby marry off Princess Yong'an

00:38:12.385 --> 00:38:14.505
to Xiao Huaijin.

00:38:14.585 --> 00:38:17.345
The Ministry of Rites and Consort Shu

00:38:17.425 --> 00:38:18.945
shall confer and arrange the wedding date.

00:38:19.025 --> 00:38:20.985
Let this decree be executed.

00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:22.305
Accept the decree!

00:38:22.905 --> 00:38:24.345
Thank you, Your Majesty!

00:38:38.905 --> 00:38:40.465
Eunuch Guo, please lead the way.

00:38:40.545 --> 00:38:41.865
We must see His Majesty
and give thanks in person.

00:38:43.225 --> 00:38:45.825
His Majesty understands
Your Highness has only just recovered.

00:38:45.905 --> 00:38:47.985
He has spared you these formalities,

00:38:48.065 --> 00:38:50.425
so that you may return, rest,

00:38:50.505 --> 00:38:52.265
and prepare for the wedding.

00:38:53.225 --> 00:38:55.785
Does His Majesty know
what happened to me while I was confined?

00:38:56.385 --> 00:38:57.745
Of course he knows.

00:38:58.505 --> 00:38:59.825
His Majesty was furious

00:38:59.905 --> 00:39:03.225
and ordered the Court of Judicial Review
to investigate.

00:39:05.225 --> 00:39:06.985
Ordered them to investigate?

00:39:07.065 --> 00:39:08.545
What is there left to investigate?

00:39:09.945 --> 00:39:13.145
I nearly forgot
to congratulate Your Highness.

00:39:13.225 --> 00:39:16.065
His Majesty also granted extra favor.

00:39:16.145 --> 00:39:17.385
The Prince of Duan's Manor

00:39:17.465 --> 00:39:19.345
will be renamed Princess Yong'an's Mansion

00:39:19.945 --> 00:39:21.825
and bestowed on you as your home.

00:39:21.905 --> 00:39:22.785
From now on,

00:39:22.865 --> 00:39:24.865
Your Highness can go home again.

00:39:29.785 --> 00:39:31.625
Since Your Majesty won't see me,

00:39:32.425 --> 00:39:33.585
I will take my leave.

00:39:36.265 --> 00:39:38.825
I only ask Your Majesty to take pity on me

00:39:39.425 --> 00:39:41.185
and allow me to host a banquet

00:39:41.265 --> 00:39:42.545
at my residence to entertain guests

00:39:42.625 --> 00:39:43.705
and give thanks for Your grace!

00:39:55.585 --> 00:39:58.065
His Majesty's oral decree.
Her Highness's request is granted.

00:40:01.945 --> 00:40:03.665
Princess Yong'an,

00:40:03.745 --> 00:40:06.505
you're truly cherished by His Majesty.

00:40:06.585 --> 00:40:07.985
His Majesty has approved it.

00:40:08.065 --> 00:40:10.025
Hurry and give thanks.

00:40:11.745 --> 00:40:12.665
Peiyi

00:40:13.185 --> 00:40:15.185
thanks Your Majesty for boundless grace!

00:40:24.585 --> 00:40:25.865
Thank you, Eunuch Guo.

00:40:34.625 --> 00:40:35.945
Peiyi.

00:40:37.985 --> 00:40:39.745
You've endured this far.

00:40:40.865 --> 00:40:42.025
Don't let it all be for nothing.

00:40:42.105 --> 00:40:44.945
He clearly knows who poisoned me.

00:40:45.025 --> 00:40:47.225
He clearly knows
who killed my whole family.

00:40:47.305 --> 00:40:48.225
Why won't he say it?

00:40:49.345 --> 00:40:51.225
But he didn't stop you
from digging deeper.

00:40:53.425 --> 00:40:54.345
Some things,

00:40:55.465 --> 00:40:58.425
His Majesty can't say himself
or do himself.

00:40:59.145 --> 00:41:00.145
His silent consent

00:41:00.665 --> 00:41:02.225
already shows his stance.

00:41:02.305 --> 00:41:03.585
I don't want a stance.

00:41:05.065 --> 00:41:06.665
I want an answer.

00:41:07.185 --> 00:41:10.105
One answer he could give
with a single word!

00:41:14.505 --> 00:41:15.825
Since he won't say it,

00:41:16.345 --> 00:41:17.665
we'll find it ourselves.

00:41:18.585 --> 00:41:20.345
I've already staked my life

00:41:21.385 --> 00:41:23.105
to prove that 15 years ago,

00:41:23.185 --> 00:41:24.425
the man sent with the message

00:41:24.505 --> 00:41:26.305
was the one who killed my whole family.

00:41:28.265 --> 00:41:29.985
He knows it in his gut,

00:41:30.505 --> 00:41:31.905
yet he won't lift a finger.

00:41:32.825 --> 00:41:34.065
What else can I do?

00:41:36.865 --> 00:41:38.745
Someone really did try to kill you.

00:41:39.425 --> 00:41:41.865
But their tie to the massacre 15 years ago

00:41:42.585 --> 00:41:44.065
needs evidence.

00:42:02.985 --> 00:42:04.345
You have me now.

00:42:05.705 --> 00:42:07.345
I'm willing to risk my life

00:42:08.145 --> 00:42:09.585
to help you find the killer.

00:42:24.025 --> 00:42:26.025
Maybe I just haven't tried hard enough

00:42:27.465 --> 00:42:29.505
to make that person pay.

00:42:32.865 --> 00:42:34.785
Then I'll try harder.

00:42:42.545 --> 00:42:44.105
I'll try harder too.
