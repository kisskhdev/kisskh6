WEBVTT

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:26.470
Via, I didn’t want to do it.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.484
Let’s talk.

00:00:28.115 --> 00:00:29.796
Just not here.
There are too many people.

00:00:30.724 --> 00:00:31.851
It’s Larkin Sanchez!

00:00:31.851 --> 00:00:32.685
Hey! It really is Larkin!

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:34.085
- Come on!
- Larkin! Take a photo with us!

00:00:34.228 --> 00:00:35.396
That Arkin is such an asshole,

00:00:35.396 --> 00:00:37.093
having the nerve
to cheat on Clea.

00:00:37.481 --> 00:00:40.401
Seriously, Larkin Sanchez?
You’re disgusting.

00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:42.115
Whoever that girl is in the picture,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.697
I hope you know the guy you’re
hugging already has a girlfriend!

00:00:44.758 --> 00:00:45.789
Via!

00:00:46.574 --> 00:00:47.491
I’m sorry.

00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:48.492
Let him be. Come on.

00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:50.411
I hope karma hits you both!

00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:52.204
Isn’t she the one Larkin was
hugging over in España?

00:00:52.204 --> 00:00:53.873
Who the fuck is that girl?

00:00:53.873 --> 00:00:55.314
I thought she was just a fan!

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.009
I feel like he just used Clea so
he could become famous.

00:00:59.253 --> 00:01:01.130
Yanna, how do I look?

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.631
You’re beautiful, Via.

00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:04.175
And you have a good heart.

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:06.507
You’re still my baby, Via.

00:01:09.722 --> 00:01:11.390
Are you going to
end things with him?

00:01:12.175 --> 00:01:13.203
Clea!

00:01:14.185 --> 00:01:16.687
OMG! I saw Clea
and Arkin’s side-chick

00:01:16.687 --> 00:01:18.522
in our subdivision yesterday.

00:01:18.522 --> 00:01:20.441
She was picking a fight with Clea.

00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:21.478
Hey, bitch!

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.526
You slut!

00:01:22.526 --> 00:01:23.319
You’re going too far.

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:24.069
That’s enough—

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:25.070
Via!

00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:32.460
Yes, Mommy Jo? Yeah.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.257
I’ll see what I can do, okay?

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.499
Hi.

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:38.792
- Larkin?
- Yes, sir.

00:01:38.792 --> 00:01:41.003
Okay. Allie’s son?

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:41.754
Yes, sir.

00:01:41.754 --> 00:01:43.297
Matt Villanueva from
Cloud Entertainment.

00:01:43.297 --> 00:01:44.340
Nice meeting you, sir.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.467
All right. Okay.

00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:49.595
So this is your dream, huh?

00:01:50.156 --> 00:01:51.597
Because if it’s not, just tell me.

00:01:51.597 --> 00:01:53.182
I don’t like wasting time.

00:01:54.096 --> 00:01:55.097
Yes, sir.

00:01:55.577 --> 00:01:56.578
Good, good.

00:01:57.407 --> 00:01:58.575
So tell me,

00:01:59.288 --> 00:02:00.751
how badly do you want this?

00:02:00.776 --> 00:02:04.613
A lot of people are scrambling
for the position you’re in.

00:02:06.862 --> 00:02:08.113
I really want this, sir.

00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:13.556
I want to write songs and
act in movies and TV series.

00:02:13.744 --> 00:02:14.578
Okay…

00:02:14.578 --> 00:02:15.996
And most of all,
I want to be a director.

00:02:15.996 --> 00:02:17.498
That’s my end goal, sir.

00:02:17.498 --> 00:02:19.667
Wow.

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:20.834
A dreamer.

00:02:21.043 --> 00:02:22.378
- I like that!
- Yes, sir.

00:02:23.837 --> 00:02:25.923
But big dreams
come at a big cost.

00:02:26.966 --> 00:02:28.550
But don’t worry, I’m here.

00:02:29.093 --> 00:02:31.929
Trust me. Follow my lead. I’ve got you.

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:34.265
We’ll make all your
dreams come true.

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:35.474
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

00:02:36.308 --> 00:02:37.559
But let me warn you,

00:02:38.727 --> 00:02:40.145
this won’t be easy.

00:02:45.693 --> 00:02:47.152
Hey, relax!

00:02:47.152 --> 00:02:48.487
We can do this.

00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:50.990
That’s good. I like it.

00:03:02.584 --> 00:03:03.877
You need to act like a couple.

00:03:03.877 --> 00:03:05.254
A real couple.

00:03:05.254 --> 00:03:06.714
That’s what people want.

00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:10.050
Sir, isn’t that kind
of deceiving the fans?

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.260
- If we do that?
- No, no.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.680
That’s called
fan service, Larkin. Okay?

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.890
Give them what they want,
but not too much.

00:03:17.558 --> 00:03:20.352
You just need to be
sweet together.

00:03:20.352 --> 00:03:21.478
Keep them wanting more,

00:03:21.478 --> 00:03:22.855
especially about
your relationship status.

00:03:22.855 --> 00:03:24.148
That’s what we’re going to do.

00:03:24.565 --> 00:03:25.587
Yes!

00:03:27.985 --> 00:03:29.016
Why?

00:03:29.653 --> 00:03:31.488
Is there a problem? Can’t you do it?

00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:34.366
I thought this was your dream.

00:03:34.783 --> 00:03:36.035
This is what you want, right?

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.330
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:03:39.613 --> 00:03:40.489
No, sir.

00:03:40.812 --> 00:03:41.813
I can do it.

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:43.542
Good, good.

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:44.793
Good dreamer.

00:03:44.793 --> 00:03:46.587
Good dreamer, let’s go!

00:05:09.002 --> 00:05:10.170
- That’s enough—
- Slut!

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.923
- Washed up.
- You’re a one-hit wonder.

00:05:12.923 --> 00:05:14.071
You’re washed up, outdated!

00:05:14.758 --> 00:05:16.260
- That’s enough—
- Slut!

00:05:17.845 --> 00:05:18.762
That suits you!

00:05:18.762 --> 00:05:20.013
- You and Arkin don’t belong together.
- You deserve it!

00:05:20.013 --> 00:05:20.722
Hey!

00:05:20.722 --> 00:05:21.432
You’re going too far.

00:05:21.432 --> 00:05:22.533
What is this?

00:05:22.558 --> 00:05:23.267
Please stop.

00:05:23.267 --> 00:05:24.268
What’s your problem?

00:05:24.268 --> 00:05:25.269
Are you all crazy?

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:27.062
- Your daughter’s a side-chick!
- Go home already!

00:05:27.062 --> 00:05:28.856
- She’s a slut!
- It’s true.

00:05:28.952 --> 00:05:30.313
Get out of here!

00:05:30.607 --> 00:05:32.192
- She’s a slut.
- Go!

00:05:32.192 --> 00:05:33.861
She’s stealing Arkin—

00:05:33.861 --> 00:05:35.112
- Want me to fight back?
- She’s such a whore!

00:05:35.112 --> 00:05:36.280
- You better remember this day.
- Go home!

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.990
Wait for us.
We’ll come back for you.

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:39.950
Remember this!

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.048
You’re all insane!

00:05:41.243 --> 00:05:42.661
- Go away!
- We’ll come back for you!

00:05:42.661 --> 00:05:44.371
- Go away!
- We’ll come back for you!

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:45.828
So shameless!

00:05:50.634 --> 00:05:52.053
Via… Sweetheart?

00:05:53.585 --> 00:05:55.003
What if next time,

00:05:55.028 --> 00:05:57.155
they deliberately drag
my family into this?

00:05:59.678 --> 00:06:01.680
Sorry. I’m sorry.

00:06:11.732 --> 00:06:12.941
This is all my fault.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.776
Papa, this is my fault. I’m sorry.

00:06:14.776 --> 00:06:16.487
This is my fault. I’m so sorry.

00:06:16.487 --> 00:06:18.155
It’s all my fault. I’m sorry.
I’m so sorry.

00:06:18.155 --> 00:06:20.282
Papa, I’m sorry.

00:06:20.282 --> 00:06:21.283
Sorry.

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:45.169
Mira? Ysha?

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.118
I’m sorry about what happened.

00:06:56.228 --> 00:06:57.730
You shouldn’t have
been involved in this.

00:06:57.755 --> 00:06:59.632
You shouldn’t have been
dragged into this mess.

00:07:00.489 --> 00:07:02.391
It’s not your fault, Via.

00:07:03.242 --> 00:07:05.369
We’re always here for you, Via.

00:07:07.207 --> 00:07:08.375
Thank you.

00:07:12.209 --> 00:07:13.835
I’m really sorry.

00:07:15.003 --> 00:07:17.548
Thank you. I’m sorry.

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:21.927
All right now.

00:07:22.428 --> 00:07:23.595
Are you sure you’re both okay?

00:07:25.138 --> 00:07:26.807
Okay. Go get some rest.

00:07:27.542 --> 00:07:28.709
You too, Via.

00:07:28.734 --> 00:07:29.977
Yeah. I will. Later.

00:07:29.977 --> 00:07:31.001
Okay.

00:07:38.104 --> 00:07:40.648
I went through the same
thing with Mama before.

00:07:40.673 --> 00:07:44.427
Until now, I still
haven’t forgotten it.

00:07:45.421 --> 00:07:46.714
Is that Ivy Diaz?

00:07:47.053 --> 00:07:49.306
- That’s Ivy. The washed-up singer.
- Oh my gosh. Isn’t she past her prime?

00:07:49.331 --> 00:07:50.581
Dude, she’s outdated!

00:07:50.581 --> 00:07:52.307
What do you expect,
she got into drugs, man!

00:07:52.332 --> 00:07:54.459
- Hey, washed up!
- What is this?

00:07:54.459 --> 00:07:57.504
- She even has a guitar!
- Is this what being washed up looks like?

00:07:57.504 --> 00:08:01.633
Why don’t you just let her sing so
we can actually hear that voice of yours—

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:12.253
You’re washed up, and rude too.

00:08:47.471 --> 00:08:51.308
Why do they have to see me
crying and being treated like this?

00:08:52.225 --> 00:08:53.141
Via?

00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:55.562
Larkin!

00:08:57.543 --> 00:09:01.501
Tell your sister, she has
no right to ruin ArClea!

00:09:01.526 --> 00:09:03.111
Disgusting side-chick.

00:09:03.111 --> 00:09:04.571
What did you just say?

00:09:04.571 --> 00:09:05.405
Mira!

00:09:05.405 --> 00:09:06.852
- Hey, what are you doing—
- Mira!

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.659
They’re saying all kinds
of things about you

00:09:08.659 --> 00:09:10.369
when they don’t even know you!

00:09:10.369 --> 00:09:12.245
I can’t just let
them do that, Via.

00:09:14.563 --> 00:09:16.273
If I’m weak,

00:09:16.953 --> 00:09:17.871
what will happen to them?

00:09:17.896 --> 00:09:20.440
It feels like
everyone’s mad at me.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.276
It feels like everyone’s saying that—

00:09:23.276 --> 00:09:24.486
that I’m a slut.

00:09:24.486 --> 00:09:25.529
Fuck them!

00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:27.906
Who the hell are they to have
an opinion about you?

00:09:27.906 --> 00:09:29.533
Now that everything’s
out in the open,

00:09:29.533 --> 00:09:30.659
Larkin wants to quit.

00:09:30.659 --> 00:09:33.161
But he can’t because
we both signed a contract.

00:09:33.161 --> 00:09:37.249
You know all of this won’t
do him or his career any good.

00:09:37.249 --> 00:09:39.251
And for my career,

00:09:39.501 --> 00:09:40.877
I won’t let anyone ruin it.

00:09:41.211 --> 00:09:42.420
Not Larkin.

00:09:43.046 --> 00:09:44.047
Not Adi.

00:09:44.339 --> 00:09:45.590
Not anyone.

00:10:00.814 --> 00:10:01.815
Hello?

00:10:03.483 --> 00:10:04.693
Where are you?

00:10:06.111 --> 00:10:07.696
We need to talk.

00:10:09.155 --> 00:10:11.866
Via, I’m sorry.
I’m at a shoot right now.

00:10:11.866 --> 00:10:14.744
Did something happen?
Are you okay?

00:10:14.744 --> 00:10:16.705
I need to talk to you now.

00:10:17.497 --> 00:10:19.332
I’ll go there instead.

00:10:19.332 --> 00:10:20.500
I don’t care about your schedule.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.710
I don’t care if you’re busy.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.285
We need to talk right now.

00:10:26.256 --> 00:10:27.757
I’ll find a way.

00:10:28.091 --> 00:10:30.176
I’ll go to your house, Via.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.741
Via?

00:10:57.704 --> 00:10:58.705
Larkin.

00:11:28.109 --> 00:11:29.778
Can we still make this work?

00:11:45.845 --> 00:11:47.180
I can.

00:11:48.415 --> 00:11:49.416
You?

00:11:55.827 --> 00:11:57.870
I can’t do this anymore.

00:12:04.663 --> 00:12:06.415
It’s getting too much.

00:12:09.089 --> 00:12:10.632
Even my family

00:12:11.618 --> 00:12:13.245
is getting dragged into this.

00:12:24.681 --> 00:12:26.140
Maybe it’s time to stop.

00:12:29.339 --> 00:12:31.841
Just focus on your career.

00:12:37.262 --> 00:12:39.264
Tell them that we’re over.

00:12:40.272 --> 00:12:42.976
Be loyal to Clea instead.

00:12:42.976 --> 00:12:45.562
Tell them that she’s the
only woman in your life.

00:12:46.688 --> 00:12:47.731
Tell them.

00:12:48.976 --> 00:12:50.692
Say that there was never an us.

00:12:50.692 --> 00:12:51.804
Say that...

00:12:53.175 --> 00:12:55.595
Say that I was the one
who kept chasing after you.

00:12:56.197 --> 00:12:58.074
That I was the one
who kissed you that night.

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:09.897
Via, come on…

00:13:14.424 --> 00:13:15.425
I don’t want to.

00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:19.864
Don’t make me do that, Via.

00:13:23.099 --> 00:13:25.226
Don’t do this to me, too.
Asking me to do something

00:13:25.226 --> 00:13:26.603
I don’t want to do.

00:13:28.914 --> 00:13:31.124
But that’s what
will save your career.

00:13:37.568 --> 00:13:39.883
Do you think I want
what’s happening right now?

00:13:40.134 --> 00:13:43.762
I’m sacrificing myself
for your own good.

00:13:44.496 --> 00:13:47.665
Do you think I like being
stared at when I go outside?

00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:51.976
Being confronted, having things
thrown at me on the street?

00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:01.728
Kino, it hurts.

00:14:02.445 --> 00:14:04.272
It really hurts.

00:14:09.556 --> 00:14:10.932
Via, I’ll quit.

00:14:11.314 --> 00:14:13.066
I’ll give up my career. Everything.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.646
Just not this. Please?

00:14:15.902 --> 00:14:17.233
I don’t want this anymore.

00:14:17.862 --> 00:14:20.406
And I hate seeing you suffer
like this even more.

00:14:20.406 --> 00:14:21.783
so please, Via.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.151
Via—

00:14:27.497 --> 00:14:29.499
I can’t lose you, Via.

00:14:30.266 --> 00:14:32.393
Damn it. It hurts me
too when I read

00:14:32.418 --> 00:14:33.545
what people are saying,

00:14:33.545 --> 00:14:35.088
because I know
that’s not who you are.

00:14:36.589 --> 00:14:38.800
Do they even know
how you stepped up

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.552
as a mother to your siblings?

00:14:40.552 --> 00:14:42.262
Do they know everything
you went through?

00:14:42.262 --> 00:14:43.346
For your family?

00:14:43.346 --> 00:14:45.974
Have they seen how you love, Via?

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.099
Larkin, it already happened.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.743
Via, what can I do?

00:15:05.605 --> 00:15:08.483
Whatever it is, just tell me.
I’ll do anything.

00:15:09.664 --> 00:15:10.874
Via, please.

00:15:18.391 --> 00:15:19.392
Via—

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:26.647
I’ve managed to endure
all the pain before, right?

00:15:28.624 --> 00:15:30.668
I’ve endured everything.

00:15:33.361 --> 00:15:35.155
But with this, I can’t.

00:15:40.486 --> 00:15:41.571
I’m sorry.

00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:47.616
I’m sorry, I really
can’t do this anymore.

00:16:09.682 --> 00:16:12.018
I should be the one
apologizing to you.

00:16:13.397 --> 00:16:15.524
Your whole life,
I was right beside you.

00:16:16.725 --> 00:16:18.226
We’ve been together

00:16:19.154 --> 00:16:20.948
our whole lives.

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:28.780
But now that you’re
suffering this much,

00:16:28.805 --> 00:16:30.598
I’m not there for you.

00:16:34.067 --> 00:16:36.486
Via, I know I keep repeating
myself, but I’m sorry.

00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:41.792
I’m sorry that—

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.438
I’m sorry that until now,

00:16:46.463 --> 00:16:50.634
I still can’t stay by your side
while you face all of this.

00:17:13.448 --> 00:17:17.452
I promised myself I wouldn’t
let you go through this alone.

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:24.501
I’m sorry that now,
and in these past few days,

00:17:25.043 --> 00:17:26.878
I couldn’t even do that.

00:17:43.019 --> 00:17:45.188
I’m not used
to life without you.

00:17:47.774 --> 00:17:51.528
I never thought the
day would come

00:17:52.487 --> 00:17:54.948
when we’d be apart,
but here it is.

00:17:58.368 --> 00:18:01.955
I really want to stay by your side.

00:18:06.668 --> 00:18:10.088
I really want to, but I can’t anymore.

00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:59.054
In everything I do, I think of you.

00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:02.349
I’m sorry.

00:19:04.726 --> 00:19:07.312
I tried everything to protect you,

00:19:08.521 --> 00:19:11.149
but you’re still getting hurt.

00:19:40.262 --> 00:19:42.597
Thank you for staying by my side.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.438
But I think it’s time
to let you go.

00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.281
I love you as a friend,

00:19:59.781 --> 00:20:01.283
as a girlfriend,

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:04.119
as you, Via.

00:20:05.662 --> 00:20:07.080
I love you.

00:20:11.751 --> 00:20:13.253
And I’ll love you

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.589
until you’re able
to love yourself again.

00:21:13.521 --> 00:21:15.065
Can you handle it, Via?

00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:17.942
Can you handle
not having me around?

00:21:18.318 --> 00:21:20.111
Can you handle
not being with me?

00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:22.697
Via, I can handle it.

00:21:23.406 --> 00:21:24.908
But I didn’t say I wanted to.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.341
Why do you keep
following me around?

00:22:36.396 --> 00:22:39.399
Because we’re best friends.

00:22:40.024 --> 00:22:42.777
We go to school together
every day, don’t we?

00:22:42.777 --> 00:22:44.571
Since pre-school even, right?

00:22:44.571 --> 00:22:46.364
Then we should keep it
that way until college.

00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:48.116
And when we start working,
we’ll still go together.

00:22:48.116 --> 00:22:49.617
No excuses.

00:22:49.951 --> 00:22:52.162
Can’t you live without me?

00:22:52.354 --> 00:22:53.355
Nope.

00:23:02.714 --> 00:23:07.260
Friends?
We’re the best of friends!

00:23:07.677 --> 00:23:09.053
Our friendship won’t end

00:23:09.053 --> 00:23:10.763
just because of
a small misunderstanding.

00:23:10.974 --> 00:23:13.560
Even if we change a lot,

00:23:13.933 --> 00:23:14.809
no matter what happens,

00:23:14.809 --> 00:23:16.536
nothing changes
between us, okay?

00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:17.562
Promise?

00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:20.565
Promise.

00:23:33.786 --> 00:23:34.787
Via…

00:23:35.705 --> 00:23:37.540
I think I have feelings for you.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.125
You’re just confused.

00:23:39.125 --> 00:23:41.085
You don’t have
feelings for me, Kino.

00:23:45.507 --> 00:23:46.716
Via, I love you.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.885
Not just as a friend.

00:23:49.177 --> 00:23:50.803
I know you already know that,

00:23:51.262 --> 00:23:53.681
so why are you
still avoiding it?

00:23:57.101 --> 00:23:58.978
Damn it, Larkin.

00:23:59.145 --> 00:24:00.396
How do you really feel?

00:24:01.022 --> 00:24:02.065
Do you love me?

00:24:02.065 --> 00:24:03.148
Of course!

00:24:04.984 --> 00:24:06.819
We’re friends, aren’t we?

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.447
Push me away if you’re
not in love with me.

00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:21.501
Kino, I can’t do this anymore.

00:24:21.834 --> 00:24:23.878
I don’t want to be just a friend.

00:24:24.921 --> 00:24:26.256
Via, I love you.

00:24:27.006 --> 00:24:28.716
Let’s stop being friends now.

00:24:33.096 --> 00:24:36.182
I’ve written so many
songs about you,

00:24:36.808 --> 00:24:38.101
for you.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.853
I just want you to know that—

00:24:43.314 --> 00:24:47.819
I love you more than every
lyric I could ever write.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.989
And thank you

00:24:51.406 --> 00:24:54.367
for choosing to love me the most,

00:24:54.576 --> 00:24:56.995
even when so many
people already admire you.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.291
I love you so much, Kino.

00:25:16.321 --> 00:25:19.073
There’s still a whole
lifetime ahead of us, Via.

00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:22.562
And I’ll make sure

00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:27.108
we spend every
anniversary together.

00:25:27.358 --> 00:25:28.484
From the second,

00:25:28.484 --> 00:25:30.570
to the silver,

00:25:31.529 --> 00:25:34.032
even up to the
centennial anniversary.

00:25:35.825 --> 00:25:38.453
You’re the only one
I want to grow old with.

00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:06.773
Don’t take this off, okay?

00:26:07.982 --> 00:26:09.400
I’m your only best friend.

00:26:09.984 --> 00:26:11.319
Of course.

00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:13.446
It’s always been just you.

00:26:56.391 --> 00:26:58.602
This is it. It’s finally over.

00:26:59.103 --> 00:27:02.492
Five years we spent
together in this university.

00:27:02.517 --> 00:27:06.203
Five years of
struggling just to pass,

00:27:06.228 --> 00:27:08.921
staying up late
just to finish our plates.

00:27:08.946 --> 00:27:12.968
Five years of enduring
everything just to earn this diploma.

00:27:12.993 --> 00:27:14.055
And now… here we are.

00:27:14.266 --> 00:27:16.422
At last,
I’ve finished my studies.

00:27:16.829 --> 00:27:18.122
We’ve graduated.

00:27:18.388 --> 00:27:19.639
Together.

00:27:38.259 --> 00:27:39.574
I’m here again.

00:27:40.867 --> 00:27:42.619
I’m with all of our children.

00:27:45.163 --> 00:27:46.956
Via has already graduated.

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:51.002
I know you’d be happy right now.

00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:54.839
I wish you had
been there to see it.

00:28:00.719 --> 00:28:02.353
There’s nothing new about that.

00:28:02.378 --> 00:28:04.505
It’s not the only thing
she didn’t get to witness.

00:28:05.209 --> 00:28:07.711
She didn’t see
how I grew up either.

00:28:07.736 --> 00:28:11.282
How I took on all
the responsibilities at home.

00:28:11.307 --> 00:28:15.102
How I raised my siblings
and took care of Papa.

00:28:15.127 --> 00:28:18.881
How I kept everything
in our house together.

00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:29.207
Aren’t you going
to talk to your mom?

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:43.346
Come on, let’s go over there first.

00:29:05.201 --> 00:29:07.036
Was it all worth it, Ma?

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:13.126
When you think about
all the people you loved

00:29:13.126 --> 00:29:17.255
who slipped away while you
were busy chasing your dreams…

00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:21.217
Was it all worth it?

00:29:26.222 --> 00:29:29.142
I wanted you to
reach your dreams, too.

00:29:30.977 --> 00:29:33.563
I wanted you to be able
to do what you wanted.

00:29:37.984 --> 00:29:40.069
But was that
really the only way?

00:29:53.666 --> 00:29:56.294
Maybe that’s why
I never had big dreams.

00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:02.717
Maybe that’s why
I’m actually afraid to dream.

00:30:06.846 --> 00:30:09.557
Because I’m scared that
I might lose a part of me

00:30:09.557 --> 00:30:12.852
while I’m busy
chasing those dreams.

00:30:15.396 --> 00:30:17.607
My family. Arkin…

00:30:19.275 --> 00:30:20.652
Myself.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.363
Damn it.

00:30:25.448 --> 00:30:28.076
It’s really hard
when I love the people

00:30:28.076 --> 00:30:29.828
around me more
than I love myself…

00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:36.084
But you don’t need to worry.

00:30:41.881 --> 00:30:43.541
I’ll take care of my siblings.

00:30:46.636 --> 00:30:49.204
I’ll take care of them.
I’ll do everything.

00:30:49.229 --> 00:30:52.482
I’ll make sure
our lives will be okay.

00:30:53.309 --> 00:30:54.686
Even if it means

00:30:56.797 --> 00:30:58.924
I have to give up my dreams.

00:31:35.435 --> 00:31:36.978
You’re an architectural apprentice

00:31:36.978 --> 00:31:39.439
at Valeria Construction Group?

00:31:40.356 --> 00:31:41.357
Yes, ma’am.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.736
Then why are you
applying as a waitress?

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:48.408
Why don’t you just focus
on being an apprentice?

00:31:49.532 --> 00:31:53.077
It’s for extra income while
I’m still waiting for the board exams.

00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:55.955
I want to help my
family as soon as possible.

00:31:57.332 --> 00:31:58.333
Ma’am,

00:31:59.208 --> 00:32:02.170
I know I don’t have
any experience,

00:32:02.962 --> 00:32:05.214
but I promise I’m a fast learner.

00:32:05.214 --> 00:32:07.967
All right. You can
start tomorrow night.

00:32:07.967 --> 00:32:09.260
Really?

00:32:10.219 --> 00:32:11.220
Thank you so much, ma’am.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.513
I promise,
I’ll really do my best.

00:32:12.513 --> 00:32:14.015
All right. Do your best, okay?

00:32:14.015 --> 00:32:15.266
Thank you, ma’am.

00:32:26.611 --> 00:32:28.947
I want that scaled properly.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:32.334
I really don’t want
any last-minute corrections.

00:32:33.334 --> 00:32:37.296
Also, there’s a meeting tomorrow
with Mr. Dagdag at 10:00 a.m.

00:32:37.455 --> 00:32:40.333
Follow up as well if our meeting
with Mrs. Chang is still on.

00:32:40.416 --> 00:32:42.585
Did you get everything, Ms. Diaz?

00:32:43.544 --> 00:32:45.380
Ma’am, sorry, what was the—

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.589
Ma’am, sorry, what was
the last thing you said?

00:32:46.589 --> 00:32:47.882
I’m really sorry.

00:32:48.508 --> 00:32:50.510
Ms. Diaz, I know you’re new,

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:53.137
but in this job, you can’t be slow.

00:32:53.388 --> 00:32:54.389
Here.

00:32:54.741 --> 00:32:56.616
Prepare this entire deck

00:32:56.641 --> 00:32:58.685
for the son of
one of our clients.

00:32:58.685 --> 00:33:00.103
Present it to me
tomorrow morning

00:33:00.103 --> 00:33:02.689
before our meeting
with Mr. Dagdag.

00:33:02.689 --> 00:33:03.711
Yes, ma’am.

00:33:04.691 --> 00:33:05.692
Thank you, ma’am.

00:33:09.278 --> 00:33:10.258
Thank you.

00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:16.411
Welcome.

00:33:16.411 --> 00:33:18.121
Reservation for Sir Chris?

00:33:18.121 --> 00:33:19.080
Yes, please.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.123
All right, right this way.

00:33:20.123 --> 00:33:21.332
Here you go.

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:22.834
Thank you.

00:33:23.209 --> 00:33:24.335
Ma’am, here’s our menu.

00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:26.087
Please call me when
you’re ready to order.

00:33:26.087 --> 00:33:27.046
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

00:33:27.046 --> 00:33:28.446
Miss, can you
follow up on this, please?

00:33:28.818 --> 00:33:30.278
- Just a moment, please.
- Thank you.

00:33:34.637 --> 00:33:36.014
Here’s your order, sir.

00:33:36.639 --> 00:33:37.807
Thank you. Enjoy!

00:33:37.807 --> 00:33:38.808
Thank you so much.

00:33:41.602 --> 00:33:42.603
You still good?

00:33:42.937 --> 00:33:44.480
I’ll take over here for now.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.940
Go get some rest for a bit.

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:48.401
I’m okay. Thanks.

00:33:48.401 --> 00:33:49.532
You sure?

00:33:49.652 --> 00:33:50.820
All right, I’ll stay here then.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.905
- Thanks.
- Miss, excuse me!

00:33:52.905 --> 00:33:54.282
We’re ready to order.

00:33:54.532 --> 00:33:55.533
Just a moment, please.

00:33:57.611 --> 00:33:59.196
What would you
like to order, ma’am?

00:33:59.566 --> 00:34:03.361
Two classic beef burgers,
and two tuna aglio olio.

00:34:04.292 --> 00:34:05.293
All right.

00:34:08.504 --> 00:34:09.505
Thank you.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:13.694
You can do this, Via.
Just a little more.

00:35:14.487 --> 00:35:16.948
You can do this.
This isn’t just for your dreams,

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:18.866
it’s for your family too.

00:35:19.867 --> 00:35:21.235
Hang in there.

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:25.957
You can do this.

00:36:11.364 --> 00:36:12.391
Via?

00:36:13.254 --> 00:36:14.005
Huh?

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:15.907
You’re not asleep yet?

00:36:17.091 --> 00:36:18.467
I’ll sleep in a bit.

00:36:19.135 --> 00:36:21.012
I’m just finishing packing your food.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.514
Via, you have work later.

00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:25.892
You should rest first.

00:36:27.393 --> 00:36:28.750
I’m fine.

00:36:31.564 --> 00:36:33.858
Oh no, it’s okay. Mira,
I’ll do it. I’ve got it.

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:35.026
- It’s okay.
- This is easy, Via.

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:35.776
I’ll do it, I’ll do it.

00:36:35.776 --> 00:36:37.695
It’s okay, it’s okay.

00:36:38.446 --> 00:36:40.698
Via, can you teach me
how to cook rice?

00:36:40.862 --> 00:36:45.450
And how to fry food,
and all the house chores.

00:36:45.745 --> 00:36:46.954
I already know how,

00:36:46.954 --> 00:36:49.457
but I still want to learn more.

00:36:51.292 --> 00:36:53.836
Why do you suddenly
want me to teach you?

00:36:53.836 --> 00:36:55.671
Why do you suddenly
want to learn?

00:36:55.963 --> 00:36:59.717
So when you’re busy or tired,

00:37:00.259 --> 00:37:02.845
I’ll be here to help you.

00:37:08.726 --> 00:37:09.727
Mira—

00:37:11.062 --> 00:37:12.521
I’m okay.

00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:14.357
I can handle it.

00:37:15.524 --> 00:37:16.984
Just get some rest for now.

00:37:16.984 --> 00:37:17.860
Go to sleep.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.738
Get more sleep so you’ll
have energy for school.

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:23.324
But I want to help, Via.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.203
I understand you. Don’t worry.

00:37:28.704 --> 00:37:31.666
I know you’ve already
made so many sacrifices

00:37:31.666 --> 00:37:33.042
for our family.

00:37:34.377 --> 00:37:36.453
Didn’t you say it yourself

00:37:36.712 --> 00:37:39.674
that it’s just us
helping each other, right?

00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:42.510
So please let me help too,

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.595
even if it’s just a little.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:53.771
Okay, come here.

00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:57.566
This is really easy.
I know you can manage.

00:37:57.692 --> 00:38:00.403
But you don’t have to
do it all the time, okay?

00:38:00.695 --> 00:38:01.727
Okay.

00:38:02.219 --> 00:38:04.073
I already put in two cups.

00:38:04.699 --> 00:38:06.492
Rinse the rice twice, then drain.

00:38:06.492 --> 00:38:10.680
Add in two cups of water after.

00:38:11.163 --> 00:38:13.207
The ratio of rice
to water is one to one.

00:38:13.207 --> 00:38:14.208
Like this?

00:38:14.208 --> 00:38:15.001
Wash it first.

00:38:15.001 --> 00:38:16.460
- Doesn’t matter how much water you use.
- Okay.

00:38:17.503 --> 00:38:18.504
And then—

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.590
So that’s how it is.

00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:25.094
This is easy. I can do this.

00:38:35.563 --> 00:38:37.266
Now don’t spill the rice.

00:38:43.946 --> 00:38:46.741
Your presentation
was kind of good,

00:38:46.741 --> 00:38:48.659
but it still needs polishing.

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:52.121
You’re a Panther alumna, right?

00:38:52.788 --> 00:38:53.852
Yes, ma’am.

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:57.696
We always expect excellence
from España graduates.

00:38:57.916 --> 00:39:00.293
As the seniors here like to say,

00:39:00.318 --> 00:39:02.703
mediocrity has no place here.

00:39:03.924 --> 00:39:07.136
So next time,
you know what to do. Okay?

00:39:07.561 --> 00:39:08.613
Yes, ma’am.

00:39:08.637 --> 00:39:09.430
Excuse me.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.515
I’ll do better next time. Thank you, ma’am.

00:39:23.449 --> 00:39:26.452
Oh my gosh. Larkin is speaking!

00:39:26.614 --> 00:39:27.698
I told you!

00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:28.491
Don’t be loud.

00:39:28.491 --> 00:39:29.664
Jeez! Okay, fine.

00:39:31.327 --> 00:39:33.662
I just want to repeat that
Clea and I weren’t official

00:39:33.662 --> 00:39:35.039
when that incident happened.

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:36.999
And to answer your question,

00:39:37.249 --> 00:39:39.502
the woman in the photo
is my childhood friend.

00:39:39.697 --> 00:39:41.490
So, we’ve been
close for a long time.

00:39:41.921 --> 00:39:44.006
Okay, so what happened?

00:39:44.006 --> 00:39:45.466
Why does the photo
look like that?

00:39:46.092 --> 00:39:48.594
She was drunk back then,
so that’s how it happened.

00:39:48.594 --> 00:39:51.639
Clea already knows about it.
I told her, so we’re okay.

00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:53.933
Clea and I are okay,
and that’s what’s important.

00:39:54.392 --> 00:39:57.812
And I’m not in contact
with that friend anymore,

00:39:57.812 --> 00:40:01.148
so please, stop going after her.

00:40:20.876 --> 00:40:22.503
Girl, you still okay?

00:40:23.462 --> 00:40:24.463
Still fighting.

00:40:27.466 --> 00:40:29.301
Ma’am, excuse me,
this is our last call.

00:40:29.301 --> 00:40:30.428
If you want—

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:33.722
- Did you miss me?
- Sam!

00:40:33.722 --> 00:40:35.933
Hi! Hello!

00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:40.020
What are you doing here?

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.647
I heard you work here,

00:40:41.647 --> 00:40:44.984
and I just got back from an
out-of-the-country business trip.

00:40:44.984 --> 00:40:47.820
And I wanted to
give you your souvenir.

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.073
Thank you.

00:40:51.282 --> 00:40:52.241
Are you ordering something?

00:40:52.241 --> 00:40:53.784
I’ll ask if we can still make it

00:40:53.784 --> 00:40:56.078
since the kitchen
already took last orders.

00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:59.623
Via, I know you need
a friend right now,

00:41:00.348 --> 00:41:01.975
and I’m here to listen.

00:41:10.844 --> 00:41:12.261
Samantha Vera?

00:41:12.595 --> 00:41:14.597
Ma’am, it’s Sam!

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.115
Let’s take a picture, come on!

00:41:18.267 --> 00:41:19.810
Ms. Sam,
can we take a photo?

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:20.811
Sure.

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:22.649
Come on, come on.

00:41:23.772 --> 00:41:24.482
There.

00:41:24.482 --> 00:41:26.233
One more. One, two—

00:41:26.609 --> 00:41:29.111
One, two… There you go.

00:41:29.111 --> 00:41:29.904
Thank you.

00:41:29.904 --> 00:41:31.113
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

00:41:31.113 --> 00:41:32.907
- Thank you! Let’s go.
- Thank you.

00:41:45.085 --> 00:41:47.087
Good thing you agreed
to do a video greeting

00:41:47.087 --> 00:41:48.506
for the owner’s child.

00:41:48.506 --> 00:41:51.133
I was finally allowed
to take a break.

00:41:59.391 --> 00:42:00.392
How are you?

00:42:02.795 --> 00:42:03.796
Huh?

00:42:06.732 --> 00:42:08.108
I’m okay, I guess.

00:42:09.777 --> 00:42:10.977
I’m still managing.

00:42:13.217 --> 00:42:14.218
You?

00:42:15.308 --> 00:42:16.559
How are you?

00:42:17.885 --> 00:42:18.961
Busy.

00:42:19.453 --> 00:42:20.766
But I can manage.

00:42:26.101 --> 00:42:27.102
Hey.

00:42:28.212 --> 00:42:30.589
If you need someone
to talk to, I’m here.

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:33.217
You know that, right?

00:42:33.758 --> 00:42:35.803
Please don’t keep it all inside.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:40.683
You too.

00:42:42.203 --> 00:42:44.562
Don’t keep everything
to yourself either, okay?

00:42:45.187 --> 00:42:46.814
You always tell other people that,

00:42:46.839 --> 00:42:50.134
but you never do it for yourself.

00:42:52.129 --> 00:42:53.631
Yes, it’s hard.

00:42:54.196 --> 00:42:55.739
We want to hide everything

00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:57.908
because we don’t want
to burden other people.

00:42:59.443 --> 00:43:02.321
But, like you said,

00:43:03.239 --> 00:43:05.157
it’s hard to keep
everything to yourself.

00:43:06.258 --> 00:43:07.876
So, I’m here.

00:43:07.876 --> 00:43:10.796
Just tell me whenever
you’re ready.

00:43:13.145 --> 00:43:14.146
Thank you.

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:19.430
But...

00:43:20.222 --> 00:43:21.724
I’m worrying more about you.

00:43:24.852 --> 00:43:28.439
I actually visited Arkin
as soon as I got back.

00:43:29.825 --> 00:43:31.535
He looks fine,

00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:37.489
but he kept asking me
to check on you.

00:43:37.781 --> 00:43:40.409
- All he could talk about was you—
- Sam.

00:43:45.286 --> 00:43:47.664
I didn’t really want to
talk about that anymore.

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:56.884
I also ran into Clea.

00:43:58.272 --> 00:43:59.273
You know what,

00:44:00.176 --> 00:44:03.388
I understand why she
wants to protect her image.

00:44:05.517 --> 00:44:08.270
She was raised to be a celebrity

00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:10.105
ever since she was a kid.

00:44:10.872 --> 00:44:14.501
She worked hard
and achieved all of this.

00:44:15.694 --> 00:44:17.905
So, are you mad at her?

00:44:20.282 --> 00:44:22.201
Why would I be mad at her

00:44:22.201 --> 00:44:27.206
when all she did was
cover for and protect us?

00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:30.751
I understand

00:44:32.961 --> 00:44:34.797
where she’s coming from.

00:44:35.303 --> 00:44:39.526
And if what we did
ends up ruining her career,

00:44:39.551 --> 00:44:44.382
then we really
need to stop, right?

00:44:50.696 --> 00:44:51.697
Okay.

00:44:52.314 --> 00:44:54.858
If this makes you feel better—

00:44:56.927 --> 00:44:58.470
Clea likes someone else.

00:44:58.773 --> 00:45:01.323
Adonis. You know him, right?

00:45:02.074 --> 00:45:04.827
Adi, my ex-crush?

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:08.237
Back in college.

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:11.166
Remember? Okay.

00:45:11.917 --> 00:45:14.753
Well, I don’t think
her feelings for him

00:45:14.753 --> 00:45:17.214
will go away anytime soon.

00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:19.007
And I think Adi feels the same.

00:45:20.259 --> 00:45:23.971
He’s just trying to stop her
from doing impulsive things.

00:45:23.971 --> 00:45:26.014
She has a contract, so—

00:45:26.348 --> 00:45:29.435
So he couldn’t be with her either.

00:45:29.435 --> 00:45:32.396
Turns out he’s struggling
with the situation too,

00:45:32.423 --> 00:45:34.216
he just doesn’t show it.

00:45:34.898 --> 00:45:36.775
Adonis and I are kind of similar.

00:45:36.775 --> 00:45:43.000
The difference is, I tried. He didn’t.

00:45:43.025 --> 00:45:47.859
I wish I hadn’t gotten
myself into this situation.

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:50.414
I didn’t realize I couldn’t handle it.

00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:54.501
I’m not mad at Clea.

00:45:55.919 --> 00:45:59.047
Please tell her,
in case she thinks that.

00:46:02.301 --> 00:46:05.095
For now, I’m just going
to focus on my apprenticeship

00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:06.597
and my part-time job.

00:46:07.918 --> 00:46:10.504
At least I’m able to help Papa now.

00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:16.148
We’re all proud of you, Via.

00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:21.278
And if you need anything,
I’m right here.

00:46:22.321 --> 00:46:24.740
Don’t be shy, just tell me.

00:46:26.325 --> 00:46:29.369
Thank you, Sam. You’ve already
helped us so much.

00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:31.705
I’m managing for now.

00:46:32.164 --> 00:46:34.124
We even have
extra pay this weekend

00:46:34.124 --> 00:46:35.667
because we’re going
to be catering an event.

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:39.171
But thank you, really. Thanks a lot.

00:46:40.255 --> 00:46:41.256
Of course.

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:46.094
Aren’t you jet-lagged?

00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:47.638
Not really.

00:46:48.388 --> 00:46:52.267
I really came to give you
your gift and to check on you.

00:46:53.143 --> 00:46:54.353
It’s been a while.

00:46:54.353 --> 00:46:55.896
Thank you.

00:46:56.104 --> 00:46:57.105
Of course.

00:47:01.819 --> 00:47:05.322
A lot of people are asking
how one became successful—

00:47:05.322 --> 00:47:06.494
a Filipina architect abroad.

00:47:06.518 --> 00:47:08.534
Who do you think our
surprise guest will be?

00:47:08.534 --> 00:47:10.327
- I don’t know, but—
-I heard it’s a famous singer.

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:13.914
- It started the day I chose to leave.
- I hope he’s handsome!

00:47:15.457 --> 00:47:18.752
Those days were
extremely hard and heavy.

00:47:19.795 --> 00:47:21.380
To risk everything

00:47:22.381 --> 00:47:25.592
and leave the life I was used to.

00:47:27.386 --> 00:47:29.680
Especially the
people I loved here.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.773
Spain is not easy.

00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:36.770
I started all over again from scratch.

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:41.692
But it gave me space
and room to grow.

00:47:41.942 --> 00:47:43.277
And eventually,

00:47:43.652 --> 00:47:47.364
it gave me a chance
to build something real.

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:49.241
Not just buildings,

00:47:49.908 --> 00:47:54.162
but also a life I can be proud of.

00:47:55.455 --> 00:48:01.023
I didn’t just build
projects for my clients.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:06.383
I was also able to build
a home for my parents.

00:48:06.842 --> 00:48:10.888
And I was able to help
my siblings finish school.

00:48:11.575 --> 00:48:13.077
And if you ask me

00:48:13.974 --> 00:48:17.019
if I would make that
same decision again?

00:48:17.748 --> 00:48:19.250
Most definitely—

00:48:20.522 --> 00:48:21.523
Yes!

00:48:23.025 --> 00:48:24.026
Thank you.

00:48:27.696 --> 00:48:29.656
Thank you for that
inspiring message,

00:48:29.656 --> 00:48:31.158
Architect Kaydee Benito.

00:48:31.617 --> 00:48:33.327
All right, everyone.

00:48:33.785 --> 00:48:37.331
We have a very special
guest to serenade us.

00:48:37.331 --> 00:48:40.918
To sing his newest song,
“Under The Moonlight”

00:48:40.918 --> 00:48:42.628
let us all welcome—

00:48:42.628 --> 00:48:44.421
Larkin Sanchez!

00:48:59.353 --> 00:49:01.146
Hi, this is Larkin Sanchez,

00:49:01.146 --> 00:49:03.857
paying tribute to all architects.

00:49:04.149 --> 00:49:06.985
I know the hard work you
all went through to get to

00:49:06.985 --> 00:49:08.362
where you are today.

00:49:09.071 --> 00:49:10.822
I’m going to sing
my newest song,

00:49:10.822 --> 00:49:12.282
“Under The Moonlight.”

00:49:14.409 --> 00:49:16.745
This song is about

00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:19.790
begging for someone to stay.

00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:26.254
He’s remembering all the
promises they made together.

00:49:26.838 --> 00:49:29.591
The promise that
they would stay together.

00:49:30.592 --> 00:49:32.844
Like how the lyrics go,

00:49:33.512 --> 00:49:37.015
“didn’t you say
we’d grow old together?”

00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:40.686
“Didn’t you promise that
neither of us would give up?”

00:49:41.019 --> 00:49:44.690
“Didn’t you say you
loved me and all our plans?

00:49:45.565 --> 00:49:46.566
Didn’t you?”

00:49:47.025 --> 00:49:48.026
Music, please.

00:49:50.988 --> 00:49:52.406
I love you!

Damn it, Larkin!

00:54:58.081 --> 00:54:59.749
You’re so careless!

00:55:00.255 --> 00:55:00.880
What was that?

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.382
Dating behind the camera?

00:55:02.382 --> 00:55:03.466
Is that true?

00:55:03.466 --> 00:55:05.635
Did you forget you have Clea?

00:55:06.511 --> 00:55:08.013
Larkin, what is this?

00:55:10.098 --> 00:55:13.685
Do you think you can survive
all of this crap without my help?

00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:15.812
I had to cut my trip
to the States short

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:18.189
just to be here
and fix everything!

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:19.741
Just so you know,

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.068
the endorsements
you and Clea have,

00:55:22.068 --> 00:55:23.212
they’re threatening to pull out.

00:55:23.237 --> 00:55:24.279
What are you going to do?

00:55:25.655 --> 00:55:26.656
What?

00:55:27.449 --> 00:55:29.993
There, there,
that look on your face.

00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:32.540
That face. So I’m the
one fixing this again?

00:55:32.565 --> 00:55:33.566
As always!

00:55:34.205 --> 00:55:36.249
Yes, sir, we’re already
working on it.

00:55:36.249 --> 00:55:39.002
- Yes.
- Good job.

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:41.421
Yes.

00:55:41.989 --> 00:55:43.324
From now on,

00:55:43.767 --> 00:55:46.790
you’re not touching that phone
without my consent.

00:55:46.815 --> 00:55:50.402
And you’ll be staying in
a hotel with your road manager

00:55:50.527 --> 00:55:51.403
so you can be monitored,

00:55:51.428 --> 00:55:53.013
because you might
mess things up again!

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:55.415
- Sir, can’t we—
- No.

00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.376
- Sir, maybe we can—
- Give it to me!

00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:59.191
Give it to me!

00:55:59.656 --> 00:56:00.740
Give it to me!

00:56:00.765 --> 00:56:01.766
Sir, please.

00:56:02.922 --> 00:56:04.090
I’m sorry, Larkin!

00:56:04.743 --> 00:56:05.927
You made me do this.

00:56:07.223 --> 00:56:08.641
Things will get worse.

00:56:11.691 --> 00:56:12.692
Joey!

00:56:17.564 --> 00:56:18.648
That too. Give it to me.

00:56:20.426 --> 00:56:21.386
Give it!

00:56:21.826 --> 00:56:24.078
- Sir, I’ll just keep it—
- Give that to me!

00:56:24.103 --> 00:56:25.271
Give it!

00:56:25.296 --> 00:56:26.738
Sir, I just won’t
wear it outside.

00:56:26.763 --> 00:56:27.764
Sir, please—

00:56:28.565 --> 00:56:29.774
Just listen to me!

00:56:29.799 --> 00:56:31.384
Who’s the manager
between the two of us?

00:56:32.639 --> 00:56:34.140
Where’s your bracelet?

00:56:34.766 --> 00:56:38.314
Shit. I lost it, Via. I’m sorry.

00:56:40.921 --> 00:56:42.465
I’m not just
protecting you here,

00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:44.317
I’m also protecting your girl.

00:56:44.979 --> 00:56:47.232
And is that woman
really that important?

00:56:47.257 --> 00:56:49.008
That you’d risk your own career?

00:56:49.033 --> 00:56:50.702
Everything we worked for?

00:56:52.915 --> 00:56:53.916
Larkin.

00:56:55.265 --> 00:56:56.475
That woman

00:56:57.283 --> 00:56:58.952
will be the end of you.

00:57:06.996 --> 00:57:11.587
That woman is my beginning, sir.

00:57:45.493 --> 00:57:47.282
You went through a lot together,

00:57:48.295 --> 00:57:50.814
but just like that, she ‘s gone.

00:57:51.426 --> 00:57:54.053
Love is so unfair.

00:57:55.513 --> 00:57:57.307
Nothing ever lasts in this world.

00:57:57.307 --> 00:57:58.558
I’m done too.

00:58:00.101 --> 00:58:02.061
Am I a bad person?

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:04.105
We promised a future together.

00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:07.734
How am I supposed
to get used to this?

00:58:08.868 --> 00:58:10.578
You won’t get used to it, bro.

00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:17.494
Go see Arkin and say goodbye.

00:58:25.454 --> 00:58:26.455
Hi.

00:58:29.047 --> 00:58:30.048
Via?
