WEBVTT

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.260
Where are you going?

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.500
To get you some medicine.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.500
I've been feeling out of it all day.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.210
My notes are a total mess.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.950
But I was listening to
the teacher, I swear.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.900
It's not that bad, anyway.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.590
I didn't want to be a bother to everyone.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.300
It's okay.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.540
You did great.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.620
Kiss me again.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.640
I brought back some tamagoyaki.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.580
Take your medicine after you eat.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.920
Want some help?

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.020
No, I'm good.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.040
This is...

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.780
This is all your fault, Sara-senpai.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.220
That's exactly why I'm helping you.

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:35.803
But you still need to take your medicine.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.640
I don't think I can right now...

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.470
Let me just... calm down first.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.690
What were you doing just now?

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.110
Next time you're not feeling well,

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.790
you have to tell me right away.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.450
I'm fine.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.010
I know I worried you this time,

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.190
but I'm used to handling things on my own.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.580
Well, you have me now.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.140
Will you always be by my side?

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.050
Just kidding.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.620
Forget I said that.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.120
Fu.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.760
Just for tonight.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.480
Just stay with me tonight.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.040
I'll stay with you.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.410
I'll be right here.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.530
Just focus on getting better.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.500
"The Boy Next World My Destiny"
(Episode 5)

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.600
Morning.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.190
How's your cold?

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.860
Is your fever gone?

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.850
What are you talking about?

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.740
And what's with that wound?

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.140
Huh?

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.590
You're acting really strange.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.320
Fu...

00:07:13.523 --> 00:07:14.883
It's like he's a different person.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:16.940
Fu!

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.440
Wait, we need to talk.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.180
How does it feel?

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:49.690
What?

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.070
How does it feel to
peek into a parallel world?

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:57.870
What are you talking about?

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.000
You have Fu with you.

00:08:03.403 --> 00:08:05.423
I once had a future with him, too.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.110
Stop being such a coward.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:24.890
Not again...

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.170
I'm sorry.

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:41.670
I had that same dream again.

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:44.610
That's why I wanted to believe...

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.730
that we really were a couple.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.470
Sorry, I'm just being selfish.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.730
I just don't want us to be strangers again.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.829
That last scene was so cool.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.739
And then the camera slowly pulls back...

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.629
and then—bam!—that wide shot hits.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.389
With the deep narration
and music, I was a mess.

00:09:43.413 --> 00:09:44.719
The teacher's gonna scold you.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.820
Man, you're such a teacher's pet.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:50.690
Hey, wait!

00:09:52.212 --> 00:09:53.752
Hey! No running in the halls!

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.170
Sorry!

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:56.530
Give it back!

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.220
Hey, did you hear about the mock exam?

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.786
Someone got a perfect
score in every subject.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:03.630
Sara-senpai?

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.439
He's so perfect it's actually creepy.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.999
Yeah, it's insane.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.510
Hey, get back to sweeping.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.010
Oh, right. Sorry.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.240
It's annoying because Fu works so hard.

00:10:18.425 --> 00:10:20.165
That's exactly what's so annoying.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.860
What?

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.140
Maybe Senpai works hard too.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.690
You guys don't know anything, so shut up.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.500
What were you doing?

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.990
I'm making a paper cup phone.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.770
This way we can talk whenever we want.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.560
Fu.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:28.210
I have something to tell you.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:32.850
What is it?

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:37.370
Never mind.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.240
What was that about?

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.960
Button.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.620
Shower.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:10.490
I need to go take a shower.

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:12.040
I'm heading out.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.890
I'm just a substitute.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.090
Just a stand-in.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.840
Until Senpai goes back to his own world.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.320
Didn't we buy way too much?

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.540
You just got over being sick.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.340
This is a bit much...

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:41.130
It's fine.

00:12:41.131 --> 00:12:43.200
You need to eat a lot
to get your energy back.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.800
So...

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.050
did you invite him?

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:47.440
No.

00:12:47.441 --> 00:12:49.080
He was already there when I got to Fu's.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:03.100
Why was Sara-senpai at Fu's house?

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.379
He stayed over to take care of me.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.420
- He stayed over?!
- What?!

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.509
They live in the same building.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:09.710
- The same building?!
- No way!

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:18.490
Let's eat.

00:13:18.491 --> 00:13:20.589
- Let's eat.
- Which one should I pick?

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:22.390
- I'll take that one.
- Which one?

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:24.510
That one's fine. Anything's fine.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:25.910
Don't just throw it!

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.070
So, did you guys finally do it?

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.320
Fu...

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.850
I'm so happy for you.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.170
What?

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.940
Oh, so you didn't sleep in the same room.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.090
Fu, you're so innocent
it's actually worrying.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.570
He's eating slower than usual.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.900
He might not be fully recovered yet.

00:13:54.543 --> 00:13:55.963
Once Fu is feeling better,

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.270
I'll explain everything to him.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.150
It's been a while since I've had rice.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:15.890
This is so good.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.420
Is no one else hungry?

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.130
Hey, Sara.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.650
I heard you went back home yesterday.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:38.960
I was worried, man.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.320
I thought you were being
held captive or something.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.080
She told me not to see my dad.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:48.870
What?

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.870
Didn't your dad go all
that way just to see you?

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.350
That robot old hag...

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:54.880
she doesn't care at all.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.940
Is that all you have to say?

00:14:55.941 --> 00:14:57.010
Wait, don't hang up!

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.020
For Friday's second period Finance class...

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.910
the professor said your
attendance is too low.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.410
This week,

00:15:02.411 --> 00:15:04.280
you absolutely have to show up.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.580
Got it.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.339
I actually got called in for that.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.390
And I'm not even taking that class!

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:12.949
You really need to make some friends

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:14.730
other than me in your classes.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:16.310
Want to go see a movie?

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:21.950
Who is this?

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.750
There's a film festival I'm interested in.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.080
I thought you might like it, Taiga-senpai.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:27.910
You're the one from...

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.830
Why do you have his phone?

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.529
I didn't want to hear Taiga-senpai nagging,

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:34.980
so I just picked up.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.540
So, how about that movie?

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.120
Like I'd go with you.

00:15:47.773 --> 00:15:48.973
Do you think he'll say yes?

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.560
Ask him yourself.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.150
Are you intentionally trying
not to think about anything?

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.360
You were thinking so much
when you were with Fu.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.990
If Taiga-senpai won't go,
I'll just have to ask Fu instead.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.920
Please don't even joke about that.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:14.780
I'll figure something out.

00:16:21.382 --> 00:16:23.702
What did Taiga-senpai say on the phone?

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.900
Oh.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.530
He asked if I was okay after seeing my mom.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.030
He's always worrying about nothing.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.880
Why would he be worried?

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.020
My mom...

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.680
she doesn't even see me as a human being.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.260
What do you mean?

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.090
When I was eight,

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.020
my parents got divorced.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.020
My mom took me,

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.810
and my brother stayed with my dad.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.050
You have a brother?

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.050
We don't see each other much.

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:14.290
I don't want him getting dragged into this.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.400
Into what? With your mom?

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.570
I was always forced
to do nothing but study.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:32.650
Back in middle school,

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.310
Taiga and I made a plan

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.990
to skip school and go out.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:40.430
Yeah?

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.540
That woman...

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.240
she had her people beat me.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:49.970
Right in front of Taiga.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.840
"Don't think. Just obey."

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:01.650
That's her favorite thing to say.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.420
If you just take it all,

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.140
life is easier if you just follow orders.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:14.810
That's how she forced me to see things.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.440
Let's go.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.199
(Arakawa Amusement Park)

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.680
Come on, let's go.

00:18:39.213 --> 00:18:40.213
Hurry up!

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.450
No, that's not right. Like this.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.440
There you go.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:49.550
I'm definitely not losing.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:50.990
I'm going to win for sure.

00:18:51.376 --> 00:18:53.136
- Is that how it works?
- Yeah.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.340
You have to teach me.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.400
Honestly...

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.770
Pay attention, okay?

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:01.110
Thanks.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.080
What's this?

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:06.810
Open it and see.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.760
Here.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.580
Are you sure?

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.390
It's for you.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.020
Thank you.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.330
Sara-senpai.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:34.250
Sara-senpai!

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.300
You smiled!

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.720
Hey, let's play again.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.810
One more time.

00:19:48.811 --> 00:19:50.410
Please? Just one more time.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:52.960
Sara-senpai, please!

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.380
Just once more.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:06.950
We haven't ridden the dinosaur one yet.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.720
We still need to go on
the dinosaur carousel.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:15.430
It's already closed.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.620
- Hey.
- Yeah?

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:21.780
Let's go again.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:23.980
Again?

00:20:24.102 --> 00:20:26.252
Yeah, just one more time.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:29.890
One more time.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.460
One more time!

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.940
One more time, one more time!

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:43.670
Here.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.990
Wow, Sara-senpai, you're terrible at this.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:47.960
Give it here.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.460
Honestly, let me help you.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.140
Okay, here we go.

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.520
See? You have to do it like this.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:55.630
Try again. There.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.110
You got it, you got it.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:58.890
We did it! We did it!

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.610
Alpacas are so cute, right?

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:02.850
Yeah.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.240
Their faces are so long.

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:13.910
Come on.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.990
Just touch the screen to start.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:28.330
Okay, get ready.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.180
- Smile! Smile!
- We're taking the picture!

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.300
Three, two, one!

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.730
This is how it turned out.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.370
Don't look so grumpy.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.170
Look at the camera and smile.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:43.050
I am smiling.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.820
Your smile is way gentler
when you're with Fu.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.720
Look, look! Strike a pose.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.360
Three, two, one!

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.590
This is how it turned out.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.300
Is this no good?

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.030
It's not that it's no good...

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.240
This next one is the last one.

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:08.020
I actually like this one.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.620
Three, two, one!

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.440
Is this really your first
time taking sticker photos?

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.990
I'm keeping this one.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.870
In exchange for that bear.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:42.550
Are you mad?

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:46.550
I'm just shy.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.480
Did you have fun?

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.430
It was the best day of my life.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.560
You're Fu Yotsuba, right?

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:22.140
Yes... Who are you?

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.210
I'm an attendant for the Kogami family.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.680
His mother would like to know

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:32.670
how much money it will take

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.030
for you to disappear from her son's life.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.400
(Career Preference Survey)

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.120
You...

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:59.290
Are you really going to
do what that old hag says?

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.990
Taiga-senpai.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:11.546
Here's the sign-up
sheet for the sports meet.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.020
Oh, thanks.

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:14.430
Excuse me.

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.970
Fu, do you already have a college in mind?

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:21.950
Yeah, I want to go to the
same one my dad went to.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.600
I'm rooting for you.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.430
Thank you.
