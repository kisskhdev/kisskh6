WEBVTT

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:31.679
Come on, slow down, kids.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.119
The stairs are dark, watch your step.

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:35.799
Go to sleep early, kids.

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:38.920
So pretty.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.399
You can put your luggage anywhere.

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:43.359
You can put it in that corner.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.799
Second floor.

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:46.600
Everyone will stay here tonight.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.799
Okay.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.320
Thank you, Auntie.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.439
Xiao Yin, take good care of them.

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.880
Okay.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.479
Mom's leaving now.

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:52.079
Bye-bye.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.920
Bye-bye, Auntie.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.479
Bye-bye.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.399
Get some sleep early.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.000
Xiao Yin.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.280
I knew your family was rich,

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.640
but I didn't expect *this* rich.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.120
It's nothing, it's nothing.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.480
Please let me cling to your thigh.

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:10.599
Finally, one of my sisters is rich.

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:13.359
But actually, this homestay isn't that great.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.959
It's okay during peak season,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.719
but there's barely anyone in the off-season.

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:18.280
And this whole big area,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.879
is managed by just my mom and dad.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:20.959
It's actually pretty hard work.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:22.840
Just two people for such a big place?

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:24.439
That is true.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.319
But it's kept so clean.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.079
Yeah.

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:28.000
It's really pretty.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.599
Since

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.359
we're staying right by the sea now,

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:32.560
why don't we go take photos tomorrow?

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:33.400
Sure!

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.319
Yeah, let's do it.

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:35.599
I also want to eat Qingbuliang.

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:36.239
Qingbuliang.

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:37.680
There's a place called Grandma's Qingbuliang.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.040
It's super good. Highly recommended.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.200
Really? Where is it?

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:41.480
It's a bit far.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.040
But

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.840
there's a fried ice shop nearby.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.319
It's five or six hundred meters on foot.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:46.319
We can go eat fried ice first.

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:47.480
Okay.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.719
I brought a lot of little dresses.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.560
Let's take a look.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.840
They'll look amazing in photos tomorrow.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.480
Me too, me too. Resort style.

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:54.159
I'll get them for you.

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:55.799
Wait a second.

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:57.439
The senior sent a notification.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.400
Says we have to gather at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:01.159
Six o'clock?

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.000
Six o'clock.

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.920
Then...

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.319
Then why bother sleeping?

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.000
Students,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.199
Hainan is a blessed land for us agriculture students.

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.599
Look at that patch behind us.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.000
That's the jackfruit experimental field.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.439
Further back is the hybrid rice experimental field.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.400
The significance of this land,

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:51.759
we all know in our hearts.

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:54.520
Can't see it, right?

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.159
It's fine if you can't see it.

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:58.680
I'll take you to see it later.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.639
Back to business.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.960
Three years ago,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.120
when I came to Hainan for research,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.520
I discovered a type of

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.120
tree with natural insect-repelling abilities.

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.400
At that time, we

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.039
wore out seven or eight pairs of boots walking.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.960
So, we gave this tree a name.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.879
It's called the Boot Tree.

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:14.800
Boot Tree. Boots.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.680
Over these three years,

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.159
one of my research topics

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.759
has been the papaya tree and Boot Tree's

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:20.759
new hybrid variety.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.719
Right here.

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:24.120
This new variety

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:25.159
not only retains

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.039
the original texture and taste of papaya,

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.080
but also

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.360
solves the common problem in papaya trees:

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:31.479
red spider mites.

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:32.680
As you can see with the naked eye,

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:33.759
the previous trees

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.080
lost their green and turned white.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.879
But now, in our experimental field,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.120
it's a lush green patch.

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.599
Yeah.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.479
For sure.

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.360
It means we calculate the leaf chlorosis area.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.439
No need to touch bugs anymore.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.639
Really.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:47.479
Undergraduates,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.599
third year and above,

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:49.879
and graduate students,

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.599
group up to calculate the leaf chlorosis area.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.800
First and second-year undergraduates,

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:56.479
record the standard plant count.

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:58.759
In all four directions,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.120
check the density of lacewings and ladybugs.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.479
Two people per group.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.319
Calculate independently.

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:04.599
The error in your data

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.879
cannot exceed two percent.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.240
The recording method

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.919
is right here,

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.599
in the materials your senior just handed out.

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:11.599
Take a look, everyone.

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:13.360
Remember,

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.000
lacewings and ladybugs

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.959
are natural enemies of red spider mites.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.199
The population of these predators

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.240
is a very important reference indicator.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.639
So take this seriously.

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:22.079
Okay.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.079
Ask me anytime if you have questions.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.600
Okay.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.199
Okay.

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:24.720
Let's get to work.

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:26.120
Just get it done.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:27.959
Go, go, go.

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:29.160
Let's go, Xiao Yin.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.040
Go, go, go.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.720
Hurry up.

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.920
Fu A Fu

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.920
Look at your performance this quarter.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.040
It's at the bottom.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.040
No, no, no, no.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.120
Th-th-this isn't my fault.

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:42.839
It's... it's the bad market environment.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.319
People's hearts are getting colder.

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:46.480
They aren't willing to trade life energy to others.

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.240
Don't give me excuses here.

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:49.560
Look at those rookies.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.360
They are risking their lives working.

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:52.399
Every single one of them is

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:54.160
working the Earth Era 007 schedule.

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:55.839
Don't think just because you have some experience

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:56.480
that you're something special.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.199
Now we speak with results.

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:59.680
We've adopted a last-place elimination system.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.160
If it's like this again next quarter,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.000
even I won't be able to save you.

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.879
If I get laid off...

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:04.800
what will I do?

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:06.879
I don't want to go pick up trash on an alien planet.

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.360
If only I were like humans

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.959
and had parents to sponge off of.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.680
I want to eat that stir-fried octopus.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.480
The octopus can still jump around in the pot.

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.439
Scallops, scallops! Oysters! Two dozen each.

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:19.959
Freshly caught! They're all alive!

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.759
The grouper here is fresh and cheap.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.839
It's still jumping around alive.

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:27.839
My performance numbers are here.

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:43.319
Dear,

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.240
I was at the seafood market

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:49.360
and suddenly heard your

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.000
summons, pleasant as a brass bell.

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.160
Is a big order coming this time?

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.199
Just one question.

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:56.480
This transaction of yours,

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.079
is there a third-party guarantee?

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:03.199
Mom, hurry up!

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.560
Sweetie,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.519
there are lots of kids over there.

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:06.439
Let's go play together.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.519
Lots of kids.

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:10.439
Life energy!

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.800
I'm coming!

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.519
Dear,

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.319
although I saw many children,

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:22.800
I still heard your summons.

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:24.360
There's an order this time, right?

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.040
Your breach of contract clauses

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.319
can't just target the client.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.120
What if you are the ones who breach the contract?

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:31.000
Tell me what the penalties would be.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.720
Sunbathing my back feels so good.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.639
Our music festival is about to start.

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:50.959
Life energy!

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.040
I'm coming!

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.720
Dear,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.040
I just squeezed into the center of the pool.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.399
Going back and forth like this

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.879
is really tiring.

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:11.560
Can you guarantee your after-sales service?

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:13.560
What if you run off one day,

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.839
or get fired?

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:16.040
Who can I turn to then?

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:17.720
Our alien organizational structure

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.879
is very comprehensive.

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:20.279
It's all written in the contract.

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:21.839
My performance is already at the bottom.

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:23.959
If this keeps up, I'll get fired.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.879
Fine.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.639
You can go for now.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.959
I haven't decided yet.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.079
I'll tell you when I have.

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:33.360
Fang'er,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.360
why did you pick such a big tree?

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.560
Look at the small tree Xixi picked.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.959
She'll be done counting in no time.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.759
This one is so big,

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.600
how long will it take to count?

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.839
No rush, Xiao Yin.

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:47.480
Let's count slowly.

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:48.480
Let's have some patience.

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:54.279
Xiao Yin,

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.800
Professor Wang asked us

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.680
to count from all four directions: north, south, east, and west.

00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:58.879
You've been standing on the south side the whole time.

00:07:58.879 --> 00:07:59.839
Your data won't be accurate.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.639
Yeah,

00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:04.360
this is so hard for me.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.079
This hybrid tree species,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.480
its biggest breakthrough

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.920
is its insect resistance.

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:10.120
We need to look at the control source,

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.360
the number of red spiders under the same conditions.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.399
Counting natural predators is also a control variable.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.519
That's the only way to compare the new species' effectiveness.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:17.639
I heard

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:19.319
that the lab results this time,

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:20.439
and the data, are very good.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.319
Basically, without intervention,

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:23.519
red spiders per hundred leaves

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:24.319
are fewer than fifty.

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:25.199
It doesn't affect the fruiting.

00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:29.600
I saw the lab's control data too.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:29.920
But,

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.600
one, fifty, or five hundred,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.639
they're all bugs!

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:33.279
They're all scary!

00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:34.840
I'm just afraid of bugs.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.320
What should I do?

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:39.120
I lost count.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.399
Twenty-five or twenty-six?

00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:41.399
Twenty-seven.

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:43.360
What twenty-seven? It's over thirty already.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.120
You guys are the ones at twenty-seven.

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:46.480
Stop shouting, I counted wrong.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.399
It's messed up over here too.

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:49.080
I was just about to finish counting.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.000
What's the noise about now?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.840
Now I have to start over.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.879
Keep it down, I lost count.

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:55.759
I can't hear.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.360
You guys, keep it down.

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:00.559
Can you stop making noise?

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.879
Alright, alright, stop arguing.

00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:12.080
Just calculate it again.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.840
Hurry up, hurry up, again.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.240
Recalculate.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.679
Calculate it again.

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:16.320
Hurry up, hurry up.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.200
Fang'er.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.440
You really are the chosen agronomist.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.639
I'm not eating, I'm not eating.

00:09:27.639 --> 00:09:28.600
Eat it. It's fresh. It's so sweet.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.200
I won't eat it.

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:29.919
Have a bite.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.120
These past few days,

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.039
I've been thinking,

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.120
what will my mom do if I'm gone?

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.879
I have to find someone she can rely on.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.360
Ruirui, tell me,

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.480
after I'm gone,

00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:46.360
I want Li Wai to be my stand-in.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.600
How about he becomes my mom's son?

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:49.799
That way she'll have some emotional support.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.639
Do you think your mom is stupid,

00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:52.600
or that Li Wai is stupid?

00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:54.320
I'm stupid.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.399
I'm the stupid one.

00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:02.120
I just feel like

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.000
I can still fight for something for you.

00:10:09.039 --> 00:10:09.440
Forget it.

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:10.639
I don't have any hope left.

00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:11.440
Accept fate.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.679
Eat something first.

00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:15.200
It's really super sweet. It's so good.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.879
No, no.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.679
I've gained weight again.

00:10:27.799 --> 00:10:28.440
I no longer

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:30.039
believe you're here to place an order.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.120
Humans are all big liars.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.559
Our A Fu has grown up.

00:10:35.039 --> 00:10:35.320
Come here.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.240
Take a look.

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:38.759
What does this clause in the contract say?

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.639
Six. If a dispute arises between both parties,

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.720
and cannot be resolved through negotiation,

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.639
either party has the right to choose litigation.

00:10:45.639 --> 00:10:46.480
The trader may file a lawsuit to

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.080
the Lifespan Agent's superior agency.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.320
But this clause below also says,

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.799
during the litigation period,

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.080
the Lifespan Agent

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.360
does not have the authority to trade lifespan.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.399
Which means, before the lawsuit results come out,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.039
your performance will be zero.

00:11:11.639 --> 00:11:12.639
Humans aren't liars.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:13.559
Sis.

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:14.840
You are my sister forever.

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:15.919
I... I was wrong.

00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:16.639
I was wrong. I was wrong.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.759
I'll do whatever you want.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.679
Then give his lifespan back.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.120
It's not that I won't exchange it.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.919
After the transaction, it really

00:11:28.919 --> 00:11:30.320
cannot be returned.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.440
I swear on my home planet.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:34.720
I swear.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.639
Put your hand down.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.320
Then we can't let the profiteer have it easy.

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:50.320
Torment him to death.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.000
Why don't you two just say it out loud?

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:54.679
I can already hear it through your expressions.

00:11:55.159 --> 00:11:56.200
We won't make it easy for you.

00:11:56.559 --> 00:11:57.159
Get ready for

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:57.720
internal friction,

00:11:57.879 --> 00:11:58.360
anxiety,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.200
and sleepless nights.

00:12:01.759 --> 00:12:02.120
Let's go.

00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:05.240
Let's go.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.799
You know, this door of theirs...

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:17.720
It's convenient, sure.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.759
But it's also inconvenient.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.279
What if there's no door?

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:23.720
Let's find a chance to try.

00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:28.919
The students are over there.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:29.879
It's fine, I'll get to work.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.799
Okay, okay. Thank you.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.200
What are you doing?

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:33.639
What's wrong?

00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:34.639
They're in class.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.080
Don't disturb them.

00:12:36.679 --> 00:12:37.399
Xiao Yin!

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:39.159
Mom is here!

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:40.679
Mom, Dad.

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:41.399
Dad is here!

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:42.679
Quiet down.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.440
Hello, Uncle and Auntie.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.919
Hello, Uncle and Auntie.

00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:47.200
Keep busy.

00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:51.679
You know, this child...

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.519
She's been in school for a semester now.

00:12:54.919 --> 00:12:56.159
Can she handle things?

00:12:57.039 --> 00:12:58.440
What's the rush?

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:00.960
You're the one who signed her up for agriculture.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.240
She's only a freshman.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.840
And you're the one expecting her to succeed already.

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:05.480
Just look at our health.

00:13:06.039 --> 00:13:07.440
Working another eight or ten years...

00:13:12.399 --> 00:13:13.000
Working another...

00:13:13.679 --> 00:13:14.639
five or six years won't be a problem.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.039
Why are you in such a rush for our daughter to take over?

00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:20.799
It's not about being in a rush.

00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:23.360
You know how fierce competition is in society these days.

00:13:23.799 --> 00:13:24.600
That orchard of ours...

00:13:24.799 --> 00:13:26.120
it's not huge, but it's not small either.

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:27.799
I'm just thinking...

00:13:28.039 --> 00:13:29.399
shouldn't we secure a safety net for her life?

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.039
Xiao Yin!

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.120
Do your best!

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:33.320
Got it!

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.679
Don't hold Gui Fang back.

00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:35.679
Right.

00:13:36.039 --> 00:13:37.039
Stop shouting.

00:13:37.159 --> 00:13:38.039
What do you mean "right"?

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.159
They are in class.

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:41.080
Mom is leaving now.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:41.960
Bye-bye.

00:13:42.679 --> 00:13:43.360
Bye-bye, Mom.

00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:44.159
Bye-bye, Xiao Yin.

00:13:44.159 --> 00:13:45.440
Goodbye, Uncle and Auntie.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.200
Dad is leaving.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.759
Stop shouting. Have some manners.

00:13:47.759 --> 00:13:48.600
You... You're the one shouting.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.600
Bye-bye, kids.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.360
Bye-bye.

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:53.519
How are you guys doing?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.159
Almost done, Senior.

00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:56.200
Keep it up!

00:13:56.559 --> 00:13:57.440
Can you speed it up a bit?

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:57.799
Okay.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:01.759
Xiao Yin, it's okay.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.679
This little bug won't eat you.

00:14:03.679 --> 00:14:04.240
I'll help you.

00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:06.200
It's okay, Fang'er. You go do your work.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.320
I can do this.

00:14:07.759 --> 00:14:09.240
Can't always rely on my bestie to carry me.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.399
Come on.

00:14:11.159 --> 00:14:11.720
I can do this.

00:14:11.879 --> 00:14:12.320
I can do it.

00:14:23.399 --> 00:14:23.919
Oh my gosh.

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:27.559
Fang'er.

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:08.639
I caught it, Fang'er!

00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:09.480
I caught it! Look!

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.799
Xiao Yin, you're amazing.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.919
You're not afraid of bugs anymore.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.080
W-What... How...

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.120
Put it in this box.

00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:16.279
Cover it, cover it.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.360
Like this.

00:15:17.799 --> 00:15:18.519
Great job.

00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:19.639
How about this, Xiao Yin.

00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:21.519
Xiao Yin, you be in charge of catching these bugs.

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:22.559
And I'll be in charge of counting.

00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:24.120
That way we can be more efficient and faster.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:24.519
Okay.

00:15:24.919 --> 00:15:25.320
Let's do this.

00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:26.360
Let's do this.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.159
There's another one here. Here's another one.

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:47.519
Students.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.120
Students.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.200
How are the stats coming along?

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.639
All done.

00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:53.919
Thanks for your hard work.

00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:55.440
Hurry up and pack up.

00:15:55.679 --> 00:15:57.159
Go back, wash up, and rest.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.000
Tonight, take the data you tallied...

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.120
...and remember to hand it in to me.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:02.960
Okay.

00:16:03.039 --> 00:16:03.960
Hurry, hurry.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:04.879
Let's move.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.080
Let's go.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.799
Finally, Fang'er.

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:10.279
Finally.

00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:11.360
Off work, off work!

00:16:11.559 --> 00:16:13.399
It seems the senior isn't done yet.

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:14.000
Fang'er.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.000
Why don't we go...

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.799
...help the senior out?

00:16:15.919 --> 00:16:16.919
Sure, sure. Sounds good.

00:16:16.919 --> 00:16:17.399
Let's go, let's go.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.799
No, I meant let's go have Qingbuliang.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.679
We'll have it tonight.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:21.879
Senior.

00:16:23.919 --> 00:16:24.840
Fang'er.

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:28.159
We've been here two days.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.200
Bro.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.639
Where are you?

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.480
Who said coming here meant...

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.720
Sunshine, beach, waves, cactus?

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.519
Where's your old captain?

00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:37.159
Where did you run off to?

00:16:37.159 --> 00:16:37.960
Haven't seen you at all.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.919
Buddy, I know you can't live without me.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.480
But we don't need to be stuck together every day.

00:16:41.799 --> 00:16:43.080
You two lovebirds have fun.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.480
I won't be the third wheel, okay?

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.679
But let me tell you.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.039
I found that place Xiao Yin mentioned.

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:48.080
The best Qingbuliang.

00:16:48.159 --> 00:16:48.919
I'm already here.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.840
I'm hanging up now.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.440
Young man, hello, hello.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.120
What would you like?

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.320
This one, this one.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:55.919
Forget it, forget it.

00:16:55.919 --> 00:16:57.320
Pack one of everything for me.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.559
Then I'll taste which one is best.

00:16:58.759 --> 00:16:59.320
Okay, okay.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:02.759
Oh my god.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:06.640
Xu Rui, didn't you get bitten?

00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:08.039
There are too many mosquitoes.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.480
Bugs everywhere. I'm done with this place.

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:11.519
There really are a lot of mosquitoes.

00:17:12.039 --> 00:17:13.480
When I went to the bathroom last night...

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.000
...I saw so many cockroaches.

00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:15.759
The biggest one was this big.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:16.880
I saw them too.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.400
Its wings slapped my face so hard it hurt.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.519
That is a bit...

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.799
...of a downside.

00:17:31.359 --> 00:17:32.279
I was looking for a door.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.880
There really doesn't seem to be a door nearby.

00:17:36.119 --> 00:17:36.519
I'm filing a complaint.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.400
Coming, coming.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:38.839
Stop swatting.

00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:39.960
Stop it, stop it.

00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:41.640
You really can only come out of doors, huh?

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.119
Look...

00:17:42.599 --> 00:17:44.119
Couldn't you find a place...

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.799
...closer to a door?

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:47.839
I had to run so far.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.279
Get rid of...

00:17:50.279 --> 00:17:51.599
...all the mosquitoes and bugs here.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.039
What?

00:17:54.519 --> 00:17:55.440
All the mosquitoes and bugs.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.240
Of course, all the mosquitoes and bugs.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.160
No, why should I?

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.559
Don't forget.

00:18:02.119 --> 00:18:04.559
We have a contract dispute right now.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:11.720
Okay.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:12.880
Sister Rui.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.359
I'm on it.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.839
Go, don't waste time.

00:18:15.839 --> 00:18:16.480
Double time!

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.240
Quick, quick, quick.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:17.839
Let's go, let's go.

00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:19.960
Hurry up.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.839
This is so unscientific.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.519
Not a single one.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.279
Do you have any over there?

00:18:38.279 --> 00:18:39.200
No.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.519
How come there isn't a single one?

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.640
This is just too weird.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.519
Why isn't there a single one?

00:18:43.519 --> 00:18:44.200
Check their side.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.160
How is it over there?

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.519
No. Not a single one.

00:18:47.519 --> 00:18:48.599
Same here.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.680
All zeros.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.400
Do you guys have any bugs?

00:18:51.759 --> 00:18:53.039
No.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:53.920
No bugs.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.039
How can there be none at all?

00:18:55.039 --> 00:18:56.400
It doesn't make sense.

00:18:56.519 --> 00:18:58.160
My family grows this traditional variety too.

00:18:58.279 --> 00:18:59.599
Every year at this time,

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.440
if anyone sells pesticide,

00:19:01.519 --> 00:19:02.799
my parents fall for it every time.

00:19:05.279 --> 00:19:06.960
We still have to respect the experiment's conclusion.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.880
Let's just hand it to Professor Wang like this.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.400
I think...

00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:13.440
these bugs...

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:15.160
are here to repay a kindness.

00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:16.559
They want us to finish work early,

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:17.839
go to the night market early, and have fun.

00:19:18.599 --> 00:19:19.200
You're right.

00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:20.720
You're absolutely right.

00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:22.000
I think so too.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.440
That's what they think.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:24.960
Let's go.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.440
Let's go.

00:19:29.359 --> 00:19:30.519
Let's go, Fang'er.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.400
Xu Rui.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.039
This is so blissful.

00:19:41.799 --> 00:19:44.160
I really want to lie here for the rest of my life.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.920
It's not quite perfect.

00:19:54.119 --> 00:19:55.200
There's nothing left to drink.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.079
Wait.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.279
Call him.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.319
Thanks for your hard work.

00:20:01.559 --> 00:20:02.920
Getting more exercise is good.

00:20:03.799 --> 00:20:05.559
You did a good job with the mosquitoes.

00:20:05.559 --> 00:20:06.440
Very happy, huh?

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.000
But, you see, there's a new situation.

00:20:09.799 --> 00:20:10.839
Sister Rui is thirsty.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.759
She wants some of that black...

00:20:12.759 --> 00:20:14.960
...cold, fizzy drink.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.240
And those yellow...

00:20:16.599 --> 00:20:17.960
...slushy, sweet things.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.359
And those drinks with the little popping boba.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.480
Are you talking about...

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.720
...Coke...

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.519
...and mango smoothies?

00:20:25.839 --> 00:20:26.480
Is there a problem?

00:20:26.799 --> 00:20:28.599
You're asking an alien...

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.960
...to go to the store and buy you drinks?

00:20:31.599 --> 00:20:32.200
What time is it now?

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.400
It's contract dispute time.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.599
What happens if I file a complaint?

00:20:34.599 --> 00:20:35.279
All efforts wasted.

00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:35.920
Zero performance record?

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:36.960
The consequences would be unimaginable.

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:38.440
Darn it, darn it, darn it.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.079
An alien...

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.240
...going to the store...

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.640
...to buy you drinks.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.039
No.

00:20:42.039 --> 00:20:43.519
You use life energy...

00:20:43.519 --> 00:20:44.680
...to conjure it up, can't you?

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.160
How can I use life energy?

00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:48.519
I catch mosquitoes and bugs.

00:20:48.759 --> 00:20:50.880
I worked so hard to scrape together that tiny bit of energy.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.240
And I'm supposed to turn it into a drink?

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.559
Energy is the most precious thing.

00:20:53.559 --> 00:20:54.799
Money is the most useless thing.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.519
Then... then just go.

00:20:56.759 --> 00:20:57.599
Good people get rewarded.

00:20:58.799 --> 00:20:59.759
Good person?

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.799
I'm an alien.

00:21:03.039 --> 00:21:04.200
From a higher civilization.

00:21:04.279 --> 00:21:05.319
You're the human.

00:21:05.319 --> 00:21:06.000
You too.

00:21:06.039 --> 00:21:07.480
Your whole family are humans.

00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:16.319
Humans are all big jerks.

00:21:16.319 --> 00:21:17.240
Humans are too terrifying.

00:21:17.599 --> 00:21:19.599
Not innocent like us aliens.

00:21:19.599 --> 00:21:21.079
I should have listened to my boss.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.599
And watched more "Empresses in the Palace"...

00:21:22.599 --> 00:21:23.640
...to sharpen my wits.

00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:27.839
What is this feeling?

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.720
Why is there a...

00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:30.960
...tingly...

00:21:31.279 --> 00:21:32.039
...stifling...

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.799
...feeling like I'm going crazy?

00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:40.279
A human experimental field.

00:21:41.119 --> 00:21:42.799
New life.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.480
The life energy is immense.

00:21:46.319 --> 00:21:47.680
I'm going to drain it all.

00:21:48.799 --> 00:21:51.960
I'm going to drain all their life energy.

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:54.839
Drain it.

00:21:55.079 --> 00:21:55.720
Drain it.

00:21:56.359 --> 00:21:56.880
Drain it.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:57.400
Drain it.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.400
Not a drop left.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.400
Drain it.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:21:59.920
Drain it.

00:22:00.039 --> 00:22:00.480
Drain it.

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:01.319
None shall survive.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.039
I'm going to drain all your energy.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.079
I'm so pissed off.

00:22:05.359 --> 00:22:06.160
Here, and here.

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:08.960
Give me the energy.

00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:10.000
Give me your energy.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:14.960
Drain it all.

00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:15.680
Drain it all.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.480
Drain the energy.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.359
Drain the energy.

00:22:30.759 --> 00:22:32.759
Yesterday's bugs were here to return a favor.

00:22:33.359 --> 00:22:35.039
Today's must be here for revenge.

00:22:36.079 --> 00:22:36.960
From the looks of it...

00:22:38.039 --> 00:22:40.160
Could it have been rooted up by a wild boar?

00:22:41.759 --> 00:22:43.200
I really saw a big fat pig yesterday.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.079
Going crazy in there.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.400
The fruit trees aren't in good shape today.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.200
A massive invasion of lacewings and ladybugs.

00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:52.480
I hope we can finish the count quickly today.

00:22:52.839 --> 00:22:53.400
Let's do this, everyone.

00:22:54.559 --> 00:22:55.640
You can't be serious, Fang'er.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.240
We still have to count this?

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.799
It's absolutely swarming.

00:22:58.799 --> 00:22:59.680
How are we supposed to count?

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.200
Forget it, it's too gross.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.240
Xiao Yin, we have no choice.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.480
Professor Wang assigned this.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.240
It's crawling everywhere.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.079
Just leave it, Fang'er.

00:23:05.079 --> 00:23:07.319
Stop counting. Forget about Professor Wang.

00:23:29.359 --> 00:23:30.519
Everyone,

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:32.440
students,

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.200
I brought you some delicious Qingbuliang.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.000
Quick, come help yourselves.

00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:37.039
Help yourselves, help yourselves.

00:23:38.839 --> 00:23:39.279
Xiao Yin.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.480
I bought this at your favorite shop.

00:23:41.799 --> 00:23:42.200
Taste it.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.920
I'm not in the mood.

00:23:46.079 --> 00:23:47.000
You two are just in time.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:47.519
Godmother, why don't you eat it?

00:23:47.519 --> 00:23:48.839
Come, come, help me count bugs.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:49.759
Yeah.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:50.720
I can't, Godmother.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.640
You can. No excuses. You're a big man.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.119
Don't be afraid.

00:23:53.119 --> 00:23:53.799
Godmother, I'm afraid of bugs.

00:23:53.799 --> 00:23:54.519
I can't, I really can't.

00:23:54.519 --> 00:23:55.039
What are you afraid of?

00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:56.079
Xiao Yin isn't afraid. She even dares to catch them.

00:23:56.079 --> 00:23:56.599
No, Godmother.

00:23:56.599 --> 00:23:58.039
My clothes aren't suitable for catching bugs.

00:23:58.039 --> 00:23:58.799
Then I'll give you ten minutes.

00:23:58.799 --> 00:23:59.720
Come back once you've changed.

00:23:59.799 --> 00:24:00.720
Godmother, are you serious?

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.880
I really... I really can't, Godmother.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.119
Li Wai definitely can't be my mom's son.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:06.839
Day one.

00:24:07.319 --> 00:24:10.160
The density of lacewings and ladybugs on hybrid trees is

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.640
10.4 per square meter.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.039
The density on traditional trees is

00:24:14.039 --> 00:24:15.319
10.2 per square meter.

00:24:15.319 --> 00:24:15.960
Basically the same.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.519
Day two.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.279
Hybrid trees, zero per square meter.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.880
Traditional trees, also zero per square meter.

00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:25.079
Day three.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.519
The density of lacewings and ladybugs on hybrid trees is

00:24:27.519 --> 00:24:28.799
58.6 per square meter.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.200
On traditional trees, it is

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.279
59.3 per square meter.

00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:41.359
Agronomy doesn't exist anymore.

00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:43.119
Professor Wang.

00:24:43.519 --> 00:24:44.000
Do you think

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.720
why is this happening?

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.240
I don't know either.

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.920
This has never happened before.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.119
This data isn't scientific either.

00:24:50.119 --> 00:24:51.160
Not scientific at all.

00:24:51.599 --> 00:24:53.240
Professor Wang, don't worry yet.

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:54.039
How about

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.559
we measure again tomorrow?

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.920
Is the Feng Shui bad here?

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.319
Maybe we should try a different spot tomorrow.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:03.839
Professor Wang.

00:25:04.119 --> 00:25:04.920
Don't be sad.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.200
We free laborers are on call anytime.

00:25:07.319 --> 00:25:07.720
Right, yes.

00:25:08.119 --> 00:25:08.839
Anytime works.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.160
Why are you all so calm?

00:25:12.759 --> 00:25:13.880
Not worried about credits?

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:15.480
Not worried about grade points?

00:25:15.799 --> 00:25:17.039
Not worried about grades?

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.279
Professor.

00:25:19.839 --> 00:25:20.680
We're used to it.

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:21.960
We've been grinding since we were kids.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.160
This is nothing.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.160
Exactly.

00:25:31.039 --> 00:25:31.920
I'm sorry, students.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.559
Just now I

00:25:33.559 --> 00:25:34.519
was a bit too anxious.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.759
For the discipline of agronomy,

00:25:37.759 --> 00:25:38.720
things like this

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.200
are common.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.039
Failed experiments,

00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:44.039
fluctuating moods,

00:25:44.039 --> 00:25:46.200
calm repetition is the daily life of agronomy.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.400
Breakthroughs,

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.079
results,

00:25:48.079 --> 00:25:50.079
these are very rare things.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.920
Although you are only freshmen,

00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:53.480
as your teacher,

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.640
I still have to remind you.

00:25:56.519 --> 00:25:57.319
If

00:25:58.279 --> 00:25:59.720
you can't endure this kind of life,

00:26:00.079 --> 00:26:01.039
you can consider

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:03.240
whether to continue in this discipline.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.319
I will also

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.839
discuss it with other teachers later.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.319
Since you're in Hainan,

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.319
don't miss out on the beautiful scenery.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:16.279
Tomorrow,

00:26:16.759 --> 00:26:17.160
the day after tomorrow,

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:18.839
everyone take a good rest.

00:26:19.319 --> 00:26:19.720
Go have fun.

00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:20.759
Okay?

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:21.720
Go have fun.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.960
Great!

00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:26.920
Qingbuliang, Qingbuliang!

00:26:27.119 --> 00:26:28.000
Let's go to the beach!

00:26:39.519 --> 00:26:40.240
Ocean!

00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:41.759
I'm here!

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.599
His state...

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.240
It's been a few days.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:48.680
Three days.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.160
Ocean!

00:26:50.279 --> 00:26:51.400
I'm here!

00:26:51.519 --> 00:26:52.400
Ocean!

00:26:52.519 --> 00:26:53.759
I'm here!

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.599
Ocean!

00:26:54.599 --> 00:26:55.119
I...

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.079
I'm here!

00:26:58.079 --> 00:26:59.720
I originally said that after leaving,

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.240
if the precious son couldn't be found,

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.640
I might as well find a partner for my mom.

00:27:03.119 --> 00:27:04.359
But now that I think about it,

00:27:04.599 --> 00:27:05.400
forget it.

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:07.799
The kid looks pitiful.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.920
Never been to the seaside before.

00:27:09.839 --> 00:27:11.720
Like the Monkey King when he first saw the sea.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:14.920
My mom is quite something too.

00:27:15.319 --> 00:27:16.319
Finally came to the seaside,

00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:18.400
and went straight to a deserted spot.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.039
Hugging a laptop checking data there.

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:24.000
Really wasted this beautiful vacation.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:40.599
Children!

00:27:41.119 --> 00:27:41.960
Brought you some fruit.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:42.519
Uncle, Auntie.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.680
Freshly picked jackfruit.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.720
Thank you, Uncle, Auntie.

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:45.799
Children!

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.599
Come eat fruit! Come eat fruit!

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:48.240
Auntie.

00:27:48.359 --> 00:27:48.720
This child.

00:27:48.799 --> 00:27:49.680
How come you guys are here?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.880
Sweating all over, soaking wet.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.079
In your room,

00:27:53.079 --> 00:27:54.119
is anything missing?

00:27:54.119 --> 00:27:55.119
Tell Uncle and Auntie right away.

00:27:55.119 --> 00:27:55.839
Everything is great.

00:27:55.839 --> 00:27:56.880
It's all good. Not missing anything.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.240
How about this,

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.519
Auntie will check what's missing.

00:27:58.519 --> 00:27:59.519
Like tissues,

00:27:59.519 --> 00:28:00.960
and dried fruits, I'll bring you some later.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.359
Right, I'm going to play.

00:28:02.359 --> 00:28:03.440
And think about what to eat tonight.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:03.799
Xiao Yin.

00:28:03.799 --> 00:28:05.160
Ask everyone what they want to eat tonight.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.119
Uncle and Auntie will cook for you.

00:28:06.119 --> 00:28:07.160
That's too much trouble for you.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:07.960
No trouble.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.079
Just treat this like your own home.

00:28:09.079 --> 00:28:10.039
Please don't stand on ceremony.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:10.880
Watch out for safety.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.440
Don't go too deep.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.039
Eat up, this fruit is fresh.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.039
So hospitable.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.160
Uncle and Auntie are so nice.

00:28:15.319 --> 00:28:16.119
Coming to Sanya,

00:28:16.279 --> 00:28:17.319
feels like being in the Northeast.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.599
What are you looking at?

00:28:23.079 --> 00:28:24.000
I wasn't looking at anything.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.680
You've been sneaking photos of me for a while.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:27.960
I spotted you ages ago.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.000
I... I just...

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.839
saw you guys playing happily over there just now.

00:28:32.839 --> 00:28:34.039
So I just took a couple of shots.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.319
Hand it over, let me see.

00:28:40.839 --> 00:28:41.799
I recently

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.039
am learning photography from a blogger.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.720
He told me,

00:28:45.839 --> 00:28:48.160
guys who can't take photos can't find girlfriends.

00:28:50.559 --> 00:28:51.119
Stay single then.

00:28:54.279 --> 00:28:54.759
What's wrong?

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.240
This looks... looks pretty good.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:58.920
The scenery is beautiful.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.400
The person is even more beautiful.

00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:28.559
Wei Mingtian.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.599
Finally found you.

00:29:32.079 --> 00:29:33.480
You really made me look hard these past few days.

00:29:33.759 --> 00:29:34.960
You run way too fast.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.319
You are...

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.559
I am...

00:29:38.319 --> 00:29:40.039
I have already proposed termination to Zhang Mai.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.079
Please,

00:29:41.359 --> 00:29:42.839
don't send people to negotiate with me anymore.

00:29:45.319 --> 00:29:47.000
Well, if you want to terminate the contract,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.759
I recommend you find a good lawyer.

00:29:49.079 --> 00:29:50.839
After all, the amount in your contract isn't small.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.200
My name is Sun Keyan.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.519
From your hometown.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.880
I'm the Chief of the Publicity Section at the Provincial Tourism Bureau.

00:30:00.759 --> 00:30:02.119
If you don't believe me, you can check online.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.400
Section Chief?

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:04.720
Then you...

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.880
how come you are here?

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.200
To find you, of course.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.079
Find me?

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.079
Uncle

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:20.720
Where is Wei Mingtian?

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.920
Secretary Sun, what brings you here?

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.599
Where is Wei Mingtian?

00:30:23.079 --> 00:30:23.799
He just left.

00:30:23.799 --> 00:30:25.240
Did you not see his car?

00:30:36.039 --> 00:30:36.720
I'm a step too late.

00:30:37.759 --> 00:30:38.240
As for me,

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.440
I also walked out of Huangyanshan step by step.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.079
Studying,

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.359
and then repaying my hometown.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.799
I want to invite you back

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.839
to be our Tourism Promotion Ambassador.

00:30:47.119 --> 00:30:48.559
The money might not be that much,

00:30:48.759 --> 00:30:50.359
but you can drive the development of our hometown.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:51.880
At the same time,

00:30:52.319 --> 00:30:53.640
I will help you find a legal consultant

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.319
to move forward with the contract termination.

00:30:55.559 --> 00:30:57.359
Even if you want to continue your studies,

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.079
that's no problem.

00:30:58.839 --> 00:31:00.279
And I will work on convincing your parents.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:01.960
You mean

00:31:02.559 --> 00:31:03.680
I can represent my hometown?

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.759
Is my ability enough?

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.839
You have to reach for it to see if you're enough.

00:31:08.119 --> 00:31:08.640
Besides,

00:31:08.799 --> 00:31:09.880
you're even less skilled at being a star,

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.200
but haven't you persisted until now?

00:31:12.119 --> 00:31:12.640
Although

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.920
I think the best timing has already passed,

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:15.920
but

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.079
it shouldn't be too late.

00:31:18.519 --> 00:31:18.839
How about this,

00:31:19.559 --> 00:31:20.279
this is my business card.

00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:21.720
Think about it first.

00:31:22.039 --> 00:31:22.920
If you have any questions,

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.039
contact me anytime.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.319
Okay?

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:26.680
Then you get back to what you were doing.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:27.759
I'll be going then.

00:31:28.119 --> 00:31:28.400
I'm off.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.000
Goodbye, Chief.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:29.559
Bye-bye.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:42.680
Guifang.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.279
What's wrong?

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.880
You look like you have something on your mind.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.000
This data is just very strange.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.880
The more I think about it, the more I feel there's a problem.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:07.680
What's wrong with you?

00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:09.119
You look like

00:32:09.319 --> 00:32:10.119
you have something on your mind too.

00:32:10.599 --> 00:32:11.079
I...

00:32:14.039 --> 00:32:14.559
I'm fine.

00:32:15.279 --> 00:32:16.039
I just...

00:32:16.839 --> 00:32:17.440
got tired from running.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.519
Tired from running.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.400
Then shouldn't you go easy on me?

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.480
Who's going easy on you?

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.039
Tian'er.

00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:25.000
I'm not running anymore.

00:32:26.319 --> 00:32:27.119
You reminded me.

00:32:27.359 --> 00:32:28.319
I should run two more laps.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.240
Still running?

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.880
Chat with my mom some more.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:32.480
It's okay, it's okay.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.000
Young people really have vitality.

00:32:35.039 --> 00:32:35.720
Guifang.

00:32:36.359 --> 00:32:37.359
You're already in Hainan.

00:32:37.359 --> 00:32:38.640
Why don't you go play by the seaside?

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.839
I want to too.

00:32:40.039 --> 00:32:42.000
But it feels like something is weighing on my heart.

00:32:42.119 --> 00:32:43.079
Everyone comes out to play,

00:32:43.079 --> 00:32:43.960
but you... well...

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.880
My body is at the seaside,

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.960
but my heart is in the fields.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.079
You said the first day was normal.

00:32:49.359 --> 00:32:50.640
But things got weird on the second day.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:51.960
There wasn't a single bug.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.720
Then on the third day, it went crazy.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.680
Bugs were flying everywhere.

00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:55.640
Bugs.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.319
Is it possible someone lured them here?

00:32:58.559 --> 00:32:59.720
You know, on the second day...

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.720
Wasn't that the day I asked A Fu to kill the bugs?

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:05.920
On the third day...

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.160
A Fu looked so anxious.

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:10.079
Sabotaging someone's test field...

00:33:10.079 --> 00:33:11.240
It's not impossible.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.759
How could he destroy someone's research?

00:33:15.799 --> 00:33:16.359
Wait a minute.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.079
It seems I'm the one to blame for all this.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:19.960
I'm done for.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:20.680
Auntie.

00:33:21.359 --> 00:33:21.960
You must be tired.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:22.759
Let me help you.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.680
Let me massage your shoulders.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.680
I... I'm not tired. I'm not tired.

00:33:24.799 --> 00:33:25.680
Then have some water.

00:33:25.799 --> 00:33:26.440
You must be hungry.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.240
I... I'll go order you some food.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.519
I'm not hungry.

00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:33.839
How wonderful.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.400
So diligent and sensible.

00:33:39.839 --> 00:33:42.000
You... you just keep researching.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.319
Buddy.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.759
Help me salvage this.

00:33:49.319 --> 00:33:50.240
Fix it up nicely.

00:33:53.319 --> 00:33:53.880
Oh my god.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.280
Xiao Yin's gonna kill me if she sees this.

00:34:15.079 --> 00:34:16.400
Are you crazy, Kong Xiaocan?

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.400
Dad, Mom.

00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:22.480
What are you doing here?

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.559
My dear daughter.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:24.960
Why is your room such a mess?

00:34:25.119 --> 00:34:26.440
It looks like a boys' dorm.

00:34:26.559 --> 00:34:27.440
Dad, stop cleaning.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.440
I can clean it myself.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.239
Let me do it.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.480
I've got it, I've got it. It's fine.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.400
Here, let me.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.800
You're not studying properly at school again, are you?

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Messing around with this sewing nonsense all day.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.519
What are you doing? You want to be a tailor?

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:47.719
I just...

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.719
What's wrong with it?

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.480
Can't you just leave me alone?

00:34:50.559 --> 00:34:52.039
If I don't, you'll turn the house upside down.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.000
I'm worried this will get in the way of your studies.

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:56.440
I... I haven't let it affect my studies.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.679
You haven't let it affect your studies?

00:34:57.679 --> 00:34:58.800
You don't feel it right now.

00:34:59.079 --> 00:35:00.199
But when your grades drop later on,

00:35:00.199 --> 00:35:01.199
you'll be the one crying.

00:35:01.519 --> 00:35:03.039
No, Mom, what are you doing?

00:35:03.039 --> 00:35:04.679
I just like doing this stuff.

00:35:04.679 --> 00:35:05.280
You like it?

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:05.519
Yes.

00:35:05.639 --> 00:35:07.159
You like everything except studying.

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:09.199
If you keep messing with this junk,

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.639
I'll throw it all out the window.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.480
What gives you the right to throw my stuff?

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.320
This is my own stuff.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.159
Why can't I throw it?

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:14.840
Shut up.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.360
Xiao Yin.

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:21.119
Hello, Auntie. Hello, Uncle.

00:35:21.199 --> 00:35:21.639
You're here.

00:35:22.159 --> 00:35:22.880
Look at this photo.

00:35:23.119 --> 00:35:24.039
How is it? Do you like it?

00:35:24.679 --> 00:35:25.360
I don't like it.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.239
It's useless even if you like it.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.280
Am I being too nice to you?

00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:31.039
Don't, don't, don't. Don't be so angry.

00:35:32.519 --> 00:35:33.079
What's wrong, Uncle?

00:35:33.239 --> 00:35:34.360
I'm not talking to you, Li Wai.

00:35:34.519 --> 00:35:35.519
It's between the two of them.

00:35:38.519 --> 00:35:38.960
Turn around.

00:35:42.679 --> 00:35:43.239
Chen Xiaoyin.

00:35:43.519 --> 00:35:44.079
Your classmate is here.

00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:45.119
I'm giving you some face today.

00:35:46.239 --> 00:35:47.400
If you just behave yourself,

00:35:47.639 --> 00:35:48.480
get good grades,

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.800
and find a good job later,

00:35:50.519 --> 00:35:51.519
would Mom bother you about this?

00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:53.400
Then you can pedal that sewing machine until it takes off.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.119
Mom won't say a word.

00:35:54.599 --> 00:35:55.960
You can even make a nice outfit for Mom.

00:35:56.599 --> 00:35:57.000
Right?

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:58.880
But right now,

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.679
your main priority is studying.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.360
Put your hobbies on the back burner for now.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:04.320
Right.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:05.599
Auntie.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.480
You're right.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.039
Listen to your classmate's advice.

00:36:08.119 --> 00:36:08.800
But only half right.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.639
Studying,

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.440
is certainly important,

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.719
but I think,

00:36:13.159 --> 00:36:14.519
at our age right now,

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.039
having a hobby that

00:36:16.039 --> 00:36:17.159
we truly love is more important.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.199
Uncle, have some water.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.239
I think,

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.760
while we're young,

00:36:23.079 --> 00:36:24.159
we should try out more of

00:36:24.159 --> 00:36:25.559
the things we truly love.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.360
If we wait until we're your and Uncle's age,

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.880
it might be too late to try.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:29.559
Drink a little less.

00:36:30.599 --> 00:36:31.920
The clothes Xiao Yin made,

00:36:32.039 --> 00:36:32.559
I've seen them.

00:36:32.719 --> 00:36:34.199
although there's still room for improvement, kid,

00:36:34.199 --> 00:36:35.519
they're already very nice.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.199
Look at your uncle coughing like that.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.360
Go buy him some medicine.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.360
Auntie.

00:36:43.159 --> 00:36:43.400
Medicine.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.039
You're getting older.

00:36:44.039 --> 00:36:44.719
You've been through this too.

00:36:44.719 --> 00:36:45.679
You surely understand what I'm saying.

00:36:45.679 --> 00:36:46.039
Medicine.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.039
Buy me some medicine.

00:36:47.199 --> 00:36:47.639
Just something to soothe the throat.

00:36:47.639 --> 00:36:48.880
Okay, okay, right away.

00:36:50.519 --> 00:36:51.239
This child.

00:36:52.199 --> 00:36:52.840
Calm down.

00:36:53.119 --> 00:36:53.960
You shut up. It's no big deal.

00:36:54.679 --> 00:36:55.039
Turn back around.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.239
Fine.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.199
You're all on the same side.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.440
You're all right, and I'm the only one wrong, huh?

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:09.840
Chen Xiaoyin

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.280
You can do it

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.239
But

00:37:16.519 --> 00:37:18.079
if this affects your grades

00:37:19.079 --> 00:37:20.800
I'll beat both you and your dad then

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:25.800
All right, all right

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.079
It's over, it's over

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.079
Hurry up and thank Mom

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.440
Thanks, Mom

00:37:29.639 --> 00:37:30.639
Don't... don't give me that nonsense

00:37:31.679 --> 00:37:33.880
I think what that kid Li Wai said

00:37:34.199 --> 00:37:34.960
was pretty right

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.519
It's a bit like my wisdom

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:37.280
Yeah

00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:38.400
Just as dim-witted

00:37:39.719 --> 00:37:40.519
Your mom is funny

00:37:40.599 --> 00:37:41.320
Get out of here

00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:42.880
Go get some fruit for the kid

00:37:43.079 --> 00:37:43.559
You got it

00:37:44.599 --> 00:37:45.000
Just wait

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.639
Don't hold me

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.719
Didn't you say I was old?

00:37:48.719 --> 00:37:49.280
I can walk by myself

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.320
Where do you look old?

00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:10.519
Li Wai

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.639
Send me those photos

00:38:12.639 --> 00:38:13.440
you secretly took of me just now.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.599
I did it, okay?

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:20.880
It was all me.

00:38:21.039 --> 00:38:21.800
Please.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.440
First of all,

00:38:22.679 --> 00:38:24.480
I am a higher civilization.

00:38:24.719 --> 00:38:25.280
Secondly,

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.480
I am a higher civilization.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.199
Look at how tortured I am now.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.639
I can't even speak clearly anymore.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.400
I'm telling you,

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.360
if I get optimized,

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.519
it won't end well for you guys.

00:38:34.119 --> 00:38:35.239
You should have been optimized ages ago.

00:38:37.159 --> 00:38:38.239
It feels so awful.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.000
I just feel like...

00:38:39.199 --> 00:38:40.039
my eyes...

00:38:40.199 --> 00:38:41.639
keep wanting to leak water.

00:38:41.639 --> 00:38:42.519
Alright, stop being sad.

00:38:42.519 --> 00:38:43.159
Crying is useless.

00:38:43.159 --> 00:38:44.320
Crying won't make her soft-hearted anyway.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:45.840
I...

00:38:46.199 --> 00:38:48.519
My chest, from last night until now,

00:38:48.679 --> 00:38:50.199
has been hurting constantly.

00:38:50.639 --> 00:38:51.199
Are you sure

00:38:51.199 --> 00:38:52.960
you still want to stay with this woman?

00:38:53.559 --> 00:38:54.679
I've set my heart on her for this lifetime.

00:38:54.679 --> 00:38:55.239
So what?

00:38:56.559 --> 00:38:57.000
Humans...

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.440
are so complex.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.679
Why?

00:39:01.679 --> 00:39:02.920
I don't want to.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.480
Alright, alright, alright.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.199
Stop crying.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.519
I promise you,

00:39:08.239 --> 00:39:08.599
from now on,

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:09.760
I won't torture you anymore.

00:39:10.039 --> 00:39:10.639
You swear.

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:11.840
I swear.

00:39:13.159 --> 00:39:13.599
However,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.280
in the future, create your own performance stats.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.159
Don't ruin others' experimental results anymore.

00:39:18.159 --> 00:39:18.719
Do you hear me?

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.800
Okay, I promise.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.360
Swear.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.480
I swear.

00:39:23.159 --> 00:39:23.519
Let's go.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.400
I have a good idea.

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:31.440
It's like this.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.800
Many of my peers,

00:39:34.199 --> 00:39:35.360
do business like this.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:35.920
They...

00:39:36.039 --> 00:39:38.159
find a helper on another planet.

00:39:38.239 --> 00:39:40.079
That is, a temporary Lifespan Agent.

00:39:40.079 --> 00:39:41.039
To help them complete their performance quotas.

00:39:41.199 --> 00:39:42.639
I want to align granularity with them.

00:39:44.039 --> 00:39:44.599
Ms. Lin,

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.079
would you be willing to be my

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.679
temporary Lifespan Agent?

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.239
No way.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.320
Don't get any funny ideas, hear me?

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:56.480
Lose some weight,

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.880
Higher Civilization.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.639
Count me in, count me in.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.159
Okay.

00:40:07.159 --> 00:40:07.760
Come, come, come.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.119
I'll just stand on the side.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:09.840
Okay.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:10.920
Let's take photos with the sea.

00:40:11.079 --> 00:40:12.199
The sunset is just right.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.079
You've got sand all over you.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.599
Three, two, one.

00:40:15.599 --> 00:40:16.199
So beautiful.

00:40:16.199 --> 00:40:17.280
Xiao Yin is so beautiful.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.119
You guys take photos first.

00:40:19.079 --> 00:40:19.599
Guifang.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.039
What are you doing? Sit here.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:22.760
Let's go.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.840
Hang out with everyone, take some photos.

00:40:25.119 --> 00:40:25.800
It looks so good.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.760
It looks good even without a beauty filter.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.519
I just feel that...

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.199
I don't want to let this matter go just like this.

00:40:42.559 --> 00:40:43.599
Who said forget it?

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.440
Who said forget it?

00:40:47.639 --> 00:40:49.320
But I saw you all playing over there.

00:40:52.239 --> 00:40:53.239
What else could we do?

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.400
We don't have any ideas right now anyway.

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:57.079
Might as well let everyone have some fun.

00:40:57.079 --> 00:40:57.880
Relax a bit.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:58.960
Reset our mindset.

00:40:59.199 --> 00:41:00.519
Maybe once we're refreshed...

00:41:00.519 --> 00:41:02.039
...the ideas will just pop up.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.519
Haste makes waste.

00:41:05.679 --> 00:41:06.159
Get it?

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.199
Let's go.

00:41:09.679 --> 00:41:10.320
Let's go take photos.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.360
It's so pretty. They took great photos. Come on.

00:41:12.519 --> 00:41:13.519
Come on, come on. Let's take a picture.

00:41:13.519 --> 00:41:14.159
Come on, come on.

00:41:14.199 --> 00:41:14.599
Gui Fang.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.480
Stand in the middle. Stand in the middle. Come on.

00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:17.679
Stand together. Stand together.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.000
One, two, three.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:26.400
Lao Yu.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.119
I brought the kids here this time...

00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:29.039
...mainly for practical experience.

00:41:29.039 --> 00:41:29.840
And to take a look at...

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.320
...our lab's working environment.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:32.280
Sure.

00:41:32.719 --> 00:41:33.679
But after they see it...

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.639
...don't let them get scared away.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:35.639
Our place here...

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.920
...is too tiring and tough.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:37.840
How is that possible?

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.039
The students I mentor...

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:40.639
It's hard to say.

00:41:41.639 --> 00:41:42.440
She's the only one who's okay.

00:41:43.119 --> 00:41:43.920
She's dead set on it.

00:41:44.719 --> 00:41:45.239
Professor Wang.

00:41:46.159 --> 00:41:47.679
How is that project of yours going lately?

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.360
I haven't got a clue.

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:51.880
That's normal.

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.199
What about here in Hainan?

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.519
They are building a new highway.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.440
And they asked us...

00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:56.360
...to participate in the planning.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.760
To not damage the existing ecology.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.519
It's been a few months now.

00:42:00.519 --> 00:42:01.679
And we still haven't found the best solution.

00:42:02.679 --> 00:42:03.440
Worrying won't help.

00:42:03.639 --> 00:42:04.400
It's not that easy.

00:42:05.559 --> 00:42:06.039
Take it slow.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:07.880
Students.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.480
Come look.

00:42:09.639 --> 00:42:11.440
This is the hybrid papaya I developed...

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.000
...in its infancy.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.119
Everyone come and take a look.

00:42:15.719 --> 00:42:17.480
A miniature papaya tree.

00:42:17.639 --> 00:42:18.599
So cute.

00:42:18.599 --> 00:42:19.559
It's too cute.

00:42:19.559 --> 00:42:20.079
Students.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.719
If Professor Wang's project succeeds...

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.880
...all the growers in Hainan...

00:42:25.159 --> 00:42:26.519
...will benefit from it.

00:42:26.639 --> 00:42:27.199
Isn't that awesome?

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.480
Awesome!

00:42:31.639 --> 00:42:32.360
The process...

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.000
...might be bumpy...

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.320
...but the moment you get results...

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:37.920
...all the frustration...

00:42:38.079 --> 00:42:40.119
...grievances, and pain disappear.

00:42:40.599 --> 00:42:41.000
Right.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.719
Breeding a new domestic seed...

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.800
...is far more meaningful than making money.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:50.840
That's right.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.000
That's what agronomy is about.

00:42:54.079 --> 00:42:54.639
Students.

00:42:56.519 --> 00:42:57.679
Shall we do it again?

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.760
Come on.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.360
Let's do it.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.880
Come on, let's try it again.

00:43:02.559 --> 00:43:03.400
Just get it done.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.159
Do it!

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:05.519
Just get it done.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:06.800
Just get it done.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:18.599
I think I know...

00:43:18.599 --> 00:43:20.239
...what my mom's future pillar is.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:10.519
Not bad.

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.239
My girl has my style from back in the day.

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:15.480
I think...

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.320
we can rest easy handing the business

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.800
over to our daughter.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.639
Can't we retire early

00:44:21.639 --> 00:44:22.440
and go traveling?

00:44:24.599 --> 00:44:25.639
Didn't you say just a few days ago

00:44:25.639 --> 00:44:26.880
three, five, ten, or eight years,

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:27.800
you'd be fine with it?

00:44:28.639 --> 00:44:29.320
Besides,

00:44:29.559 --> 00:44:31.039
can you bear to let our girl suffer like that?

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.800
What I mean is,

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.800
Xiao Yin is already capable of standing on her own.

00:44:35.079 --> 00:44:35.840
I'm relieved.

00:44:37.239 --> 00:44:37.920
Actually,

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:39.760
I'm not forcing her to learn

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.079
things she doesn't like.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:42.920
I just want,

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:44.800
while she's in college,

00:44:45.239 --> 00:44:46.800
for her to learn a skill,

00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:47.960
learn some abilities,

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:48.960
so in the future,

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.159
she'll have the ability to stand on her own.

00:44:50.159 --> 00:44:50.800
Yes, yes, yes.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.159
That way, whatever she does later,

00:44:54.039 --> 00:44:54.800
I'll support her.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.159
Go, Xiao Yin!

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.119
Don't talk. The kid is in class.

00:45:00.119 --> 00:45:00.960
What are you doing? No manners.

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:01.599
She's done speaking.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.519
Hello, Uncle. Hello, Auntie.

00:45:41.039 --> 00:45:42.159
Why aren't you working?

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.119
I'm going right now.

00:45:45.119 --> 00:45:45.639
Go, go, go.

00:45:45.639 --> 00:45:46.119
You eat.

00:45:47.119 --> 00:45:47.800
Go, go, go.

00:45:48.199 --> 00:45:48.800
Xiao Yin.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.519
I'm here to help you.

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.239
Oh my god!

00:45:54.159 --> 00:45:54.719
It's okay, it's okay.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.199
Um, what can I help you with?

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:57.960
Just straighten it up.

00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:58.440
This one?

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:00.360
Just straighten it.

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.559
Alright, the meat is ready, friends.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.320
Come on, kids, the seafood is ready too.

00:47:35.239 --> 00:47:36.519
Come, come, let's serve the teacher.

00:47:37.039 --> 00:47:38.119
Thanks, Big Sister. Thanks, Big Sister.

00:47:38.599 --> 00:47:39.400
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

00:47:40.119 --> 00:47:40.639
Kids.

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.280
That's all the dishes served now.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.159
Thanks, Xiao Yin's mom.

00:47:44.159 --> 00:47:44.559
Thanks.

00:47:44.559 --> 00:47:45.119
You're welcome.

00:47:45.239 --> 00:47:45.760
Xiao Yin.

00:47:46.039 --> 00:47:46.599
Where's our dad?

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:48.360
No,

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:49.719
your dad.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:51.840
It's our family tradition.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.039
Men don't sit at the table for New Year's Eve dinner.

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:54.760
Just kidding, just kidding.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.159
My dad's in the kitchen making dumplings.

00:47:56.639 --> 00:47:56.960
Alright.

00:47:57.199 --> 00:47:57.960
Then after today,

00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.320
tomorrow I'll make dumplings with Uncle.

00:48:01.079 --> 00:48:02.400
Xiao Yin.

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:03.440
What's that supposed to mean?

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.719
The kids are just fooling around.

00:48:06.679 --> 00:48:07.280
Um,

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:08.639
I'd like to propose a toast.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.440
Here,

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:11.920
I...

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:15.960
wish the Papaya Tree Project complete success.

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.519
I really want to slap you.

00:48:18.719 --> 00:48:19.559
Okay.

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:20.920
Complete success.

00:48:21.119 --> 00:48:22.760
Cheers.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.239
I hope your words come true.

00:48:24.239 --> 00:48:24.960
For sure, for sure.

00:48:25.239 --> 00:48:26.079
Good, good, good.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:27.760
By the way,

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:28.320
classmates,

00:48:28.559 --> 00:48:30.239
do you have any New Year's wishes?

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:30.920
Tell us.

00:48:31.199 --> 00:48:32.920
New Year's wishes...

00:48:35.039 --> 00:48:35.639
I have one.

00:48:36.519 --> 00:48:40.039
I plan to open an online clothing store with Xixi called

00:48:40.719 --> 00:48:42.039
Xixi Que Yin.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:43.840
Great, I support you.

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:44.840
What?

00:48:49.519 --> 00:48:49.880
Fine.

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:51.760
Don't let it affect your studies.

00:48:53.519 --> 00:48:53.920
Xiao Yin.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Long live Auntie!

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:56.440
Look at her mom.

00:48:57.159 --> 00:48:59.119
What about me? What about me?

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:00.239
I've thought it through.

00:49:00.679 --> 00:49:02.320
At my age and with my results,

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.519
it's time to consider retiring.

00:49:03.639 --> 00:49:05.639
But I still love the sports industry.

00:49:05.639 --> 00:49:06.800
So I plan to move towards

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.800
becoming a coach or a referee.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:13.800
And hope to continue contributing to the sports world.

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.039
Good.

00:49:16.199 --> 00:49:18.480
I plan to have a good talk with Uncle Sun.

00:49:19.039 --> 00:49:20.000
What he wants to do for his hometown,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:20.960
is also what I want to do.

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.519
I'm ready to take this step.

00:49:23.239 --> 00:49:24.960
Who is Uncle Sun?

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.159
I'll tell you all about that later.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:27.719
How about you?

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:28.960
Me?

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:33.039
I haven't decided exactly what I want to do yet.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.559
But those researchers...

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:36.960
are exactly who I want to become.

00:49:37.039 --> 00:49:39.119
That is the life I want to pursue.

00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:40.280
Great.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:40.880
Good.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:41.280
Nice.

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.480
I'll say a serious one.

00:49:43.159 --> 00:49:44.280
This wish is very important.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.719
And I really hope it comes true.

00:49:47.159 --> 00:49:48.400
Her wish is my wish.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.000
Is that loyal enough, Xiao Fang?

00:49:52.599 --> 00:49:53.480
Do your best.

00:49:53.639 --> 00:49:54.880
Then I wish everyone...

00:49:55.159 --> 00:49:55.719
in the New Year,

00:49:56.079 --> 00:49:57.159
may all your dreams come true.

00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:58.159
Cheers.

00:49:58.159 --> 00:50:00.079
Happy New Year.

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.599
These are all centrifuges

00:51:26.719 --> 00:51:28.719
And we must balance them when centrifuging

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:29.800
These two little ears

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:31.480
Make sure to align them with the center

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:32.880
The lid must be screwed on tight

00:51:36.159 --> 00:51:36.519
Guifang

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:38.480
Professor Wang

00:51:38.639 --> 00:51:39.199
Hello, Professor

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.800
I'm going to another company later

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.840
To discuss the new seed procurement

00:51:42.079 --> 00:51:43.000
Over at Wanxiang Denong

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.519
Take the presentation we made last time

00:51:44.599 --> 00:51:45.320
And refine it a bit

00:51:45.599 --> 00:51:46.400
Send it over to Mr. Ma

00:51:46.639 --> 00:51:48.000
Make a simple promotional introduction

00:51:48.119 --> 00:51:48.480
Okay

00:51:48.639 --> 00:51:49.199
As soon as possible

00:51:49.599 --> 00:51:50.400
Then I'll go get it in a bit

00:51:50.519 --> 00:51:51.119
I'm leaving then

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:51.559
Okay

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.920
Kong Guifang

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:35.920
Let's go, buddy

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:36.880
Let's grab a bite at the cafeteria

00:52:37.079 --> 00:52:37.840
I can't

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:38.920
I'm going to get food for my mom

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.239
She's in the lab every day; her stomach can't take it

00:53:11.079 --> 00:53:11.599
Buddy

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:18.079
You almost died

00:53:25.159 --> 00:53:26.519
It's been a peaceful two years

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:29.079
I almost forgot

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:30.719
I

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:33.480
am going to die
