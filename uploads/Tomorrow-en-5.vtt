WEBVTT

00:00:25.914 --> 00:00:27.749
Here’s the lunch box
I borrowed from you.

00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:30.206
Thanks too, Pres.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.127
Sorry.

00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:38.451
I can’t stand being
away from you anymore.

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:40.061
Via, I’m really sorry.

00:00:40.086 --> 00:00:41.295
I’m sorry, please.

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:42.802
It’s fine now.

00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:46.138
Pres is graduating soon.

00:00:46.138 --> 00:00:47.390
When are you going to confess?

00:00:47.807 --> 00:00:49.433
Maybe I don’t have to. Right?

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:50.726
What if

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:52.520
you confess
during the field trip?

00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:04.657
Via’s got something to say.

00:01:04.807 --> 00:01:05.808
Want some churros?

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:08.244
I like you.

00:01:14.038 --> 00:01:15.242
I’m sorry, Via.

00:01:17.763 --> 00:01:19.265
I like someone else.

00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:27.972
I don’t have a crush anymore.

00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:29.939
Forget about not having a crush.

00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:39.590
Just have a crush on me instead,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.217
since I have
a crush on you anyway.

00:01:45.054 --> 00:01:46.264
Look at them.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.183
Wow, they look so crazy.

00:01:49.183 --> 00:01:50.643
They’re so hyper, right?

00:01:51.727 --> 00:01:52.728
Just remember,

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:54.981
we’re always here for you.

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:56.816
Your friends.

00:01:57.191 --> 00:01:58.359
I got you something.

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:59.443
Happy birthday!

00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:02.196
Don’t take it off, okay?

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:03.462
Promise?

00:02:05.047 --> 00:02:06.212
Kino.

00:02:06.284 --> 00:02:08.244
Eat first. Don’t skip your meals.

00:02:08.244 --> 00:02:09.453
Arkin!

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.250
Naya, it feels like I haven’t seen
you in the music club for a while.

00:02:15.376 --> 00:02:17.336
Why? Did you miss me?

00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:40.419
Kino forgot his lunch box again.

00:03:59.855 --> 00:04:00.940
Wait a minute, okay?

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:06.153
Via?

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.488
- Oh!
- Were you looking for me?

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:08.948
Huh?

00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:10.449
Your—

00:04:11.158 --> 00:04:12.827
Here’s your lunch.
You forgot it.

00:04:13.035 --> 00:04:14.036
Okay.

00:04:14.578 --> 00:04:15.788
- Here. You should eat first.
- Thank you.

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.623
I’ll go now. I don’t want
to be a bother.

00:04:18.165 --> 00:04:19.417
A bother? No, not at all.

00:04:19.417 --> 00:04:20.626
Have you eaten yet?
Let’s eat together.

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:22.461
No, it’s fine.
I already ate. I’m full.

00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:24.027
I’m really full. Thanks for asking.

00:04:24.672 --> 00:04:25.673
Arkin!

00:04:25.673 --> 00:04:27.675
Arkin, let’s go back inside.

00:04:30.386 --> 00:04:32.304
Let’s continue what we were doing.

00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:34.807
We’re practicing since we’re
doing a duet for the club fair.

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:36.892
- Go ahead. Bye now.
- Okay.

00:04:37.049 --> 00:04:38.967
Good luck. Take care!

00:04:48.985 --> 00:04:52.073
There’s nothing wrong
if Arkin gets a girlfriend.

00:04:52.118 --> 00:04:54.746
That’s actually good.
It might help him mature.

00:04:54.856 --> 00:04:57.995
But how would that
affect our friendship?

00:05:02.626 --> 00:05:03.627
Hey.

00:05:03.878 --> 00:05:05.671
You’re spacing out?

00:05:07.454 --> 00:05:10.248
Huh? It’s nothing.

00:05:11.098 --> 00:05:12.808
I was just thinking.

00:05:12.887 --> 00:05:14.972
It’s from this movie I watched.

00:05:14.972 --> 00:05:18.142
There was this one scene
that really got me thinking.

00:05:18.142 --> 00:05:19.685
What do you guys think?

00:05:19.685 --> 00:05:23.856
Let’s say, a guy best friend
gets himself a girlfriend.

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:25.858
What happens then?

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:32.281
Will he stop having time
for his girl best friend?

00:05:34.283 --> 00:05:35.284
Of course.

00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:39.305
He’d rather hang out with
his girlfriend than his friend.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.627
Friends will always be around.
While couples break up.

00:05:47.838 --> 00:05:51.800
You know, the girlfriend
might also get jealous,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.113
so he’d probably see his
girl best friend less often.

00:05:57.806 --> 00:05:59.099
I kinda agree.

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.228
But for me, you need
to make time for both.

00:06:02.645 --> 00:06:05.397
You can’t just drop your best friend
because you have a girlfriend.

00:06:06.023 --> 00:06:08.317
They’re both important.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.364
That movie sounds nice.
What’s it called?

00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:16.242
Huh?

00:06:16.825 --> 00:06:17.826
Oh—

00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:23.624
I can’t remember.
I forgot the title.

00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:29.296
I think the title is,
The Life Story of Via and Arkin.

00:06:30.673 --> 00:06:31.924
Just admit it.

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:33.008
Come on.

00:06:33.008 --> 00:06:34.843
It’s just a movie.

00:06:34.843 --> 00:06:36.095
Just a movie, huh?

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:37.137
- Fine then.
- Okay.

00:06:37.137 --> 00:06:38.389
Let’s just study.

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:39.497
Right.

00:06:40.182 --> 00:06:41.475
Sounds very similar.

00:06:47.361 --> 00:06:49.238
- Let’s go, Via!
- Let’s go, Via!

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:50.859
That’s it!

00:06:51.443 --> 00:06:52.486
Oh my god!

00:06:53.612 --> 00:06:54.613
Oh my god!

00:07:01.078 --> 00:07:02.204
Arkin, Arkin.

00:07:02.204 --> 00:07:03.956
- Can we take a picture with you?
- Can we take a picture with you?

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:05.708
Oh my gosh,
you’re so handsome.

00:07:08.627 --> 00:07:10.379
Go, Valeria!

00:07:12.715 --> 00:07:14.008
Shay, set it for me.

00:07:25.561 --> 00:07:26.687
Thank you!

00:07:26.687 --> 00:07:28.147
I’ll take photos of the game now.

00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:06.727
Hey, isn’t that your crush?

00:08:06.727 --> 00:08:08.020
You like that one, right?

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.730
And that one too.

00:08:15.986 --> 00:08:18.030
Oh my lord! Oh dear!

00:08:18.364 --> 00:08:20.949
You’ve been cheating on me
this whole time?

00:08:20.949 --> 00:08:23.118
We’ve been together for so long!

00:08:23.118 --> 00:08:24.745
You bastard!

00:08:36.882 --> 00:08:38.592
Via, we can also do that.

00:08:41.512 --> 00:08:44.473
Wow! Who was that?

00:08:45.099 --> 00:08:46.642
Amazing!

00:08:48.143 --> 00:08:49.144
Via, Via.

00:08:49.144 --> 00:08:50.354
- Via!
- How do you do it?

00:08:52.648 --> 00:08:53.357
Pardon me.

00:08:53.357 --> 00:08:55.109
Excuse me
Excuse me, please.

00:08:55.109 --> 00:08:57.027
- Let’s not be too loud.
- What’s up?

00:08:58.987 --> 00:09:01.115
You know that song
“I’ll Say It Now.” right?

00:09:02.324 --> 00:09:03.325
Yeah. Why?

00:09:03.659 --> 00:09:04.785
Be my duet partner.

00:09:04.785 --> 00:09:06.662
Looks like Naya’s gonna be late.

00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:07.496
Me?

00:09:07.496 --> 00:09:08.497
Yeah.

00:09:09.456 --> 00:09:10.457
Up there on stage?

00:09:11.125 --> 00:09:12.876
Kino, no, I don’t want to.

00:09:13.585 --> 00:09:14.712
Via, please.

00:09:15.587 --> 00:09:16.588
Just this once.

00:09:16.755 --> 00:09:18.966
Kino, you already know why I can’t.

00:09:19.258 --> 00:09:20.259
I don’t want to!

00:09:21.552 --> 00:09:24.430
Okay. I understand.

00:09:25.931 --> 00:09:27.766
I’ll just sing alone then.

00:09:30.227 --> 00:09:31.228
I’ll go ahead.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.021
Kino!

00:09:35.737 --> 00:09:36.738
Fine.

00:09:37.192 --> 00:09:38.444
I’ll go with you.

00:09:38.944 --> 00:09:39.945
Really?

00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:42.072
Yes.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.908
Okay, let’s go.

00:10:00.215 --> 00:10:02.384
What a very impactful
and high-level performance

00:10:02.384 --> 00:10:04.511
from our representative
of the school choir.

00:10:04.787 --> 00:10:08.458
To keep the excitement going,
let’s call on our next performers.

00:10:08.599 --> 00:10:10.476
Let’s welcome
from the Music Club,

00:10:10.642 --> 00:10:13.979
Larkin Sanchez and his vocalist,
Avianna Diaz!

00:10:39.982 --> 00:10:40.982
Go Arkin!

00:10:41.007 --> 00:10:42.007
I love you!

00:10:53.644 --> 00:10:55.354
Via, don’t be nervous.

00:10:55.771 --> 00:10:56.772
You got this.

00:10:57.731 --> 00:10:59.233
Kino, there are so many people.

00:10:59.942 --> 00:11:02.444
Everyone’s watching.
I don’t think I can do this.

00:11:04.738 --> 00:11:06.782
Just keep your eyes on me. Okay?

Absolutely amazing!

00:13:06.902 --> 00:13:08.111
Via, thank you so much.

00:13:08.111 --> 00:13:09.863
You’re a total lifesaver.
Seriously.

00:13:10.155 --> 00:13:12.282
And didn’t I tell you?
Your voice is incredible.

00:13:12.282 --> 00:13:14.826
Didn’t you hear all
the cheering and clapping?

00:13:15.744 --> 00:13:16.745
So, what do you think?

00:13:17.037 --> 00:13:18.242
Let’s do this again next time!

00:13:18.455 --> 00:13:21.124
Next time? There’s no next time.

00:13:21.124 --> 00:13:22.793
I did it because you
didn’t have a duet partner.

00:13:22.793 --> 00:13:24.336
Next time, if you don’t have a partner,

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:25.879
you’re on your own!

00:13:30.759 --> 00:13:32.260
You know how things
went with mom,

00:13:32.886 --> 00:13:36.723
how fame and music
messed her up.

00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:40.852
Yeah, I get it.

00:13:41.812 --> 00:13:42.813
I’m sorry, Via.

00:13:44.731 --> 00:13:47.234
That’s why what you did
for me means so much.

00:13:47.609 --> 00:13:48.625
Thank you.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.991
Tell Naya to not
be late next time, okay?

00:13:53.991 --> 00:13:55.742
She’s got a nice voice.

00:13:56.326 --> 00:13:57.327
But she was late.

00:13:57.327 --> 00:13:58.787
Your voice is better.

00:14:00.998 --> 00:14:03.417
You’re just saying that because
I’m right in front of you.

00:14:03.417 --> 00:14:06.753
Come on, I know Naya’s voice
is better than mine.

00:14:07.337 --> 00:14:09.297
And besides, you two are
pretty close, right?

00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:12.134
Your voice is better,
and what do you mean, close?

00:14:12.134 --> 00:14:13.468
Who said that?

00:14:14.928 --> 00:14:18.473
Didn’t you almost
kiss the other day?

00:14:20.142 --> 00:14:22.019
What are you talking about? When?

00:14:23.103 --> 00:14:26.023
The other day, when I came
to bring you your lunch.

00:14:35.711 --> 00:14:36.758
Wait a minute, okay?

00:14:43.874 --> 00:14:45.917
That looked like we were
about to kiss to you?

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.045
She just wiped something off my face!

00:14:48.045 --> 00:14:49.379
I was even annoyed
when she did it.

00:14:49.379 --> 00:14:50.390
And

00:14:50.756 --> 00:14:52.257
didn’t we agree

00:14:53.008 --> 00:14:54.780
that our first kiss
would be with each other?

00:14:56.803 --> 00:14:58.388
When would that even happen?

00:14:59.473 --> 00:15:00.515
Right now.

00:15:04.644 --> 00:15:05.645
Here.

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:07.851
Ouch!

00:15:09.566 --> 00:15:11.485
That hurt, Via!

00:15:12.027 --> 00:15:13.820
- I’m sorry.
- Why did you do that?

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.238
I thought you wanted a slap.

00:15:15.238 --> 00:15:16.359
I’m sorry.

00:15:18.366 --> 00:15:21.119
I thought I was finally
getting my first kiss.

00:15:21.453 --> 00:15:23.371
You really are
a volleyball player, Via.

00:15:32.881 --> 00:15:34.174
There, you got it.

00:15:34.674 --> 00:15:35.967
Ah, yeah…

00:15:36.085 --> 00:15:38.345
My… my first kiss… on the cheek.

00:15:38.345 --> 00:15:39.351
Right.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.143
I’m gonna go get
some fresh air, Via.

00:15:45.143 --> 00:15:47.062
Huh? Yeah, it’s really hot
in this music room.

00:15:47.062 --> 00:15:48.313
I know. Feels like—

00:15:50.148 --> 00:15:50.941
Are you oka—

00:15:50.941 --> 00:15:51.691
Kino?

00:15:51.691 --> 00:15:52.734
I’m okay.

00:15:58.544 --> 00:16:00.444
Why did I do that?

00:16:08.083 --> 00:16:09.668
Okay, Valeria High, on three.

00:16:09.668 --> 00:16:11.044
One, two, three!

00:16:11.044 --> 00:16:12.212
Valeria High!

00:16:12.212 --> 00:16:13.880
All right, guys, we can do this.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.174
This is where we find out
who makes it to Nationals.

00:16:16.174 --> 00:16:18.760
Let’s give it our all.
We can do this. Okay?

00:16:19.344 --> 00:16:20.345
Let’s go, Valeria!

00:16:22.055 --> 00:16:24.891
- Let’s go, Via!
- Let’s go, Via!

00:16:26.017 --> 00:16:29.271
- Go, Via!
- Go, Via!

00:16:29.271 --> 00:16:32.440
- Go, Via!
- Go, Via!

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.119
Let’s go, Valeria!
Let’s go, Via!

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:17.569
Let’s go, Via!

00:17:42.052 --> 00:17:42.552
That’s okay!

00:17:42.552 --> 00:17:43.579
It’s okay!

00:18:33.561 --> 00:18:37.524
- Go, Valeria! Go, Via!
- Go, Valeria! Go, Via!

00:20:12.827 --> 00:20:14.454
You were amazing out there, Via.

00:20:20.692 --> 00:20:21.943
Why are you shaking your head?

00:20:21.968 --> 00:20:24.095
For me, you were
the best one out there.

00:20:31.846 --> 00:20:34.853
If I were really that good, then
we should’ve won, right?

00:20:40.127 --> 00:20:41.878
You all did your best,

00:20:43.017 --> 00:20:44.317
and that’s what matters.

00:20:52.033 --> 00:20:53.326
Rest for now.

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.373
I’ll just be here, okay?

00:21:56.222 --> 00:22:00.268
I could really feel Via’s disappointment
about not making it to Nationals.

00:22:01.936 --> 00:22:02.937
Yes, Pa.

00:22:04.731 --> 00:22:05.732
By the way, Pa—

00:22:06.608 --> 00:22:08.359
Let me do the chores
for now, okay?

00:22:09.194 --> 00:22:10.570
Via’s feeling down.

00:22:11.529 --> 00:22:14.032
I’ll take care of
washing the dishes, too.

00:22:14.949 --> 00:22:16.701
I’ll sleep here tonight, too.

00:22:16.701 --> 00:22:18.828
I’ll have breakfast
sent here tomorrow

00:22:19.746 --> 00:22:21.956
so we won’t have
to wake Via up early.

00:22:23.958 --> 00:22:25.710
Poor kid’s exhausted.

00:22:26.419 --> 00:22:27.921
Thank you so much, Arkin.

00:22:29.214 --> 00:22:30.340
It’s nothing, Pa.

00:22:32.926 --> 00:22:34.761
So, where are you planning
to go for college?

00:22:36.554 --> 00:22:38.264
Wherever Via plans to go, hopefully.

00:22:39.265 --> 00:22:41.267
But I feel like
she’s feeling pressured,

00:22:41.267 --> 00:22:43.811
so I don’t really
bring it up anymore.

00:22:44.646 --> 00:22:46.523
Maybe I’ll just go
wherever I get accepted.

00:22:47.607 --> 00:22:48.983
I don’t want to be away from her,

00:22:48.983 --> 00:22:51.444
but I also don’t want
to be a burden.

00:22:53.321 --> 00:22:57.450
I think Via’s just shy to say
where she really wants to study.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:01.246
Maybe she’s thinking I’d have
a hard time paying for tuition.

00:23:01.913 --> 00:23:03.623
But I’ve been saving up.

00:23:04.958 --> 00:23:08.044
I’m just waiting for her to
tell me where she wants to go,

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.338
then I’ll do whatever it takes.

00:23:12.006 --> 00:23:13.967
She’s thinking
about Diliman, I think.

00:23:14.801 --> 00:23:16.219
That’s why I also
have to study harder.

00:23:16.219 --> 00:23:19.222
They say it’s tough
to get into that university.

00:23:20.807 --> 00:23:21.808
You can do it.

00:23:22.225 --> 00:23:24.602
Nothing’s impossible
if you really want it.

00:23:25.436 --> 00:23:28.565
It’s not easy, but it can be done.

00:23:29.941 --> 00:23:30.942
Thanks, Pa.

00:23:45.248 --> 00:23:46.249
They’re here!

00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:49.002
They’re here! They’re here!

00:23:54.632 --> 00:23:57.260
Congratulations!

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.597
- Congratulations, Yanna and Sam!
- Congratulations, Yanna and Sam!

00:24:00.597 --> 00:24:01.848
Thanks!

00:24:04.517 --> 00:24:06.853
- Thanks a lot.
- We’re really going to miss you!

00:24:06.853 --> 00:24:08.396
Good luck in college!

00:24:08.396 --> 00:24:09.897
Welcome to college life!

00:24:10.773 --> 00:24:12.817
Oh no, Luna’s crying!

00:24:14.277 --> 00:24:15.278
Oh no.

00:24:15.278 --> 00:24:18.323
Hey, how come no one cried
when I graduated?

00:24:18.489 --> 00:24:20.199
Because we were happy
you were gone.

00:24:20.199 --> 00:24:21.743
I mean, happy you graduated!

00:24:21.743 --> 00:24:22.577
Sure.

00:24:22.827 --> 00:24:23.828
You’re too much!

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.540
I’m going to miss you guys.

00:24:30.209 --> 00:24:31.210
All right, all right.

00:24:33.379 --> 00:24:34.380
It’s gross.

00:24:35.548 --> 00:24:37.008
But yeah, I’ll miss you all, too.

00:24:37.925 --> 00:24:38.509
Ouch!

00:24:38.509 --> 00:24:42.180
Even if we all go our separate ways,
we’ll still be friends, right?

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:43.056
Yeah.

00:24:43.056 --> 00:24:44.223
- Of course.
- That’s right.

00:24:44.223 --> 00:24:45.224
True.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:50.647
True! And because of that,
group hug!

00:24:56.694 --> 00:24:57.724
Let’s eat!

00:24:59.447 --> 00:25:00.615
This is so good!

00:25:00.948 --> 00:25:02.909
Even the confetti tastes great!

00:25:05.888 --> 00:25:06.889
How about me?

00:25:14.998 --> 00:25:18.599
I’m so lucky, because
you guys became my friends.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.680
I can’t imagine high school
life without you.

00:26:21.738 --> 00:26:22.989
Why’d you stop?

00:26:23.781 --> 00:26:24.574
Huh?

00:26:24.574 --> 00:26:25.575
Why did you stop?

00:26:26.659 --> 00:26:28.953
Why don’t you join
the Music Club next year?

00:26:28.953 --> 00:26:30.371
You won’t have
volleyball anymore anyway.

00:26:31.497 --> 00:26:32.498
I’ll think about it.

00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:37.712
But if I do join, I don’t wanna perform
in front of people, okay?

00:26:37.712 --> 00:26:40.548
That’s fine. You can just teach the
first years how to play guitar.

00:26:40.548 --> 00:26:41.549
That works too.

00:26:42.508 --> 00:26:44.427
Are you a promoter of
the Music Club or what?

00:26:44.427 --> 00:26:46.053
You keep pushing it.

00:26:47.764 --> 00:26:49.265
I just really love music.

00:26:51.476 --> 00:26:53.895
If you love music that much,

00:26:53.895 --> 00:26:57.607
then why isn’t your college course
about music?

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:06.908
Well, my hobby and my future job
are two different things.

00:27:08.201 --> 00:27:12.622
I just feel like when something
you love turns into work,

00:27:12.622 --> 00:27:13.998
you end up getting tired of it.

00:27:15.166 --> 00:27:16.959
I don’t wanna get tired of music.

00:27:19.545 --> 00:27:21.756
Sounds like you’ve really thought
that through, huh?

00:27:22.715 --> 00:27:24.592
As you grow older—

00:27:25.426 --> 00:27:29.597
As we have grown older, I can
really see how you’ve changed.

00:27:30.973 --> 00:27:34.560
You too, you just don’t notice it
‘cause it’s you.

00:27:35.144 --> 00:27:37.605
But you’ve changed, too.

00:27:39.982 --> 00:27:42.819
Well, I’m happy for you.

00:27:50.146 --> 00:27:53.858
Hey, even if we change a lot—

00:27:55.998 --> 00:27:59.043
No matter what happens, nothing
changes between us, okay?

00:28:00.127 --> 00:28:03.798
How we treat each other. Promise?

00:28:13.683 --> 00:28:14.851
I promise.

00:28:16.514 --> 00:28:17.848
Hey, by the way,
what’s your answer?

00:28:17.895 --> 00:28:19.038
What do you say
about the music club?

00:28:19.063 --> 00:28:20.582
- Huh?
- You’re joining next year?

00:28:33.119 --> 00:28:34.620
Please introduce yourself.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:42.044
Avianna Diaz. Fourth year.

00:28:42.962 --> 00:28:45.131
I’ll be singing
and playing the guitar.

00:28:47.049 --> 00:28:48.384
Ms. Avianna,

00:28:49.427 --> 00:28:51.679
what song will you
be performing for us?

00:28:56.893 --> 00:28:58.060
“Smile.”

00:28:58.519 --> 00:28:59.610
Okay.

00:29:00.021 --> 00:29:01.647
Please sing when you’re ready.

00:29:18.831 --> 00:29:21.876
♪ I find myself smiling, ♪

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:31.569
♪ and you’re the reason why. ♪

00:29:31.594 --> 00:29:37.058
♪ The colors of our
world return anew. ♪

00:29:38.251 --> 00:29:43.590
♪ I find myself smiling. ♪

00:29:43.982 --> 00:29:55.493
♪ I find myself smiling,
and you’re the reason why. ♪

00:29:55.534 --> 00:30:01.832
♪ The colors of our

00:30:01.832 --> 00:30:06.921
♪ You make me smile. ♪

00:30:19.183 --> 00:30:20.017
Thank you.

00:30:20.017 --> 00:30:22.478
All right, just wait for the results.

00:30:26.816 --> 00:30:28.150
Thanks again.

00:30:28.859 --> 00:30:29.986
I’ll go ahead, Kino.

00:31:06.063 --> 00:31:07.231
Via, I’m sorry.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.442
Huh?

00:31:12.069 --> 00:31:14.030
Why are you apologizing? It’s fine.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.323
I know I’m not that good anyway.

00:31:17.658 --> 00:31:18.868
I’m just sorry 'cause—

00:31:19.243 --> 00:31:22.036
we’ll be seeing each other all the time
now, even in the Music Club.

00:31:22.913 --> 00:31:23.914
You passed!

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:26.751
You passed.

00:31:27.001 --> 00:31:28.210
- What? For real?
- Yeah, really.

00:31:28.502 --> 00:31:30.463
You just rigged
my score, didn’t you?

00:31:30.463 --> 00:31:31.647
No, I didn’t!

00:31:31.672 --> 00:31:32.965
Your voice was amazing.

00:31:32.965 --> 00:31:34.425
They were even surprised.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.512
Now I kinda regret making you join.

00:31:39.221 --> 00:31:40.639
Am I being selfish?

00:31:41.932 --> 00:31:44.560
I’m just used to being the only
one who gets to hear you sing.

00:31:45.144 --> 00:31:47.271
Thanks for making me join.

00:31:47.271 --> 00:31:49.106
Congrats!
Welcome to the Music Club.

00:32:29.105 --> 00:32:31.440
Would you get mad if I kissed you?

00:32:36.119 --> 00:32:37.870
Why would you kiss me?

00:32:39.782 --> 00:32:41.951
No reason. I’m just curious.

00:32:43.877 --> 00:32:48.256
Curious?
Is this what they call puberty?

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.710
All right then, there’s nothing
more to it if it’s Kino.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:52.821
No.

00:32:53.319 --> 00:32:54.779
I wouldn’t get mad.

00:33:20.489 --> 00:33:23.159
- I just really don’t know what to do.
- You were really out of—

00:33:25.968 --> 00:33:27.178
It feels so hot here!

00:33:27.203 --> 00:33:28.222
Hey!

00:33:28.247 --> 00:33:30.583
We’ve been looking for you two!

00:33:30.791 --> 00:33:31.847
Yeah.

00:33:32.793 --> 00:33:33.627
Are you okay?

00:33:33.627 --> 00:33:34.628
Huh?

00:33:34.628 --> 00:33:37.006
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:33:38.007 --> 00:33:39.008
What—

00:33:39.008 --> 00:33:39.925
What?

00:33:39.925 --> 00:33:42.052
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:33:42.386 --> 00:33:43.487
Huh?

00:33:43.512 --> 00:33:44.513
I’m—

00:33:45.264 --> 00:33:46.807
What I’m saying is—

00:33:47.032 --> 00:33:49.702
I think I’ll go get some air outside.

00:33:49.727 --> 00:33:51.020
I’ll just go—

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:52.188
Bye-bye.

00:33:52.188 --> 00:33:53.606
Wait, what? Where’s he—

00:33:53.606 --> 00:33:54.565
Where’s he going?

00:33:54.565 --> 00:33:55.566
What just happened?

00:33:55.566 --> 00:33:56.567
What was that?

00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:58.527
I don’t know. He suddenly—

00:33:58.527 --> 00:34:00.529
He suddenly felt hot, I guess.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:03.157
How was your audition?

00:34:05.159 --> 00:34:06.869
Did you pass?

00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:10.164
I knew it!

00:34:10.164 --> 00:34:11.916
You’re amazing!

00:34:11.916 --> 00:34:13.709
I told you so!

00:34:13.709 --> 00:34:15.961
Show us what you did!

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:23.427
Luna and Kierra
were so loud earlier.

00:34:23.427 --> 00:34:24.386
They were so happy,

00:34:24.386 --> 00:34:26.180
like they were the ones who
got into the music club.

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:27.932
And they even
wanted me to sing.

00:34:33.979 --> 00:34:36.649
When there’s a music club meeting,
tell me right away, okay?

00:34:37.942 --> 00:34:38.943
Of course.

00:34:42.613 --> 00:34:43.739
I’ll go ahead, Via.

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:44.990
Huh?

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.576
You’re not coming in?

00:34:47.826 --> 00:34:49.036
Probably not.

00:34:49.036 --> 00:34:50.496
I’m heading out now.

00:34:50.663 --> 00:34:51.664
Bye.

00:34:51.789 --> 00:34:52.915
My guitar.

00:34:52.915 --> 00:34:54.083
Oh, right.

00:34:54.416 --> 00:34:55.417
Okay.

00:34:56.293 --> 00:34:57.294
Okay.

00:35:02.819 --> 00:35:04.417
What was that about?

00:35:04.442 --> 00:35:07.486
Is he feeling awkward because
of what happened earlier?

00:35:07.511 --> 00:35:09.706
Or does he think I’m mad at him?

00:35:20.359 --> 00:35:24.405
I miss Yanna, Sam, and Sevi, too.

00:35:24.405 --> 00:35:25.864
I hope nothing changes
between us, you know?

00:35:25.864 --> 00:35:26.865
No way.

00:35:26.865 --> 00:35:30.536
But yeah, they say a lot of things
change when you get to college.

00:35:30.536 --> 00:35:31.537
Right?

00:35:31.537 --> 00:35:35.291
Even if things do change,
I hope our friendship doesn’t.

00:35:35.291 --> 00:35:36.166
Oh, please.

00:35:36.166 --> 00:35:37.167
We're a solid group.

00:35:37.167 --> 00:35:40.587
Even when I’m ninety, you guys
have no choice but to stay friends with me.

00:35:40.754 --> 00:35:41.839
Wow, ninety years old, huh?

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:42.840
I’m serious!

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.924
Speaking of college,

00:35:43.924 --> 00:35:46.927
Luna and I are taking the Architecture
entrance exam in España.

00:35:46.927 --> 00:35:47.886
How about you, Via?

00:35:47.886 --> 00:35:49.346
What course are
you planning to take?

00:35:52.141 --> 00:35:55.269
I don’t know. Probably wherever
you guys are going.

00:35:55.269 --> 00:35:56.228
What?

00:35:56.228 --> 00:35:57.521
Are you serious?

00:35:57.521 --> 00:35:58.480
Yes.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.898
Come on, Architecture’s hard,

00:35:59.898 --> 00:36:01.275
especially if you’re not into it.

00:36:01.275 --> 00:36:03.819
Well, I don’t really have
any preferences, Luna.

00:36:03.819 --> 00:36:06.780
So anywhere you
guys are going is fine.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.950
I can draw anyway,
that’s enough, right?

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:12.286
Via would probably like that, too.

00:36:12.286 --> 00:36:12.995
Yeah, maybe.

00:36:12.995 --> 00:36:16.533
Honestly, I’m scared to
go to college alone.

00:36:16.558 --> 00:36:18.227
Like, without any friends again.

00:36:18.447 --> 00:36:21.575
That’s why I’d rather go
where Luna and Ke are.

00:36:31.221 --> 00:36:32.222
Kino.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:37.936
You’re taking the entrance exam
in España too, right?

00:36:39.938 --> 00:36:41.315
Huh? España?

00:36:41.857 --> 00:36:44.026
Huh? Are you glitching?

00:36:44.026 --> 00:36:45.235
Are you okay?

00:36:47.446 --> 00:36:50.949
Oh, España.
Yeah, I’m in batch one.

00:36:51.408 --> 00:36:52.659
There’s no film course there,

00:36:52.659 --> 00:36:55.275
so it’ll just be my
backup school in case.

00:36:59.375 --> 00:37:01.543
You’ve been quiet for a while now.

00:37:01.543 --> 00:37:03.796
You’ve been reading that
same page since earlier.

00:37:03.796 --> 00:37:05.297
You haven’t turned pages at all.

00:37:05.297 --> 00:37:07.174
I’m on vocal rest because—

00:37:07.174 --> 00:37:09.134
- I’m a singer, remember?
- Vocal rest.

00:37:09.134 --> 00:37:11.053
He’s our future concert king.

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:14.014
But if you ever forget about us,
I swear I’ll bash you online.

00:37:14.014 --> 00:37:16.100
I’ll be your number one basher.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:19.144
Luna only wants to study in España
because there are lots of hotties there.

00:37:19.144 --> 00:37:21.271
True.

00:37:23.315 --> 00:37:25.275
But isn’t Sevi
a varsity player there?

00:37:25.275 --> 00:37:26.819
Maybe he’ll introduce
someone to me.

00:37:26.819 --> 00:37:28.612
Maybe you’ll finally meet
your one and only.

00:37:28.612 --> 00:37:33.659
Like, imagine it’s raining in
España and someone suddenly says,

00:37:33.659 --> 00:37:36.912
“Miss, you might catch a cold."

00:37:39.865 --> 00:37:42.017
That’s my love story right there.

00:37:42.042 --> 00:37:43.043
Maybe it’s Sevi.

00:37:43.043 --> 00:37:45.087
Yuck! Sevi? Seriously?

00:37:45.087 --> 00:37:46.463
- No?
- Hell no!

00:37:47.172 --> 00:37:48.257
No. Never.

00:37:48.257 --> 00:37:49.967
Never.

00:37:49.967 --> 00:37:52.010
You’re crazy.

00:38:05.274 --> 00:38:07.526
What were you gonna say?

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:12.781
Via, I’m sorry!

00:38:12.781 --> 00:38:15.075
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

00:38:15.951 --> 00:38:19.101
Hey, Kino, what are
you doing? Get up.

00:38:19.126 --> 00:38:20.722
I’m sorry for trying to kiss you.

00:38:20.747 --> 00:38:23.417
I shouldn’t have done that.
It was my fault, Via. I’m sorry.

00:38:25.335 --> 00:38:27.624
I’m not even mad about that.

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:30.340
But fine, you’re forgiven.
Now get up already.

00:38:30.365 --> 00:38:31.507
Come on now, quick!

00:38:37.306 --> 00:38:38.515
Are you crying?

00:38:42.144 --> 00:38:43.729
Are you hurt?
Does something hurt?

00:38:43.729 --> 00:38:46.648
Did you scrape your knee?
What is it? Tell me.

00:38:52.279 --> 00:38:53.280
Via…

00:38:57.784 --> 00:38:59.578
I think I have feelings for you.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:13.193
Like this?

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:14.736
Here. G.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:21.159
Wait, let’s take a break.

00:40:21.159 --> 00:40:22.119
I’m hungry.

00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:23.120
Okay.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.413
- I’ve got a sandwich here.
- Let’s eat.

00:40:25.438 --> 00:40:26.940
No, it’s fine. I brought food.

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:29.617
Come on, it’s fine.
Just one bite.

00:40:30.095 --> 00:40:31.471
- Go.
- I’m good. Thanks.

00:40:31.496 --> 00:40:32.456
Come on.

00:40:32.705 --> 00:40:33.706
Hurry up.

00:40:35.299 --> 00:40:36.633
- Fine, just one bite, okay?
- Come on.

00:40:36.633 --> 00:40:37.634
Yeah.

00:40:46.643 --> 00:40:49.479
You’ve got crumbs on your lips.

00:40:56.028 --> 00:40:57.279
No, it’s fine. I got it.

00:41:03.475 --> 00:41:04.476
Wait a minute, okay?

00:41:09.193 --> 00:41:10.194
Via?

00:41:10.462 --> 00:41:11.828
- Oh!
- Were you looking for me?

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:23.513
Would you get mad if I kissed you?

00:41:24.389 --> 00:41:26.183
Why would you kiss me?

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:30.062
No reason. I’m just curious.

00:41:31.063 --> 00:41:32.064
No.

00:41:32.648 --> 00:41:34.024
I wouldn’t get mad.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:37.421
No? Does she like me too?

00:41:37.512 --> 00:41:41.460
Or is it just that easy for her,
like it means nothing,

00:41:41.965 --> 00:41:44.218
because we’re just friends…

00:41:44.777 --> 00:41:46.171
But, for me—

00:41:46.196 --> 00:41:49.199
I’m sorry, I don’t think
I can hold it in anymore.

00:41:49.906 --> 00:41:53.351
Besides… maybe she can like me, too.

00:41:53.376 --> 00:41:57.226
You two might
actually end up together.

00:41:57.673 --> 00:41:59.216
Stop it. You all sound ridiculous.

00:41:59.392 --> 00:42:01.186
Oh, Via’s here.

00:42:02.202 --> 00:42:04.287
Would you approve of Naya if ever?

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.690
♪ So, I’ll say it now. ♪

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:22.239
♪ I like you. ♪

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:28.286
Arkin, can you walk Naya home?

00:42:29.355 --> 00:42:30.305
Come on, let’s go.

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:31.331
Let’s go.

00:42:38.088 --> 00:42:39.929
Kino, you’re lucky,
you know that?

00:42:40.817 --> 00:42:43.538
You already know what
you want to do in life,

00:42:43.906 --> 00:42:45.574
and you’re good at everything.

00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:46.934
I’m lucky because I have you.

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:48.726
When you become an actor,

00:42:48.751 --> 00:42:50.127
I might actually be
your number one fan.

00:42:51.288 --> 00:42:54.445
The question is, do I want to be an actor?

00:42:55.866 --> 00:42:57.617
I know I’m handsome.

00:43:04.054 --> 00:43:05.055
You look beautiful.

00:43:06.181 --> 00:43:07.724
Your suit looks good.

00:43:09.418 --> 00:43:10.961
Really?

00:43:20.589 --> 00:43:22.215
I’m proud of you.

00:43:22.796 --> 00:43:23.797
But...

00:43:34.926 --> 00:43:36.219
J- just a bit.

00:43:36.244 --> 00:43:38.162
I’m just gonna go somewhere.

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:44.913
Via, I’ve passed the exam.

00:43:44.938 --> 00:43:45.976
Film.

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:47.407
Really?

00:43:47.407 --> 00:43:47.908
How about you?

00:43:47.908 --> 00:43:49.034
How’s your exam?
