WEBVTT

00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:10.010
He shot her. I don't know
what to do. He just shot her.

00:00:15.917 --> 00:00:17.619
Oh!

00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:22.422
He's here.

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:41.174
I know, I get it. I'm late.

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:42.644
Honestly, I didn't notice.

00:00:42.777 --> 00:00:45.013
I got a ticket,
and I did stop this time.

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:46.848
Was it a complete stop?

00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:49.249
Not necessarily.
That's poor time management.

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:51.553
By the sound of your voice,
this is somehow my fault?

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:53.186
This
get-out-of-jail-free card--

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.388
Not
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:56.223
That is
a police consultant ID badge.

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:59.459
It's useless. I should just
go back to flirting
to get out of tickets.

00:00:59.594 --> 00:01:01.029
It doesn't work,
but at least it's fun.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.530
Or quit rolling
through stop signs.

00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:05.132
I don't need you to tell me
what I should and shouldn't do

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:07.602
-with stop signs--
-Morgan. Read the room.

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:16.678
You guys are so bad
at pretending to work.

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:18.913
I should put on a clinic.
What's going on?

00:01:19.047 --> 00:01:21.716
Soto's up for captain.
Slot's been open for a while.

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:23.250
Word is
she's got the inside track.

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:24.786
Okay, that's exciting.

00:01:25.954 --> 00:01:28.890
-Is that a good or a bad call?
-I was just about to ask you.

00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:31.258
That's not
what you all thought.

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:32.727
When I have news,
I will tell you.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.928
You two, come.

00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:37.197
911 had a call
a few minutes ago.
You two should have the file.

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:38.600
Here's audio of the call.

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:41.069
<i>He shot her.</i>

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:45.105
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>
<i>He just shot her.</i>

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:47.976
<i>Oh!</i>

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:49.711
<i>He's here.</i>

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:52.847
Dispatch traced the call
to the address of Raina Viera.

00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:55.984
Okay, we could have two victims
and a shooter on the loose. Go.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.301
Raina Viera,
you made a call to 911

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:15.837
about a shooting
and an intruder in your home.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.108
No. I've already
told the other officers,
I made no such call!

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.275
Okay, well,
we listened to the call,

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.012
and it was traced
to this address.

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:26.313
-Anyone else live here?
-I live alone.

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.983
No one else was here. I don't
know what else to tell you.

00:02:29.117 --> 00:02:31.052
It wasn't me,
and that's the end!

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.488
Oh, except that it was.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.624
Are you calling me a liar?

00:02:36.758 --> 00:02:38.559
No, she's just
calling you Gullah Geechee

00:02:38.693 --> 00:02:40.160
from the coastal community
in the southeast.

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:42.797
Yeah, beautiful accent,
but it's also very rare.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.633
In my life, I've only known
one other person who had it.

00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:46.968
My old boss at the DMV.

00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:48.069
Her name was Pearl.

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:50.938
Lord, Morgan.
I got to fire you, girl.

00:02:51.806 --> 00:02:53.841
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:02:53.975 --> 00:02:56.476
Oh, well,
the picture over there of you

00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:59.179
under the loblolly pines that
are native to South Carolina,

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.181
plus your accent,
which I've caught twice now...

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:03.250
- Oh!
- And that's it.

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:06.286
...kinda prove that you did
make that 911 phone call.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.791
Well, unless having an accent
is a crime, you can go.

00:03:09.924 --> 00:03:12.560
We will be happy to go, ma'am,
as soon as we clear this up.

00:03:12.694 --> 00:03:15.362
Would you mind
if we just take a quick look
at your cell phone?

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.098
Why would I lie
about calling you?

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.801
We just want to make sure
you're safe. That's it.

00:03:19.934 --> 00:03:22.335
Well, if it'll make you leave,
go ahead.

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:26.206
No 911 call.

00:03:26.841 --> 00:03:28.676
-Weird.
-Yeah.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.045
Well, just real quick, for me,

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:33.514
otherwise it's gonna drive me
nuts the whole way home.

00:03:33.648 --> 00:03:34.982
You have
such a beautiful kitchen,

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:38.351
so what's up
with these cheap pans
on your stove?

00:03:38.853 --> 00:03:40.253
You know,
I have pans like that.

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:41.455
That makes sense for me,

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:43.256
but it doesn't really fit
into this kitchen.

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:45.560
Is she for real?

00:03:45.693 --> 00:03:48.196
We're good here.
We appreciate your cooperation.

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:49.664
Oh...

00:03:53.668 --> 00:03:56.571
She makes a call to 911
and then she denies it?

00:03:56.704 --> 00:03:58.106
What does that tell you?

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.307
That maybe she saw something,
but now she's afraid to talk.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.577
Exactly. So if someone's
pressuring her to stay quiet,

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.845
how do we leave now?

00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:05.412
Because she told us
to get out of her house

00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:07.115
and she hasn't
committed a crime.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:08.616
Patrol canvassed the area.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.350
No one saw or heard anything,
and my guy swept the place.

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:13.154
There's no sign of foul play
and no intruder hiding inside.

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:15.823
-Right now she's safe.
-Oh, what a relief!

00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:19.392
I'll put in a request
for unmarked surveillance
outside the house.

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:28.435
<i>Roman asked me</i>
<i>to put eyes on you and Ava.</i>

00:04:28.903 --> 00:04:31.572
I sincerely wish
you'd stop using my computer.

00:04:31.706 --> 00:04:33.641
Maybe you should get
a less guessable password.

00:04:33.775 --> 00:04:35.743
I take it you're still worried
about Raina Viera.

00:04:35.877 --> 00:04:38.980
Of course I am.
Soto getting surveillance
approved helps.

00:04:39.113 --> 00:04:41.149
She fast-tracked it,
which actually took some juice.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.316
Maybe it's a sign that
Soto got the captain's gig

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.685
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.054
Okay, so if she moves up
to captain, where do you go?

00:04:47.188 --> 00:04:48.990
Probably in there
as acting lieutenant.

00:04:49.123 --> 00:04:50.625
Then who am I with?

00:04:50.758 --> 00:04:52.260
Someone else.

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:54.461
I don't want to be
with someone else.
Unless it's Oz or Daphne.

00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:56.597
-They're already partners.
-I can just work with them.

00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:58.431
There's no throuples
in law enforcement.

00:04:58.566 --> 00:05:00.868
That's just a failure
of imagination.

00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:05.139
Yeah. Look, I get it.
A mind like yours,
everything is organized chaos.

00:05:05.273 --> 00:05:07.875
So when things outside
your control change,
it's disruptive.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:09.844
I don't like it.

00:05:10.978 --> 00:05:14.515
If there is a transition,
it will be smooth.
We'll make it work.

00:05:15.283 --> 00:05:16.316
'Kay.

00:05:19.253 --> 00:05:20.453
Karadec.

00:05:34.936 --> 00:05:36.369
We did everything we could,
Morgan.

00:05:36.504 --> 00:05:38.940
Did we? It wasn't enough.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.818
Daphne's finishing up
with the neighbors.

00:05:50.952 --> 00:05:53.221
So far, no one saw or heard
anything suspicious.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:54.922
No signs of gunshot wounds
or other damage.

00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:56.791
Looks like
she just fell and hit her head.

00:05:56.924 --> 00:05:58.759
Well, Raina had
three missed calls
from somebody named Lucy.

00:05:58.893 --> 00:06:01.062
-Let's find out who that is.
-Yeah, will do.

00:06:01.696 --> 00:06:03.664
-Huh.
-I got my own "huh" down here.

00:06:03.798 --> 00:06:04.999
Oh, yeah? You first.

00:06:05.132 --> 00:06:07.034
Raina's got a stain
on the back of her shirt.

00:06:07.168 --> 00:06:08.368
Doesn't look like dried blood.

00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:10.104
Dirt maybe, right in the middle
of her back.

00:06:10.238 --> 00:06:11.505
I doubt she put it there.

00:06:11.973 --> 00:06:14.575
I zip myself
into enough dresses.
That's a tough spot to reach.

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:16.310
Yeah, my thinking exactly.
Your turn.

00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:19.213
Well, when you're about to eat
it at the top of the stairs,

00:06:19.347 --> 00:06:20.848
you grab the banister, right?

00:06:20.982 --> 00:06:22.683
Look at all the rings
on her hands.

00:06:23.718 --> 00:06:25.086
There'd be scratches,
but there's not.

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.688
So either she jumped
or somebody pushed her.

00:06:31.092 --> 00:06:32.827
Raina witnessed a murder
and somebody killed her

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.928
before she could
finish reporting it.

00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:35.730
So where's that crime scene?

00:06:35.863 --> 00:06:38.065
According to the neighbors,
there was a wild party
across the street.

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:39.700
Let's start there.

00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:44.605
This place
doesn't look so good.

00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:46.574
So, rough night?

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:49.476
Just a few people over
for a hang.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.212
You mean a couple
of dozen people.

00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:53.446
Throw in some alcohol,
things get out of hand.

00:06:53.581 --> 00:06:55.182
Maybe someone left worse
than they came.

00:06:55.316 --> 00:06:56.751
Or maybe they didn't leave
at all.

00:06:56.884 --> 00:06:58.753
Whoa, I don't know
what you think
happened here, man, but--

00:06:58.886 --> 00:06:59.887
Any guns
in the house, Logan?

00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:01.222
Because we received
a 911 call

00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:02.990
from your neighbor
about a shooting.

00:07:03.124 --> 00:07:04.892
And we're
starting to wonder
if maybe they got shot here.

00:07:05.026 --> 00:07:06.459
Maybe a drug deal gone bad?

00:07:06.594 --> 00:07:08.229
Drug deal? Based on what?

00:07:08.362 --> 00:07:11.431
How about not
judging the cover of a person
without reading the book?

00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:13.433
Oh, boy. It was close.

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:17.605
No, not judging, just noticing
the unicorn sticker
on your mailbox

00:07:17.738 --> 00:07:20.241
signaling to your customers
that you're open for business.

00:07:20.374 --> 00:07:23.878
Customers like that
jittery guy out there just
circling around on his bike,

00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:26.781
waiting for us to leave
so he can come in
and you can sell him drugs.

00:07:27.915 --> 00:07:30.718
Drugs that I'm guessing are in
that drawer that you looked at

00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:32.320
when I mentioned your drugs.

00:07:35.256 --> 00:07:37.191
Oh, yeah, there they are.

00:07:38.693 --> 00:07:40.261
Logan! Hey!

00:07:40.394 --> 00:07:41.662
Right behind ya.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.465
Yo, yo, yo. Give me the bike.
Sorry, man.

00:07:46.634 --> 00:07:47.668
Logan!

00:08:00.448 --> 00:08:03.050
So, Logan,
here's what we're thinking.
Someone died at your party.

00:08:03.184 --> 00:08:05.052
Raina had a front-row seat,
and you killed her.

00:08:05.186 --> 00:08:08.356
I didn't kill anybody.
And Raina, bro,
I was helping her.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.590
Mmm, helping her how?

00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:15.062
You were her dealer.

00:08:15.196 --> 00:08:16.998
I don't identify
by that characterization.

00:08:17.131 --> 00:08:19.467
I'm a legit unlicensed
neighborhood pharmacist.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.936
Hmm. Okay, so, uh, drug dealer.

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:25.473
No. I rob Peter to treat Paul

00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:27.208
when the system denies
the meds people need.

00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:28.609
Hmm.

00:08:28.743 --> 00:08:31.679
-And, uh, what did Raina need?
-Migraine meds.

00:08:31.812 --> 00:08:34.348
She fell on hard times,
lost her insurance,
couldn't afford the meds.

00:08:34.482 --> 00:08:37.585
So I hooked her up.
I really liked that lady.
I would never hurt her.

00:08:37.718 --> 00:08:41.288
Logan, around 9:30
this morning, Raina made
a 911 call reporting a murder.

00:08:41.422 --> 00:08:43.224
-Where were you?
-With Raina.

00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:46.293
She was showing me some
stuff in her basement, things
she could sell for bills.

00:08:46.427 --> 00:08:48.396
Then I get a call from Bones,
so I popped upstairs.

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:50.931
I hang up with him and
then Raina comes back upstairs.

00:08:51.065 --> 00:08:54.168
And she made no mention
of a 911 call
or witnessing a murder?

00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:56.570
No, I swear.
She was completely calm.

00:08:56.704 --> 00:08:58.272
What time
did you talk to Bones?

00:08:58.406 --> 00:09:01.442
Probably around the same time
y'all got that 911 call,
9:30 or so.

00:09:02.511 --> 00:09:08.517
Okay, so Raina calls 911
while witnessing a murder
from her basement?

00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:09.784
That seems weird.

00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:11.919
Yeah, assuming Logan's
telling us the truth.

00:09:12.053 --> 00:09:14.688
But I think I have a way
to check his timeline.

00:09:17.158 --> 00:09:18.459
Black light, huh?

00:09:18.592 --> 00:09:20.661
What are you looking for?
Is this like a fluid situation?

00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:23.064
No, it's not.
There's no way Raina
witnessed a murder in here

00:09:23.197 --> 00:09:25.900
-unless it happened in here.
-Okay, so Logan might be lying.

00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:27.735
If we can find his fingerprints
down here,

00:09:27.868 --> 00:09:29.670
it means
he could be telling the truth.

00:09:29.804 --> 00:09:31.906
Instead of waiting a day or two
for Forensics to dust
and process prints...

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:34.675
- You are bending the rules.
Look at you.

00:09:34.809 --> 00:09:37.278
Logan's behavior tells me
he's got a ton of drugs
in his system.

00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:41.015
That changes
the way fingerprints look
under a black light.

00:09:41.148 --> 00:09:43.552
They shine
brighter than normal.
You see the difference?

00:09:43.684 --> 00:09:45.086
Yeah.

00:09:45.219 --> 00:09:47.321
Yeah, I can almost guarantee
the glowing print is Logan's,

00:09:47.455 --> 00:09:50.024
which puts him here
in the basement, but in order
to clear him as a suspect,

00:09:50.157 --> 00:09:51.792
we have to place him upstairs
at 9:30.

00:09:51.926 --> 00:09:53.294
My turn.

00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:55.896
Do you remember the four beeps
in the 911 call?

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.865
Yeah, it was faint,
but I heard it.

00:09:57.998 --> 00:10:00.434
I don't know what to do.
He shot her.

00:10:00.569 --> 00:10:03.104
Okay, I think that was
Raina's bougie coffee maker.

00:10:03.237 --> 00:10:05.139
<i>Yeah, she was</i>
<i>drinking a cup</i>
<i>when we walked in.</i>

00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:07.441
I think it was set to turn on
at 9:30 in the morning,

00:10:07.576 --> 00:10:08.843
but the thing is,
coffee makers like these

00:10:08.976 --> 00:10:11.011
beep eight times
when the pot is ready.

00:10:11.145 --> 00:10:13.881
I've had some really bad bosses
with great taste in coffee.

00:10:14.014 --> 00:10:15.749
-But we only heard four beeps.
-That's right.

00:10:15.883 --> 00:10:18.587
Somebody turned the alarm off,
and I think that someone
was Logan.

00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:22.389
This proves Logan was here
at 9:30,

00:10:22.524 --> 00:10:25.159
so she definitely
made that 911 call
from down here.

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:26.861
But why? What could
she have seen
from the basement?

00:10:26.994 --> 00:10:28.162
Let's see.

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:32.466
Who are you? Oh, look.

00:10:34.235 --> 00:10:36.670
-2007's calling.
-Raina had a second phone.

00:10:36.804 --> 00:10:38.439
Yeah, but without cell service.

00:10:38.573 --> 00:10:40.941
That doesn't matter. Since '96,
the FCC requires
that all cell phones,

00:10:41.075 --> 00:10:43.410
active or not, have
the capability to call 911.

00:10:43.545 --> 00:10:44.912
Hmm!

00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:46.280
-You knew that already,
didn't you?
-Yeah, I did.

00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:47.681
I was hoping you did too,
'cause I thought

00:10:47.815 --> 00:10:48.883
it'd be nice
to let you have this one.

00:10:49.016 --> 00:10:50.184
Appreciate it.

00:10:50.317 --> 00:10:51.952
Okay,
she turned it on from here,

00:10:52.086 --> 00:10:54.021
made the call from here,
but why? What did she see?

00:10:54.155 --> 00:10:56.824
Three boxes of brand-new
cheap pots and pans?

00:10:56.957 --> 00:10:58.527
Buy one, get two free?

00:10:59.426 --> 00:11:02.531
No, she needed them as backups
'cause she kept burning hers.

00:11:02.663 --> 00:11:05.199
She was leaving the stove on,
and she was also putting items

00:11:05.332 --> 00:11:06.934
from her kitchen
in the wrong spots.

00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:09.870
The pills she was taking
weren't for migraines.
Those pills also treat

00:11:10.004 --> 00:11:11.640
early onset dementia.

00:11:11.772 --> 00:11:13.575
So Raina wasn't lying
when she said
she didn't make the 911 call.

00:11:13.707 --> 00:11:15.776
-She just didn't remember.
-Dementia can rob you
of your memories

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.244
but can also jumble them all up

00:11:17.378 --> 00:11:20.047
so new memories can get lost
and old ones can resurface.

00:11:20.181 --> 00:11:22.149
But something
would've had to trigger it.

00:11:22.283 --> 00:11:23.851
You think while she was looking
for stuff to sell,

00:11:23.984 --> 00:11:25.452
maybe something set her off?

00:11:25.587 --> 00:11:28.222
Yeah, I think so.
And, honestly,
it really could be anything.

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:31.192
It could be a smell or a sound.

00:11:31.325 --> 00:11:32.627
Morgan.

00:11:33.093 --> 00:11:34.161
Oh!

00:11:34.295 --> 00:11:35.729
Or a bloodstained dress.

00:11:35.863 --> 00:11:38.065
-That looks
like a trigger to me.
-Yeah, that would do it.

00:11:38.199 --> 00:11:40.000
So Raina did witness a murder.

00:11:40.134 --> 00:11:42.069
The question is:
when did she see it?

00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:50.377
So Raina witnessed a murder.
We just don't know
when it happened.

00:11:50.512 --> 00:11:52.614
If we can date the dress,
we can date the cold case.

00:11:53.113 --> 00:11:55.482
The earliest age
most people start
to form memories

00:11:55.617 --> 00:11:57.251
is around three or four.

00:11:57.384 --> 00:12:00.655
Given Raina's age,
we can rule out
any cases prior to 1975.

00:12:00.788 --> 00:12:03.057
That's 50 years of cold cases.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.126
15,320 cases, give or take.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.962
Someone needs
to whittle that down.

00:12:08.095 --> 00:12:09.863
Didn't you tell me
one time that vintage
is your love language, Morgan?

00:12:09.997 --> 00:12:13.467
I've never once said
"love language" to you,
but I can take a crack at it.

00:12:17.505 --> 00:12:20.040
Lot of staring. Everybody just
staring right at me.

00:12:20.174 --> 00:12:21.909
Yeah, a little space.
Thank you.

00:12:25.846 --> 00:12:27.014
I need a lighter.

00:12:27.147 --> 00:12:28.550
You just asked for space.
Now you need a lighter?

00:12:28.683 --> 00:12:30.818
Yeah, I'm a complex woman.
Can I have a lighter, please?

00:12:31.285 --> 00:12:33.588
This fabric
has a slight shine to it.

00:12:33.722 --> 00:12:35.889
It's not as glossy as satin,
but it's more polished
than cotton.

00:12:36.023 --> 00:12:37.224
I think it might be Tencel.

00:12:37.358 --> 00:12:38.959
-Anything else?
-Yeah, some scissors.

00:12:40.894 --> 00:12:42.863
You do know this is evidence,
right, Morgan?

00:12:42.997 --> 00:12:44.965
Yeah. Yeah. You should
probably turn around.

00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:53.675
Yep, burns quick and clean.

00:12:53.807 --> 00:12:57.144
This is Tencel, which
was not available until 1985.

00:12:57.278 --> 00:12:58.979
Now the fabric
is just the first clue.

00:12:59.113 --> 00:13:01.181
Is the US registered
identification number
the second?

00:13:01.315 --> 00:13:07.788
It most certainly is, Daphne.
Okay, 178549.

00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:11.959
This dress was manufactured
by Cibrian Creations,

00:13:12.092 --> 00:13:13.762
but they went out of business
in 2015.

00:13:15.262 --> 00:13:18.032
Okay, you guys know
when they started putting tags
in clothes?

00:13:18.165 --> 00:13:21.503
In 1971, manufacturers had
to provide clear instructions

00:13:21.636 --> 00:13:22.870
so that people
wouldn't screw up their clothes

00:13:23.003 --> 00:13:24.271
when they were doing laundry.

00:13:24.405 --> 00:13:27.408
In 1998, the FTC approved
the use of symbols.

00:13:27.542 --> 00:13:30.177
The care tag in this dress,
it's all symbols.

00:13:30.311 --> 00:13:33.180
Now the final piece
of the puzzle
is the one that's missing.

00:13:33.314 --> 00:13:36.250
There's no barcode.
There's no inventory number.

00:13:36.383 --> 00:13:38.653
This dress was made
before the year 2000.

00:13:41.422 --> 00:13:42.791
See, I like this staring.

00:13:42.923 --> 00:13:46.460
That time frame leaves us
with 200 cases.

00:13:46.594 --> 00:13:49.396
Yeah, but Raina's 911 call,
she said the person was shot.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.635
And then there were nine.
No, that's not it.

00:13:54.134 --> 00:13:56.538
Okay, only one case
had a victim wearing a dress

00:13:56.671 --> 00:13:58.172
that looks a lot like Raina's.

00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:01.308
Greta St. John,
25-year-old black woman,
up-and-coming singer,

00:14:01.442 --> 00:14:04.679
last seen
New Year's Eve 2000 at a club
called the Black Jewel.

00:14:04.813 --> 00:14:06.480
She was found across town
in an alley.

00:14:06.614 --> 00:14:08.382
Died of a gunshot wound
to the chest,

00:14:08.516 --> 00:14:09.917
but no weapon found
at the scene,

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.754
<i>no witnesses,</i>
<i>not many suspect interviews.</i>

00:14:12.886 --> 00:14:14.723
The ME didn't even list
a clear time of death.

00:14:14.855 --> 00:14:17.559
The ME noted powder burns
and shrapnel on her right side

00:14:17.692 --> 00:14:19.159
but did very little about it.

00:14:19.293 --> 00:14:20.829
This case
didn't get any attention.

00:14:20.961 --> 00:14:22.630
Young Black woman found
on the wrong side of town.

00:14:22.764 --> 00:14:25.366
Let me guess,
it wasn't a top story
on the evening news.

00:14:25.499 --> 00:14:28.703
Okay, so 25 years ago,
Raina witnessed
the murder of Greta St. John.

00:14:28.837 --> 00:14:30.971
And then was killed
before she could tell us
what she knew.

00:14:31.105 --> 00:14:33.842
It stands to reason
that Raina and Greta
were killed by the same person,

00:14:33.974 --> 00:14:35.710
likely someone
who knew them both.

00:14:35.844 --> 00:14:38.045
According to the file,
there was a guy
named Eddie Friedman

00:14:38.178 --> 00:14:40.180
who managed the Black Jewel
at the time of the murder.

00:14:40.314 --> 00:14:41.949
-Go look, see what he knows.
-Lucy,

00:14:42.082 --> 00:14:44.118
the woman that called Raina
three times,
just got back to me.

00:14:44.251 --> 00:14:46.588
-She's willing to talk to us.
-Divide and conquer.

00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:48.088
You guys track down Eddie.
We'll talk to Lucy.

00:14:48.222 --> 00:14:49.256
Copy that.

00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:54.061
What can you tell us
about Greta St. John?

00:14:54.194 --> 00:14:56.865
Oh, she had a voice
like no other.

00:14:56.997 --> 00:15:01.034
The New Year's Eve show
was her moment.
She was about to go big.

00:15:01.168 --> 00:15:02.871
And did that rub anyone
the wrong way?

00:15:03.003 --> 00:15:04.271
Oh, yeah. Raina Viera.

00:15:04.905 --> 00:15:07.374
<i>So, Lucy,</i>
<i>how did Raina</i>
<i>and Greta know each other?</i>

00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:09.577
They were rivals
at the Black Jewel.

00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:11.078
Raina was a singer too,

00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:13.715
but she didn't like talking
about Greta all too much.

00:15:13.848 --> 00:15:14.982
Any specific reason why?

00:15:15.115 --> 00:15:16.851
I met Raina
when I photographed her

00:15:16.984 --> 00:15:19.353
for a piece I did
in <i>Static Vinyl</i> magazine.

00:15:19.486 --> 00:15:21.922
It was about lost voices
of the '90s,

00:15:22.055 --> 00:15:25.593
talented women who just
never really broke into
the cutthroat LA music scene.

00:15:25.727 --> 00:15:28.663
I think it was hard for Raina
to talk about Greta.

00:15:28.797 --> 00:15:30.598
She defied the odds
when Raina hadn't.

00:15:30.732 --> 00:15:35.269
Greta's evolution as an artist
was...
...something else.

00:15:35.402 --> 00:15:38.238
It made sense to all of us
why her star was rising.

00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:43.678
During that
New Year's Eve show, everyone
knew who the star was.

00:15:47.682 --> 00:15:49.784
This doesn't really sound
like an artist on her way up.

00:15:49.918 --> 00:15:53.487
You're right.
See, that was Greta before.

00:15:53.621 --> 00:15:57.257
And this... is Greta after.

00:16:13.942 --> 00:16:17.277
Oh, wow. That hardly sounds
like the same woman.

00:16:19.046 --> 00:16:21.348
So this song was recorded

00:16:21.482 --> 00:16:23.150
after something happened.
What was it?

00:16:23.283 --> 00:16:24.485
Mac Epps.

00:16:24.619 --> 00:16:26.320
His name came up
in my research.

00:16:26.453 --> 00:16:28.523
He was Greta's manager
at first,

00:16:28.656 --> 00:16:30.290
but then he started working
with Raina,

00:16:30.424 --> 00:16:32.125
and now
he owns the Black Jewel.

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:35.128
So two rivals
and the same manager?
Sounds like a bad idea.

00:16:35.262 --> 00:16:36.865
Did Raina ever talk about Epps?

00:16:36.997 --> 00:16:39.868
Not really,
but I did get the sense
that she blamed him

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.503
for her career
never taking off.

00:16:41.636 --> 00:16:44.839
He was shady. After Epps
got arrested on a drug charge,

00:16:44.973 --> 00:16:47.307
Greta found her voice, I mean,
literally and figuratively.

00:16:47.441 --> 00:16:50.310
But after Epps got out,
he wanted to be a part of it.

00:16:50.444 --> 00:16:51.478
Did Greta give in
to his demands?

00:16:51.613 --> 00:16:53.046
No, and he didn't take it well.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.716
He started harassing her.

00:16:54.849 --> 00:16:56.183
The rumor was the only reason

00:16:56.316 --> 00:16:59.086
he started managing Raina
was to get close to Greta.

00:16:59.219 --> 00:17:01.188
He was using Raina as a pawn.

00:17:01.321 --> 00:17:04.157
I think Raina realized
he wasn't really interested
in her career.

00:17:04.291 --> 00:17:05.727
Then why didn't she leave?

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.830
He was a dangerous man
with powerful friends,
even then.

00:17:08.963 --> 00:17:11.498
And that's why Greta
wanted nothing to do with him.

00:17:11.633 --> 00:17:14.769
He turned her family's life
upside down for decades.

00:17:14.903 --> 00:17:16.638
It explains why everyone
was radio silent

00:17:16.771 --> 00:17:18.706
during
the original investigation
into Greta's murder.

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.543
I should have told the cops
what I knew back then,

00:17:21.676 --> 00:17:23.477
but I was scared.

00:17:23.611 --> 00:17:24.546
We all were.

00:17:24.679 --> 00:17:26.581
If you have any photos
or videos

00:17:26.714 --> 00:17:28.883
from the Black Jewel
that we could borrow,
that'd be helpful.

00:17:29.017 --> 00:17:32.987
You bet. I have
more than you could ever
want or need.

00:17:33.153 --> 00:17:35.723
We think Raina may have been
keeping a secret
that got her killed.

00:17:35.857 --> 00:17:37.391
Do you have any idea
what that could be?

00:17:37.525 --> 00:17:40.028
No, I have no idea
who would want to hurt her.

00:17:40.528 --> 00:17:42.362
I can't believe she's gone.

00:17:42.496 --> 00:17:45.098
She and I got really... close.

00:17:45.232 --> 00:17:47.702
She was
like a second mother to me.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.672
We're gonna find who did this.

00:18:15.863 --> 00:18:18.398
<i>The mailbox is full and cannot</i>
<i>accept any messages</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

00:18:19.366 --> 00:18:21.869
How long
till the lab gets back to us
with the results on that stain?

00:18:22.003 --> 00:18:24.939
Oh, a lot longer
than we'd like. But you know
what's faster than the lab?

00:18:25.907 --> 00:18:26.975
-Me?
-Hmm.

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:29.577
Can I have
everyone's attention, please?

00:18:30.578 --> 00:18:33.748
You may have heard that I was
up for the captain's chair.

00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:36.116
Turns out you're stuck with me.

00:18:38.686 --> 00:18:39.954
Don't be so disappointed.

00:18:40.955 --> 00:18:44.324
Right now, all I know
is they're bringing someone in
from another squad,

00:18:44.458 --> 00:18:47.795
but no matter
who the captain is,
I expect you to treat him

00:18:47.929 --> 00:18:50.098
with the same respect
you treat me.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:51.766
You're still my squad.

00:18:51.899 --> 00:18:54.401
Continue to do me proud
just like you always do.

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:57.237
Let's get back to work.

00:18:57.371 --> 00:18:59.339
-It's not fair.
-Should have been you.

00:18:59.473 --> 00:19:01.308
Clearly they don't know who
keeps things on the rails
around here.

00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:02.944
I appreciate all that.

00:19:03.077 --> 00:19:05.013
Why are you being
so cool right now? I hate this.

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:07.815
What are
this new guy's qualifications?
I'm assuming it's a guy.

00:19:07.949 --> 00:19:09.249
Statistically, yes.

00:19:09.383 --> 00:19:11.418
But you know what I hate?

00:19:11.552 --> 00:19:14.555
Unsolved cases.
We have two right now.

00:19:14.689 --> 00:19:17.491
So how about we focus
on who killed Greta and Raina.

00:19:17.625 --> 00:19:19.027
So, suspects?

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:20.561
Well, Eddie Friedman
alibied out.

00:19:20.695 --> 00:19:23.163
He was at Corbyn Lanes
with his bowling league.

00:19:23.296 --> 00:19:25.933
Lucy Hastings was at
a photo shoot at Griffith Park.

00:19:26.067 --> 00:19:28.435
She was alone, but her pictures
were time-stamped.

00:19:28.569 --> 00:19:30.505
That leaves Mac Epps
as our prime suspect.

00:19:30.638 --> 00:19:32.239
He's built an empire,

00:19:32.372 --> 00:19:35.143
a mix of illicit
and legitimate businesses,
including the Black Jewel.

00:19:35.275 --> 00:19:36.811
Yeah, and he had a motive
to kill Greta

00:19:36.944 --> 00:19:38.980
because she was
about to blow up
and wasn't taking him with her.

00:19:39.113 --> 00:19:41.549
What about Raina? Does he look
good for her murder too?

00:19:41.683 --> 00:19:44.585
Well, Raina moved
into her current home
shortly after Greta's death.

00:19:44.719 --> 00:19:47.387
No way she bought that house
in her 20s
unless she won the lottery.

00:19:47.522 --> 00:19:48.890
Which is why we looked
at the deed.

00:19:49.023 --> 00:19:51.391
The first few years,
Mac Epps's name was on it.

00:19:51.526 --> 00:19:54.529
It was either a gift
or more likely
a payment for her silence.

00:19:54.662 --> 00:19:56.664
A silence she maintained until
a dementia-induced episode

00:19:56.798 --> 00:19:57.999
led her to reveal the truth.

00:19:58.132 --> 00:20:00.668
Any indication Epps knew
that could be a possibility?

00:20:00.802 --> 00:20:04.906
Well, we dug up CCTV footage
from outside of the Black Jewel
a few days ago

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:07.709
-and we found this.
-That is Mac Epps.

00:20:07.842 --> 00:20:09.744
Yeah, doesn't look like
a friendly reunion.

00:20:09.877 --> 00:20:12.080
No, it looks
like a motive for murder.

00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:14.314
I think it's time
to visit the Black Jewel.

00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:30.330
I know your silences, Morgan.

00:20:30.464 --> 00:20:33.568
-My silences? It's not a thing.
-Mm-hmm.

00:20:33.701 --> 00:20:35.203
Oh, it's a thing.

00:20:35.335 --> 00:20:36.971
You get quiet a lot.

00:20:37.105 --> 00:20:39.507
You got family-drama quiet,
a little furrow of the brow

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.943
and you start messing
with your cuticles like you're
trying to dig up a secret.

00:20:42.076 --> 00:20:44.244
There's case-frustration quiet,
clenching of the jaw

00:20:44.377 --> 00:20:47.615
and your eyes start scanning
like you're mentally breaking
apart the crime scene.

00:20:47.749 --> 00:20:50.818
There's the pissed-at-me quiet.
That's a classic.

00:20:50.952 --> 00:20:53.788
It's a stone-cold stare and
a little flare of the nostrils.

00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:55.590
And then we've got this one
right here,

00:20:55.723 --> 00:20:58.126
which is
the something-you-want-to-say
quiet.

00:20:58.258 --> 00:21:00.460
Pursing of the lips,
distant look.

00:21:03.463 --> 00:21:06.567
Whatever. I'm just worried
about Soto, aren't you?

00:21:06.701 --> 00:21:10.270
-Have you talked to her?
-No. I don't plan to.

00:21:12.673 --> 00:21:14.374
-That's it?
-Every cop's wired differently.

00:21:14.509 --> 00:21:16.443
If she wanted
to open up to me, she would.

00:21:16.577 --> 00:21:19.814
Okay, so your silence is just
"do nothing, say nothing."

00:21:20.581 --> 00:21:21.616
Yeah.

00:21:23.217 --> 00:21:25.586
Well, it's dumb,
and I don't care for it.

00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:30.490
-Right back
to the pissed-at-me quiet.
-All right!

00:21:41.736 --> 00:21:44.005
Mr. Epps isn't expecting you,
so I have to ask him
if it's okay.

00:21:44.138 --> 00:21:46.808
It's okay
because I said it's okay. Okay?

00:21:46.941 --> 00:21:48.709
You know what?
Just let him do his thing.

00:21:48.843 --> 00:21:51.979
Otherwise he's gonna pull
his badge out, get all showy.
It's pretty annoying.

00:21:52.113 --> 00:21:53.380
-Hey, boss. We got--
-Mac Epps.

00:21:55.415 --> 00:21:57.952
- Detective Karadec, LAPD.
-  This is my-- -Yo, my man.

00:21:58.085 --> 00:22:00.788
I don't really care who you are
or whatever she is.

00:22:00.922 --> 00:22:03.490
Let me tell you how we do it
in the Black Jewel.

00:22:03.624 --> 00:22:06.493
Make an appointment, come back
during office hours. Cool?

00:22:06.627 --> 00:22:09.396
-Yeah, I don't think so.
-Oh, you can't.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.732
Assaulting an officer
is a serious charge, son.

00:22:11.866 --> 00:22:14.467
I tried to warn you, didn't I?
I just... I just warned him.

00:22:14.602 --> 00:22:18.706
Thank you. Hi. Hi, I'm Morgan.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.440
- Can I scooch?
- Hi. Yeah.

00:22:20.575 --> 00:22:24.679
I'm Julie. I love this jacket.
Girl, I see you,
your style is everything.

00:22:24.812 --> 00:22:25.880
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

00:22:26.013 --> 00:22:27.748
-Is this for everyone?
-You know what?

00:22:27.882 --> 00:22:30.284
I asked the same thing
when I got here
and I didn't get an answer,

00:22:30.417 --> 00:22:32.653
-so I've just been going in.
-You just jumped
right in anyway?

00:22:32.787 --> 00:22:35.056
-You got to. Mm-hmm.
-I like your style too.

00:22:35.189 --> 00:22:37.592
Do me a favor.
Ask your questions and go.

00:22:37.725 --> 00:22:40.561
Two names. Greta St. John,
Raina Viera.

00:22:41.729 --> 00:22:43.998
-What about 'em?
-They're both dead, Mac.

00:22:44.131 --> 00:22:46.634
Greta for 25 years,
case still cold.

00:22:46.767 --> 00:22:48.636
Raina, about 36 hours or so.

00:22:48.769 --> 00:22:50.872
I mean, you got anything
to say about that, Mac?

00:22:51.005 --> 00:22:52.673
Nah, nothing.

00:22:52.807 --> 00:22:56.110
Huh. That's interesting because
you managed both of them.

00:22:56.244 --> 00:22:59.847
Matter of fact, you... you
bought Raina a house shortly
after Greta was murdered.

00:22:59.981 --> 00:23:01.182
Suspicious timing, you know?

00:23:01.315 --> 00:23:04.018
One thing has nothing to do
with the other.

00:23:04.151 --> 00:23:07.054
I made a deal with Raina.
A big one.

00:23:07.188 --> 00:23:09.957
I got the rights to her music
in exchange for the house.

00:23:10.091 --> 00:23:12.293
But you know what?
I lost my ass on that deal.

00:23:13.027 --> 00:23:15.730
Her career never took off,
but I let her have the place

00:23:16.297 --> 00:23:17.698
out of the goodness
of my heart.

00:23:17.832 --> 00:23:19.901
Aw. That's nice.

00:23:20.034 --> 00:23:23.470
Um, speaking of your heart,
you were more
than Greta's manager.

00:23:23.604 --> 00:23:26.439
She had a compass tattoo
on her wrist,
and I see that North Star.

00:23:26.574 --> 00:23:29.243
Perfect match.
Two tools of navigation.

00:23:29.377 --> 00:23:32.380
The compass leads the way.
The North Star holds steady.

00:23:32.513 --> 00:23:33.948
That's so romantic.

00:23:34.081 --> 00:23:35.683
So maybe Greta
wasn't just walking away
from your business.

00:23:35.816 --> 00:23:37.450
Maybe she was walking away
from you.

00:23:37.585 --> 00:23:40.254
Something personal
went down after that
New Year's Eve celebration.

00:23:40.388 --> 00:23:43.658
Ball drops, confetti flies,
and then maybe a few
hours later, the next day--

00:23:43.791 --> 00:23:45.259
You know what?
I've heard enough.

00:23:45.393 --> 00:23:49.297
Now, either y'all leave now,
or I'ma tag my lawyer in
on this.

00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:53.367
JJ Pierce. They call him
"The Badge Collector."
Heard of him?

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.735
I haven't heard of JJ.

00:23:54.869 --> 00:23:56.771
-Have you heard
of nickel dermatitis?
-No.

00:23:56.904 --> 00:24:00.408
It's a reaction to cheap metals
like the ones
that are in foil confetti.

00:24:00.942 --> 00:24:03.110
<i>When I saw pictures of Greta</i>
<i>before midnight,</i>

00:24:03.244 --> 00:24:07.048
<i>her skin was so smooth</i>
<i>and clear, beautiful.</i>

00:24:07.882 --> 00:24:10.284
<i>But at midnight,</i>
<i>the ball dropped</i>
<i>and so did the confetti.</i>

00:24:13.486 --> 00:24:16.757
<i>And wherever the confetti</i>
<i>landed on her skin,</i>
<i>there were hives.</i>

00:24:16.891 --> 00:24:19.293
Nickel can trigger hives
very quickly,
in under a minute.

00:24:19.427 --> 00:24:21.262
<i>They were still there</i>
<i>in the autopsy photos.</i>

00:24:21.395 --> 00:24:23.664
You put all that together,
and what I'm saying is,

00:24:23.798 --> 00:24:27.368
Greta was murdered in this club
just a few hours
after midnight.

00:24:28.002 --> 00:24:29.870
-I'm done talking.
-Well,

00:24:30.004 --> 00:24:31.372
we're not done digging.

00:24:31.505 --> 00:24:33.674
I have a feeling
we'll see you again real soon.

00:24:33.808 --> 00:24:35.409
And next time, put out
some little share plates.

00:24:35.543 --> 00:24:37.578
-It's less confusing
and more sanitary.
-Morgan.

00:24:37.712 --> 00:24:38.946
Oh. See how many times

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.815
- I put my fingernails in there?
- Mm-hmm.

00:24:51.158 --> 00:24:53.861
I just got a call
from Epps's lawyer, JJ Pierce.

00:24:53.995 --> 00:24:55.529
What does The Badge Collector
have to say?

00:24:55.663 --> 00:24:58.733
That if we ever go back
to the Black Jewel
without a warrant,

00:24:58.866 --> 00:25:00.201
he will add to his collection.

00:25:00.334 --> 00:25:02.003
Well,
this is interesting.

00:25:02.136 --> 00:25:03.971
Soto, look at this picture.

00:25:05.172 --> 00:25:06.640
And this one a week later.

00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:09.543
And then this one
a month after that.

00:25:10.011 --> 00:25:11.012
Do you see what I see?

00:25:11.145 --> 00:25:13.581
-She had a baby.
-She had a baby.

00:25:13.714 --> 00:25:14.749
Um, I don't get it.

00:25:15.383 --> 00:25:16.917
Yeah, well,
that doesn't surprise me.

00:25:17.051 --> 00:25:18.719
Love you, LA.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.889
<i>Nobody really</i>
<i>teaches you</i>
<i>about women's bodies.</i>

00:25:22.023 --> 00:25:24.191
<i>People think the party returns</i>
<i>when the pregnancy ends,</i>

00:25:24.325 --> 00:25:25.526
<i>but being postpartum sucks.</i>

00:25:27.261 --> 00:25:29.063
<i>Look, she's got a splint on</i>
<i>'cause she had mommy wrist.</i>

00:25:30.531 --> 00:25:33.667
<i>Repetitive hand</i>
<i>and wrist movements while</i>
<i>holding a baby can do that.</i>

00:25:33.801 --> 00:25:36.070
<i>She ditched the heels 'cause</i>
<i>you're not hauling around a kid</i>

00:25:36.203 --> 00:25:38.039
<i>and a diaper bag in high heels.</i>
<i>That's just dumb.</i>

00:25:38.172 --> 00:25:41.909
And then she started
styling her hair differently
because it was falling out.

00:25:42.043 --> 00:25:45.446
All of these are symptoms
of that three-month period
after a baby's born.

00:25:45.579 --> 00:25:47.081
It's called
the fourth trimester.

00:25:47.214 --> 00:25:50.017
And then when Epps
was behind bars,
Greta really found herself.

00:25:50.151 --> 00:25:53.487
I think
it's because she became a mom,
and to protect her child,

00:25:53.654 --> 00:25:56.057
she had to hide that baby
from a dangerous father.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:58.759
She had Epps's baby,
and when he eventually
found out about the child,

00:25:58.893 --> 00:26:00.795
there was a confrontation
and he killed her.

00:26:00.928 --> 00:26:04.098
How do we prove
he pulled the trigger?
That gun is long gone.

00:26:04.765 --> 00:26:06.434
But maybe
it left something behind.

00:26:06.567 --> 00:26:08.135
Here's what I'm thinking.

00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:10.438
Look at all these pictures
of Epps. Do you see
his right hand?

00:26:12.206 --> 00:26:15.209
-Do you notice anything?
-Yeah, New Year's Eve, no scar.

00:26:15.342 --> 00:26:17.578
New Year's Day,
a bandaged hand.

00:26:17.711 --> 00:26:19.413
He hurt himself that night.

00:26:19.548 --> 00:26:22.116
That's right.
And Greta's autopsy photos,
the right side of her face.

00:26:22.983 --> 00:26:25.686
-Powder burns on her jaw.
-Yeah, given to her
from Epps's gun.

00:26:27.088 --> 00:26:28.722
<i>He shot her in the chest,</i>

00:26:28.856 --> 00:26:30.124
<i>but that wouldn't have</i>
<i>caused the powder burn</i>
<i>on her face,</i>

00:26:30.257 --> 00:26:31.592
<i>so he fired again.</i>

00:26:32.927 --> 00:26:35.496
<i>But that wouldn't have caused</i>
<i>the scar on his hand.</i>

00:26:36.531 --> 00:26:38.265
<i>An explosion would.</i>

00:26:38.399 --> 00:26:41.068
<i>The only way a gun explodes</i>
<i>is by firing it</i>
<i>after it was jammed.</i>

00:26:41.202 --> 00:26:42.903
<i>So the first shot</i>
<i>was to her chest,</i>

00:26:43.037 --> 00:26:44.772
<i>the second shot was a jam,</i>

00:26:44.905 --> 00:26:48.109
<i>and the third shot exploded,</i>
<i>ripping through his hand,</i>

00:26:49.076 --> 00:26:50.311
<i>and burning her face.</i>

00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:54.448
<i>And Raina witnessed</i>
<i>the entire thing.</i>

00:26:54.583 --> 00:26:55.916
What did you do?

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:57.818
<i>Which explains</i>
<i>the blood on Raina's dress.</i>

00:26:57.952 --> 00:26:59.253
Greta!

00:27:00.454 --> 00:27:02.323
That scar
puts the murder weapon
in Epps's hand.

00:27:02.456 --> 00:27:04.291
Looks like
The Badge Collector's
about to get his warrant.

00:27:04.425 --> 00:27:05.960
I'll get it within the hour.

00:27:06.093 --> 00:27:09.130
You go back to the club,
I'll get Daphne and Oz
to go to his home.

00:27:09.263 --> 00:27:11.499
- You stay here.
- What? No, I'm coming with you.

00:27:11.632 --> 00:27:13.834
-Morgan, it's not safe.
-I will be fine.

00:27:13.968 --> 00:27:16.437
Karadec, I need to see
the look on his smug face

00:27:16.571 --> 00:27:17.938
when he finds out
we got him for murder.

00:27:18.072 --> 00:27:19.508
I cannot risk you getting hurt
in a raid.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.675
I'll bring in Greta's killer.
You find her child.

00:27:21.809 --> 00:27:23.978
Fine,
but when you get him--

00:27:24.111 --> 00:27:27.081
You'll see his smug face when
I put him in the box. Promise.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:45.466
Excuse me. Move, move, move.
Excuse me.

00:27:50.271 --> 00:27:51.906
Epps!

00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:54.742
Outta the way. Move, move.
Excuse me. Outta the way.

00:27:56.343 --> 00:27:58.779
Let me go!

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.886
-Put the gun down, Epps!
-Nah, I like where it is.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.756
The place is surrounded.
The only way out for you
is in cuffs.

00:28:08.889 --> 00:28:11.458
You must be crazy if you think
I'm going back inside.

00:28:11.593 --> 00:28:14.529
You should have thought
about that before you killed
Greta St. John.

00:28:14.663 --> 00:28:16.830
Greta got exactly
what she deserved.

00:28:16.964 --> 00:28:22.203
You tell me what kind of woman
keeps a man
from his child, huh?

00:28:22.671 --> 00:28:25.406
For years,
I searched everywhere.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.408
You stand down right now
and I promise you

00:28:27.542 --> 00:28:30.077
I will do everything I can
to help you find your child.

00:28:30.211 --> 00:28:33.881
It's too late! You stand down,
or she's gonna end up
just like Greta.

00:28:34.014 --> 00:28:36.951
If you do that, Mac,
you leave me no choice
but to respond.

00:28:40.421 --> 00:28:43.090
I'd rather be carried by six
than tried by 12.

00:28:44.458 --> 00:28:45.759
Let's see who blinks first.

00:29:02.843 --> 00:29:06.046
Who's that guy?
I don't like him from out here.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.781
-Internal Affairs.
-What?

00:29:07.915 --> 00:29:09.750
You discharge your weapon,
it's a big deal.

00:29:09.883 --> 00:29:11.986
He saved Julie's life,
and it's not like
he killed the guy.

00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:14.188
Doesn't matter.
This is the process.

00:29:14.656 --> 00:29:15.956
Well, should I be worried?

00:29:18.593 --> 00:29:20.961
Epps killed Greta. I think
he killed Raina.
You can't expect me

00:29:21.095 --> 00:29:23.764
-to just sit at home.
-It's policy.

00:29:23.897 --> 00:29:27.736
You have to be cleared
by behavior science section
before you can return to work.

00:29:27.868 --> 00:29:30.971
Come on, Solomon.
You know how long
it takes to get an appointment.

00:29:31.105 --> 00:29:35.376
It's my job to make
sure you follow the rules,
not help you break them.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.811
Okay, fine. So call and get me
on the books first thing.

00:29:37.945 --> 00:29:40.615
-That is not
breaking the rules.
-No, but it's bending them.

00:29:40.749 --> 00:29:42.349
And that is not my style.

00:29:42.483 --> 00:29:43.851
It used to not be yours.

00:29:46.253 --> 00:29:47.921
I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important.

00:29:48.856 --> 00:29:50.324
Every case is important, Adam.

00:29:50.457 --> 00:29:52.426
I'm sorry. Policy is policy.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.596
Doesn't policy say
that we withhold judgments

00:29:54.729 --> 00:29:57.632
and investigate every case
to the fullest extent
of the law, hmm?

00:29:57.766 --> 00:29:59.366
That didn't happen
for Greta St. John.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.335
If the job had been done right,

00:30:01.468 --> 00:30:03.505
I wouldn't have had to pull
that trigger, and Raina Viera
would still be alive

00:30:03.638 --> 00:30:06.940
because Mac Epps would
have been in prison and
not out running the streets.

00:30:10.077 --> 00:30:12.146
What does policy say
about that?

00:30:18.919 --> 00:30:21.488
Just this
once I will make the call.

00:30:22.757 --> 00:30:26.060
Thank you. Whatever time
they have, I'll be there.

00:30:26.193 --> 00:30:27.562
Then go with Morgan
to the impound.

00:30:27.696 --> 00:30:30.464
Check Epps's car for anything
tying him to Raina's murder.

00:30:30.598 --> 00:30:31.832
Yeah.

00:30:38.839 --> 00:30:41.141
I've heard some things
about this consultant.

00:30:41.275 --> 00:30:43.911
Then you know
how invaluable she is.

00:30:44.044 --> 00:30:47.281
Her value comes
with a lot of things
that make me nervous.

00:30:48.449 --> 00:30:51.653
Kind of nervous that has me
looking at your reports
a bit more often.

00:30:52.286 --> 00:30:55.089
What happens with my squad
is none of your business.

00:30:57.057 --> 00:30:58.425
Till it is.

00:31:00.027 --> 00:31:02.697
Good night, Selena.

00:31:14.341 --> 00:31:16.443
Pretty clean car
for such a giant dirtbag.

00:31:16.578 --> 00:31:19.913
Let's just hope
we find something in here that
helps us prove he killed Raina.

00:31:21.616 --> 00:31:22.916
Hey, you okay?

00:31:23.884 --> 00:31:25.386
I'm fine. Why?

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.555
Because you just shot
somebody yesterday.

00:31:27.689 --> 00:31:29.724
You don't go from that to fine
in 24 hours.

00:31:30.257 --> 00:31:32.259
I told you it was a clean shot.
IA will clear me.

00:31:32.393 --> 00:31:35.563
I'm not worried
about your badge.
I'm worried about you.

00:31:36.997 --> 00:31:39.433
Typically when someone pretends
that something big
doesn't matter,

00:31:39.567 --> 00:31:41.168
it means that it really does.

00:31:42.336 --> 00:31:45.038
You and Soto are doing a lot
of pretending that you're fine.

00:31:47.007 --> 00:31:49.611
A cop's worst nightmare
is having
to discharge their weapon.

00:31:50.344 --> 00:31:53.414
Yeah, I bet. How many times
have you done that?

00:31:54.014 --> 00:31:56.984
Three. But I never hit anyone
till now.

00:31:58.686 --> 00:32:01.656
Epps had a gun pressed
to a young woman's temple.

00:32:02.222 --> 00:32:04.692
He'd killed before, would have
had no problem doing it again,

00:32:04.826 --> 00:32:06.728
so I had exactly two options.

00:32:06.861 --> 00:32:09.764
Let him go or shoot him.
Knowing that if I missed--

00:32:09.898 --> 00:32:11.766
You might kill the person
you're trying to protect.

00:32:13.735 --> 00:32:16.270
How'd you do that?
Weren't you worried
you might accidentally hit her?

00:32:17.237 --> 00:32:20.240
Every morning
I start my day
at the gun range.

00:32:20.374 --> 00:32:22.409
Discipline. Repetition.

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:24.879
Endless hours
focused on one thought.

00:32:25.012 --> 00:32:27.247
What would I do if a day
like yesterday ever came?

00:32:27.381 --> 00:32:31.820
I'd seen that shot in my mind
every day for the last
20 years, and I took it.

00:32:33.588 --> 00:32:34.656
I knew I wouldn't miss.

00:32:49.136 --> 00:32:51.205
Check this out.
Some kind of pass.

00:32:51.338 --> 00:32:52.807
Monday is
when Raina was killed.

00:32:52.941 --> 00:32:54.809
It's a visitor's pass
to a federal prison.

00:32:54.943 --> 00:32:57.144
So Epps was visiting a prison
on Monday.

00:32:57.879 --> 00:32:59.379
California's got
13 federal prisons.

00:32:59.514 --> 00:33:01.716
I'll have Daphne and Oz
start calling each one.

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:04.853
Are there any near
the Mojave Desert? 'Cause
that's where this car was.

00:33:06.253 --> 00:33:10.123
Yucca moth. They're dependent
on Joshua trees for survival,

00:33:11.759 --> 00:33:15.663
so if one
hit Epps's windshield,
this car was in the Mojave.

00:33:15.797 --> 00:33:19.066
Well, the only one
out that way is Victorville,
but it's a two-hour drive.

00:33:19.199 --> 00:33:21.536
Epps confessed to killing Greta
25 years ago.

00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:24.371
But if he was two hours away
in the desert
when Raina was killed...

00:33:24.506 --> 00:33:26.841
Then he's not our guy.

00:33:26.975 --> 00:33:30.845
All right, so...
...Raina helped Epps
cover up Greta's murder.

00:33:30.979 --> 00:33:32.479
Which is
why we've been thinking

00:33:32.614 --> 00:33:34.314
Epps pushed Raina
down the stairs to keep
Greta's murder a secret.

00:33:34.448 --> 00:33:36.350
But the prison
in Victorville confirmed
he was there

00:33:36.483 --> 00:33:37.652
at the time of Raina's murder.

00:33:37.785 --> 00:33:39.521
Mm-hmm. That means
Raina and Greta were killed

00:33:39.654 --> 00:33:41.523
by two different people
25 years apart.

00:33:41.656 --> 00:33:43.725
Okay, so if Raina's murder
wasn't about keeping secrets,

00:33:43.858 --> 00:33:45.025
maybe it was about revenge.

00:33:45.158 --> 00:33:46.895
You're thinking
someone found out Raina's role

00:33:47.027 --> 00:33:48.530
in Greta's murder
and then killed her.

00:33:48.663 --> 00:33:50.364
Yep, so now we need to be
thinking about family members.

00:33:50.497 --> 00:33:53.033
Maybe even Greta's child.
We still have no idea
what happened to the baby.

00:33:53.166 --> 00:33:55.469
Well, there was no record
of Greta giving birth in LA.

00:33:55.603 --> 00:33:56.571
She could've
used an alias.

00:33:56.704 --> 00:33:57.872
Or given birth
somewhere else entirely,

00:33:58.006 --> 00:33:59.741
making it nearly impossible
to find her child.

00:33:59.874 --> 00:34:03.343
Well, hang on,
I think I know exactly
what happened to Greta's kid.

00:34:04.077 --> 00:34:05.379
And to Raina.

00:34:10.484 --> 00:34:14.254
Detective, Ms. Gillory, uh,
is there news
about Raina's case?

00:34:14.388 --> 00:34:17.926
-Yes, we've had
a big break actually.
-Thought you'd like to know.

00:34:18.058 --> 00:34:19.794
We finally know who killed her.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.930
That's great.

00:34:24.666 --> 00:34:25.800
It's you.

00:34:25.934 --> 00:34:29.571
What? I loved Raina.

00:34:29.704 --> 00:34:31.739
That might be true,
but you also killed her.

00:34:31.873 --> 00:34:34.742
I couldn't have killed her.
I told you I was at work.

00:34:34.876 --> 00:34:36.744
Right. You said that,
at the time of the murder,

00:34:36.878 --> 00:34:38.947
you were taking pictures
at Griffith Observatory.

00:34:39.079 --> 00:34:41.583
<i>With one</i>
<i>of your cameras that has</i>
<i>the built-in time stamp.</i>

00:34:43.017 --> 00:34:46.119
You know what's more reliable
than a time stamp? The sun.

00:34:46.253 --> 00:34:48.790
<i>A couple cool things about</i>
<i>the Griffith Observatory:</i>

00:34:48.923 --> 00:34:52.627
The observation deck has these
bronze lines built into it,

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.129
<i>and it shows you the position</i>
<i>of the sun in the sky</i>
<i>throughout the year.</i>

00:34:56.631 --> 00:35:00.167
<i>And that weird ring sculpture</i>
<i>with the wire through it,</i>

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.070
<i>that's actually a sundial.</i>

00:35:02.202 --> 00:35:05.472
So your time stamp said you
took those pictures at noon
on a Monday,

00:35:05.607 --> 00:35:09.711
but the sun tells me
they were taken around
3 p.m.-ish last December.

00:35:09.844 --> 00:35:10.945
This is crazy.

00:35:11.079 --> 00:35:12.614
-No, it's not crazy.
-It's science.

00:35:12.747 --> 00:35:14.782
And we can prove
you're the one
that pushed Raina.

00:35:14.916 --> 00:35:17.619
Raina had a smudge
on the back of her shirt,
drove my partner here crazy.

00:35:17.752 --> 00:35:19.453
Yeah, I couldn't figure out
what that stain was.

00:35:19.587 --> 00:35:21.723
So once again, your profession
was your undoing.

00:35:21.856 --> 00:35:23.591
Turns out
it was silver nitrate,

00:35:23.725 --> 00:35:26.360
something photographers
like yourself use when
you're developing pictures.

00:35:26.493 --> 00:35:29.162
You must have had
a small amount of it on your
hands when you pushed her.

00:35:29.296 --> 00:35:31.833
The only question was
why would she do that?

00:35:31.966 --> 00:35:35.103
Why would you kill Raina?
You said she was
like a second mother to you.

00:35:35.235 --> 00:35:37.839
We're guessing that all
went out the window as soon
as you realized

00:35:37.972 --> 00:35:40.074
she was lying to you
about your actual mother,
Greta St. John.

00:35:40.207 --> 00:35:41.776
The last time
we were here,

00:35:41.909 --> 00:35:45.178
you said that Epps terrorized
Greta's family for decades.

00:35:45.312 --> 00:35:48.082
It's not something
you would know, Lucy,
not unless you were family.

00:35:48.215 --> 00:35:51.953
Unless you were the reason
that Greta made
all those sacrifices.

00:35:55.288 --> 00:35:59.159
I just came here searching
for answers
about what happened to my mom.

00:35:59.292 --> 00:36:02.295
Yes, I found Raina, and
I kept my identity a secret.

00:36:02.429 --> 00:36:03.865
But then she...

00:36:03.998 --> 00:36:07.769
...started having
all these episodes,
because of her dementia.

00:36:08.235 --> 00:36:12.106
That's when she confessed to me
that she was a part
of covering up my mom's death.

00:36:12.239 --> 00:36:13.775
But she wouldn't give you
the whole story.

00:36:13.908 --> 00:36:17.177
No, and...
...I find out that
Mac Epps is my dad,

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:19.714
and that
he probably killed her.

00:36:19.847 --> 00:36:23.584
So I just wanted Raina
to tell me the truth
about what happened.

00:36:23.718 --> 00:36:27.187
So I did. I confronted her,
but then she just...

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.825
she flipped out on me,
threatened to never speak
to me again.

00:36:31.324 --> 00:36:34.062
<i>I snapped.</i>

00:36:39.199 --> 00:36:43.336
Look, I swear...
...I swear I did not mean
to kill her.

00:36:44.138 --> 00:36:47.709
Lucy, we got justice
for your mom, and now we have
to do the same thing for Raina.

00:36:47.842 --> 00:36:49.844
Oh, my God.

00:36:49.977 --> 00:36:53.280
You're under arrest
for the murder
of Raina Viera.

00:37:00.822 --> 00:37:02.857
Come on. This way.

00:37:12.166 --> 00:37:16.037
Seriously, Gillory?
We can get you a computer.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.039
I'll go get it myself.

00:37:18.172 --> 00:37:21.209
How am I gonna make you nervous
about your search history
if I'm on my own computer?

00:37:21.341 --> 00:37:22.375
Mmm.

00:37:25.913 --> 00:37:27.148
Y-You were right.

00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:32.220
I'm sorry. Could you say
that again? I didn't hear you.

00:37:33.888 --> 00:37:35.523
What was I right about?

00:37:36.256 --> 00:37:38.893
I've been taking care
of myself for a long time.

00:37:39.026 --> 00:37:42.964
So long that sometimes I forget
what it's like to have
somebody looking out for me.

00:37:43.931 --> 00:37:46.601
You were right about me
not going to the Black Jewel.

00:37:46.734 --> 00:37:50.571
Certain things
a police consultant
does not need to be around.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.076
-You were right too.
-Oh, yeah?

00:37:55.209 --> 00:38:00.248
Mm-hmm. My "do nothing,
say nothing" silence,
it's not optimal.

00:38:01.949 --> 00:38:03.918
You have no plans
to change that, do you?

00:38:04.051 --> 00:38:07.021
Well, I don't need to.
I've got you.

00:38:13.393 --> 00:38:14.896
Something else?

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:17.799
Yeah, one last thing.

00:38:42.455 --> 00:38:44.258
You're allowed
to be pissed with me.

00:38:44.992 --> 00:38:46.828
-Morgan, what did you do?
-Nothing.

00:38:46.961 --> 00:38:49.429
No, I didn't mean you're
allowed to be pissed at me.

00:38:49.564 --> 00:38:51.232
You can. You're my boss.

00:38:51.364 --> 00:38:53.167
You can do whatever you want,
but that's not
what I'm talking about.

00:38:53.301 --> 00:38:56.469
I feel like I lost track of
this conversation
before it started.

00:39:01.474 --> 00:39:03.476
Despite your
overwhelming qualifications,

00:39:03.611 --> 00:39:05.513
you were passed over
for captain.

00:39:05.646 --> 00:39:08.816
And I have to assume
that part of you wonders
if that has anything to do

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:10.518
with you being a woman.

00:39:10.651 --> 00:39:12.854
-Because if it were me--
-You would have gone
scorched earth.

00:39:12.987 --> 00:39:16.190
Oh, absolutely,
and I would have loved
every single second of it,

00:39:16.324 --> 00:39:18.292
so they're lucky
that you're not me.

00:39:18.993 --> 00:39:20.228
You're you.

00:39:21.361 --> 00:39:23.965
You gotta be strong
for everybody out there.

00:39:24.098 --> 00:39:25.700
I understand that.

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.536
One of the beautiful things
about me not being a cop is--

00:39:28.669 --> 00:39:31.438
Is that
I can be pissed with you.

00:39:32.039 --> 00:39:34.942
Anything you need.
Anytime you need it.

00:39:35.977 --> 00:39:37.444
I could just be your friend.

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.521
I'm pissed.
It should have been me.

00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:51.359
Yeah.

00:39:54.394 --> 00:39:56.931
This never happened.

00:39:57.665 --> 00:40:01.068
I never even cared in
the first place. I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:40:17.251 --> 00:40:18.686
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:23.124
All I want is
to enter my house justified.

00:40:25.192 --> 00:40:26.193
Okay.

00:40:26.761 --> 00:40:28.629
It's just a line from
an old western I love.

00:40:28.763 --> 00:40:31.132
Mmm.
It's a line from the Bible.

00:40:32.333 --> 00:40:35.136
That's right, it is.
Peckinpah stole it.

00:40:36.436 --> 00:40:38.005
Anyway,
it's my clumsy way of saying

00:40:38.139 --> 00:40:40.675
you look like somebody
who's proud
of a good day's work.

00:40:42.643 --> 00:40:44.512
Thank you. I am.

00:40:45.445 --> 00:40:47.415
I'm also so tired
I might fall asleep in my car.

00:40:47.548 --> 00:40:50.418
All I want is to fall asleep
in my car justified.

00:41:01.562 --> 00:41:04.198
So what's someone like you
doing in a police station?

00:41:04.332 --> 00:41:06.267
Trying to get that mustache
to make sense?

00:41:08.903 --> 00:41:10.004
That's good.

00:41:11.005 --> 00:41:12.440
I've heard about you.

00:41:14.108 --> 00:41:16.344
-Excuse me?
-Morgan Gillory, right?

00:41:17.211 --> 00:41:19.180
Major Crime's secret weapon.

00:41:21.248 --> 00:41:24.852
I didn't mean to freak you out.
I've just been
looking forward to meeting you.

00:41:27.655 --> 00:41:28.756
Okay.

00:41:31.726 --> 00:41:34.161
-Are you not getting off?
-Nah, I was supposed
to get off at three.

00:41:34.295 --> 00:41:36.297
I just wanted
to finish our conversation.

00:41:37.164 --> 00:41:40.134
Third floor. That's Command.

00:41:40.835 --> 00:41:43.637
So it is. Nick Wagner.

00:41:45.039 --> 00:41:46.574
Your new captain.
