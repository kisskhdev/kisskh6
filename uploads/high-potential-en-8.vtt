00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.899
You give
Morgan Gillory a puzzle,

00:00:03.037 --> 00:00:05.315
<i>she won't stop thinking
about it until it's solved.</i>

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.216
-  <i>Hey, any news?</i>
-  <i>We found Roman.</i>

00:00:09.354 --> 00:00:11.218
-  <i>Sending you a photo now.</i>
-  <i>That's not Roman.</i>

00:00:11.356 --> 00:00:13.323
I think someone's been
on my tail the past few days.

00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:16.706
Maybe you should just
hide the bag, because
whoever Roman's running from

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:18.259
might not want
what's inside getting out.

00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:21.366
If we could just
keep this between us.

00:00:21.504 --> 00:00:22.953
We'll keep the circle small.

00:00:23.092 --> 00:00:25.197
<i>Let's run this stack of photos
through facial recognition.</i>

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:26.923
<i>Who are you?</i>

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.098
<i>I want that backpack.</i>

00:00:29.891 --> 00:00:32.929
-  <i>A theft
of major artwork...</i>
- Painted by Rembrandt in 1645.

00:00:33.067 --> 00:00:35.414
<i>The thief wanted
this painting for a reason.</i>

00:00:36.243 --> 00:00:38.797
<i>Rhys just flew in
to help us find
our missing painting.</i>

00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:40.074
I'm an
art recovery specialist.

00:00:40.212 --> 00:00:41.972
If I can recover
the Rembrandt safely,

00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:44.596
<i>the insurance company can avoid
cutting a rather large check.</i>

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:46.356
<i>You have any idea
who it might be?</i>

00:00:46.494 --> 00:00:49.256
Well, the Internet
seems to think so.
Some call him Jean-Baptiste.

00:00:49.394 --> 00:00:50.947
If we find <i>The Young Girl,</i>

00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:53.915
we should be returning it
to Miriam Weisman,
not the Fosters.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.022
<i>So you go back
to the crime scene on your own
without a police escort?</i>

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.335
<i>But if we didn't,
we wouldn't have gotten this.</i>

00:00:59.473 --> 00:01:01.268
Detective Karadec
and I can handle it from here.

00:01:01.406 --> 00:01:03.718
Are you kicking me
off the case?

00:01:03.856 --> 00:01:06.238
<i>Don't worry.
The ransomer
will turn up soon enough.</i>

00:01:06.376 --> 00:01:09.310
That's our guy. Let's go!
He was getting away.

00:01:09.448 --> 00:01:12.037
<i>Jean-Baptiste
might not exist.
He could be a myth.</i>

00:01:12.175 --> 00:01:14.626
<i>The guard shot him
in the left shoulder,
and he fled empty-handed.</i>

00:01:14.764 --> 00:01:17.146
I'm down at the museum, and
you're gonna wanna see this.

00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:20.770
Our case
just got blown wide open.

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:59.257
Oh, my God.

00:01:59.395 --> 00:02:00.637
Damn it, Clark.

00:02:00.775 --> 00:02:04.779
Dear God. That's not okay.

00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:07.575
No, you're big mad.
Yo. What's the problem?
You love this kind of stuff.

00:02:07.713 --> 00:02:08.990
You scared me.
This is where I work.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.958
Okay. I'm sorry. You love
this kind of stuff though.

00:02:11.096 --> 00:02:13.063
Not this kind of stuff, okay?

00:02:13.202 --> 00:02:15.963
Okay, I'm sorry. I just
couldn't wait to see you.

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:17.413
Been thinking
about you all day.

00:02:18.276 --> 00:02:20.001
- All day?
- Well, most of the day.

00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:22.142
- Mmm.
- Give me some.

00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:27.457
Mmm.

00:02:27.595 --> 00:02:29.494
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

00:02:29.632 --> 00:02:30.633
Where are my keys?

00:02:31.358 --> 00:02:32.566
Whoa.

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:50.170
And you didn't see anyone
leaving the area
before you found him?

00:02:50.308 --> 00:02:52.068
No one.

00:02:52.206 --> 00:02:53.794
Yeah, if she hadn't
dropped her keys, we might not
have even noticed him.

00:02:53.932 --> 00:02:55.347
Well, if you
think of anything...

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.695
Does this have something to do
with the painting
that got stolen?

00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:09.292
Morgan.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.121
- You called her?
- I did.

00:03:17.576 --> 00:03:21.787
<i>♪ Such a remarkable day ♪</i>

00:03:21.925 --> 00:03:26.344
<i>♪ We're friendly
Thanks to you ♪</i>

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.387
You remember the museum
director. Cyrus Carrow, 48.

00:03:35.525 --> 00:03:38.183
Cause of death:
Blunt force trauma
to the back of the head.

00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:41.428
Possibly his own
tire iron, which is missing
from his trunk.

00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:45.915
So...  ...our friend
here has a $20 million painting
stolen from his museum,

00:03:46.053 --> 00:03:47.641
and two days later,
he winds up dead.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.022
What are the odds
those things aren't connected?

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.991
Either he knew something
about the theft
or he knew who did.

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.717
Maybe they got to him
before he could get to us.

00:03:54.855 --> 00:03:56.926
Any chance
we're looking at Jean-Baptiste?

00:03:57.064 --> 00:03:59.791
Not likely.
Jean-Baptiste stole paintings
from across the world.

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:01.171
Cyrus wasn't a traveler.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.277
Maybe he and Jean-Baptiste
were working together.

00:04:03.415 --> 00:04:06.176
Hmm. You think
he's the one who called you
to set up the ransom?

00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:09.525
I didn't recognize
the voice, but he did
hand me the Polaroid.

00:04:09.663 --> 00:04:13.114
So we can't be sure
if our vic was a witness
or an accomplice.

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:15.600
When was he killed?

00:04:15.738 --> 00:04:18.119
Um, ME established time
of death within the last hour.

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.293
Oh, thank God.

00:04:20.777 --> 00:04:22.641
It's just good
that we got here so quickly.

00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:25.437
He was wearing this
at the museum.

00:04:25.575 --> 00:04:28.992
Yeah, so why would our killer
leave a watch worth 200 grand
on the ground?

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.479
Why go through all that trouble
to take it off his wrist
just to what, forget it?

00:04:32.617 --> 00:04:33.756
Well, it's fake.

00:04:34.653 --> 00:04:36.690
Yeah, if it was real,
the second hand would glide

00:04:36.828 --> 00:04:38.070
and not jump around
when it ticks.

00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:39.313
Plus, the engraving's
too shallow.

00:04:39.451 --> 00:04:40.625
Our techs will take a look.

00:04:41.936 --> 00:04:43.904
Sounds good. I'm gonna
skip out for a little bit.

00:04:44.836 --> 00:04:47.252
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, just kids' stuff.

00:04:47.735 --> 00:04:48.943
Need a ride?

00:04:49.668 --> 00:04:50.773
No, I wanna walk.

00:05:19.595 --> 00:05:21.390
<i>And a bin
that needs to be emptied
less often...</i>

00:05:21.528 --> 00:05:23.564
Oh. Sorry,
just grabbing a towel.

00:05:23.702 --> 00:05:25.048
- Made a mess.
- That's okay.

00:05:25.186 --> 00:05:26.222
- I'll get it.
- Sure.

00:05:32.297 --> 00:05:33.574
Morgan. Morgan.

00:05:33.712 --> 00:05:35.714
What... You followed me?

00:05:35.852 --> 00:05:37.820
You showed up to a crime scene
and left two minutes later.

00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.098
Yes, I followed you.
What the hell's going on?

00:05:42.652 --> 00:05:44.240
I think Rhys is Jean-Baptiste.

00:05:45.137 --> 00:05:46.932
Rhys, the art consultant?

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.384
No, the peanut butter cup.
Yes, same guy. Only I don't
think he recovers art.

00:05:50.522 --> 00:05:52.490
I think he steals it. Or both.
I don't know.

00:05:52.628 --> 00:05:54.423
I just know that
there is a crate in his room,

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.286
and I think
our <i>Young Girl</i> is inside.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:58.979
Settle down. It's a painting.

00:05:59.566 --> 00:06:01.533
Um... Okay. That's it?

00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:04.364
You heard he's got an art
crate, and now you think he's
an international art thief?

00:06:04.502 --> 00:06:08.575
No, I saw it, and I also saw
a scar on his left shoulder
from a bullet wound

00:06:08.713 --> 00:06:10.887
just like Jean-Baptiste
in the same spot.

00:06:11.025 --> 00:06:13.959
- Okay, well, how did you
see his scar?
- Huh?

00:06:14.097 --> 00:06:15.927
The scar. You said you saw it.

00:06:18.895 --> 00:06:20.241
Um...

00:06:20.966 --> 00:06:23.555
I can tell you're making
a face. Could you translate
that face for me?

00:06:23.693 --> 00:06:27.110
Yeah. Yeah.
You know.

00:06:28.215 --> 00:06:29.975
He and I... We...

00:06:31.114 --> 00:06:32.978
Oh. Oh.

00:06:33.116 --> 00:06:35.878
You know what? It shocked
me too. I don't know.
Can we move past that part?

00:06:36.016 --> 00:06:37.673
We have to rethink
this entire investigation.

00:06:37.811 --> 00:06:39.468
Okay, I think you're being
a little dramatic.

00:06:39.606 --> 00:06:41.677
No, Rhys has been
with us every step
from the heist to the murder.

00:06:41.815 --> 00:06:44.852
I understand that.
That's why I need
to peek inside that crate.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.407
Morgan, you can't break
into someone's room without
a warrant. You know that.

00:06:47.545 --> 00:06:49.029
Obviously,
if I find something important,

00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:50.686
I'm gonna say that I saw it
when he invited me in.

00:06:50.824 --> 00:06:52.135
That doesn't
make it better, Morgan.

00:06:52.273 --> 00:06:54.655
Now you're just adding perjury
to an unlawful search.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:56.795
Good point. I'll jot that down.

00:06:56.933 --> 00:06:58.487
Morgan. Mor...

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:31.071
Hey.

00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:33.522
Well, hello.
Where did you disappear to?

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.147
Um, I had to go
work on another case.

00:07:38.285 --> 00:07:40.183
- Oh.
<i>- Yeah, I know.</i>

00:07:40.321 --> 00:07:44.256
It's like I wish people would
just stop killing
each other all the time.

00:07:44.394 --> 00:07:46.604
You know,
it's like it's enough already.

00:07:47.846 --> 00:07:49.469
Well, I may head back
to my hotel room soon.

00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:56.337
Why? Um, I just...
There was so much work
to be done over there, right?

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.961
And what's-what's going on
with that watch?
Remember that watch?

00:08:00.065 --> 00:08:02.585
- Are you sure
everything's okay?
<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>

00:08:04.656 --> 00:08:06.969
Because we kinda got
interrupted earlier.

00:08:07.107 --> 00:08:08.729
We really did.

00:08:08.867 --> 00:08:12.733
Maybe... I don't know.
We can pick things up
where we left off.

00:08:24.365 --> 00:08:25.988
Did you find the painting?

00:08:26.126 --> 00:08:28.369
I found a painting.
I did not find the painting.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.303
So we have no idea
if Rhys is Jean-Baptiste
or our killer.

00:08:31.441 --> 00:08:33.167
I'm pretty sure
he's Jean-Baptiste,

00:08:33.305 --> 00:08:36.239
but we both know
he's not our killer because
he has an alibi, remember?

00:08:36.377 --> 00:08:40.554
Right. Well, a scar's
not enough of a smoking gun,
Morgan. We need more.

00:08:40.692 --> 00:08:42.245
Well, I'll find more.

00:08:42.383 --> 00:08:44.316
It's how you'll get more
that worries me.

00:08:44.454 --> 00:08:46.836
You know what? I don't
need this from you right now.

00:08:46.974 --> 00:08:48.942
And I don't need Wagner
going off on you again.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.495
So if you really think Rhys
is Jean-Baptiste,

00:08:50.633 --> 00:08:52.186
we need to bring the captain
up to speed.

00:08:52.324 --> 00:08:54.223
Absolutely not. No.

00:08:54.361 --> 00:08:57.122
The only thing you need to do
is get the captain to bring me
back on the case.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.090
And how should I go
about doing that exactly?

00:08:59.228 --> 00:09:00.781
Well, you can start
by keeping your mouth shut

00:09:00.919 --> 00:09:02.334
about everything that happened
in the hotel room.

00:09:02.472 --> 00:09:04.129
Hmm. Okay. So lie to my captain

00:09:04.267 --> 00:09:05.890
about where you were
and how we know what we know.

00:09:06.028 --> 00:09:07.581
Just come up with something
that makes sense

00:09:07.719 --> 00:09:09.652
and-and makes the captain
trust me again.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.689
You're making this harder
than it needs to be.

00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:21.491
I'm sorry.

00:09:27.739 --> 00:09:30.708
So now we need to catch a thief
and a murderer.

00:09:31.329 --> 00:09:33.055
Detective Karadec,
glad you could join us.

00:09:33.193 --> 00:09:34.574
Captain.

00:09:35.057 --> 00:09:39.717
Gillory. I'm sure you'll find
another case in need of
your unique talents.

00:09:43.272 --> 00:09:45.930
They're gonna have questions
about the victim
at the press conference.

00:09:46.068 --> 00:09:47.448
What do we know
about Cyrus Carrow?

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:50.762
No priors, no kids, unmarried,
was born in the Philippines

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.522
and got a master's in Sculpture
here in LA.

00:09:52.661 --> 00:09:55.215
Cyrus was the museum director
for five years.

00:09:55.353 --> 00:09:57.907
We looked into
all the staff after the heist.
Nothing flagged.

00:09:58.045 --> 00:09:59.426
What about his social media?

00:09:59.564 --> 00:10:02.843
This was his last post
taken two hours
before he was murdered.

00:10:03.326 --> 00:10:06.467
Find out where.
What about our ransomer
with the tinted windows?

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.470
We ran the plates. The car
is registered to a Lou Fowler.

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:10.851
We put a BOLO out on the car.

00:10:10.989 --> 00:10:12.542
Any connections
with Jean-Baptiste?

00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:14.993
Nothing yet.
We still don't know
who he is or if he even exists.

00:10:15.131 --> 00:10:17.927
I'm a skeptic, but...
...I'd love to be proven wrong.

00:10:18.065 --> 00:10:20.654
And the ransomer
hasn't called you again
to make any demands?

00:10:20.792 --> 00:10:22.725
No, none of my contacts
has seen or heard a whisper

00:10:22.863 --> 00:10:26.142
about the stolen painting on
the dark web or anywhere else.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.146
Maybe it just hasn't surfaced
or whoever took it
is being real careful.

00:10:32.252 --> 00:10:36.808
Great. So we're looking for
an art thief and a car thief
who could be the same guy,

00:10:36.946 --> 00:10:39.500
but the only suspect
we've been able to identify

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.572
is still
Miriam Weisman's grandson.

00:10:42.711 --> 00:10:45.403
So will someone find out
what he was doing
while Detective Karadec

00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:47.025
and I were running
every red in the city?

00:10:47.163 --> 00:10:51.996
My father bought that painting
in 1932. We lived in Krakow.

00:10:52.134 --> 00:10:55.102
I was the only one
in our family that survived.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.692
When the Nazis came,
they took everything.

00:10:59.382 --> 00:11:02.247
Morgan and I could
go by Cyrus's place,
see if we can find anything.

00:11:02.385 --> 00:11:04.905
Just you, Detective.
Morgan's benched.

00:11:05.043 --> 00:11:07.528
Forrester and Ozdil,
if there's a connection

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.565
between Cyrus and
Jean-Baptiste, I wanna know.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.500
Let's hope we have
a hell of a lot more to say the
next time I talk to the press.

00:11:13.638 --> 00:11:15.019
Go follow him.

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.199
So what's good around here?

00:11:23.337 --> 00:11:28.239
Uh, you can have
some of my carrots
or somebody else's pretzels.

00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:33.347
So this is
the consultant's corner, huh?
Where we wait to be called on?

00:11:34.348 --> 00:11:35.695
You maybe. Not me. I'm out.

00:11:38.111 --> 00:11:42.425
Look, about earlier,
I truly had no plans.
I was... It just...

00:11:42.563 --> 00:11:44.462
It's... Honestly...
...it's fine.

00:11:45.049 --> 00:11:47.983
We got a little carried away.
It's... It's all good.

00:11:49.191 --> 00:11:52.884
Okay. So, how's that other case
coming along?

00:11:53.022 --> 00:11:54.714
You know,
the one you had to check on?

00:11:54.852 --> 00:11:56.957
Yeah, good, really good.
Solved it.

00:11:57.095 --> 00:11:58.303
- Already?
- Yep.

00:11:58.441 --> 00:12:01.444
I know. Some of these cases
are tough, you know?

00:12:01.582 --> 00:12:04.137
And then some are
just kinda open-and-shut.

00:12:04.275 --> 00:12:06.139
Real grab bag
here at Major Crimes.

00:12:08.451 --> 00:12:11.006
- Well, congratulations.
- Mm-hmm.

00:12:12.007 --> 00:12:13.249
Um...

00:12:13.387 --> 00:12:14.630
I've given it some thought.

00:12:20.567 --> 00:12:22.396
I'm gonna go
with somebody else's pretzels.

00:12:38.033 --> 00:12:40.863
- Captain, you got a second?
- Later, Detective.

00:12:41.001 --> 00:12:43.141
You know how the press gets
if we keep them waiting.

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:45.799
I'd like Morgan back
on the Jean-Baptiste case
with me, sir.

00:12:45.937 --> 00:12:47.974
- Ah, would you?
- You would too

00:12:48.112 --> 00:12:50.252
if you'd worked as many
cases with her as I have.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.499
- Where'd you go?
- I'm not sure I understand.

00:12:56.637 --> 00:12:59.882
Back at the crime scene,
you took off. Both of you.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.402
I'm finding it hard
to keep track of you two.

00:13:03.023 --> 00:13:04.784
So I think
you work this one solo.

00:13:05.474 --> 00:13:11.135
Captain. I work with Morgan.
On every case.

00:13:11.273 --> 00:13:15.208
Now I know what
I signed up for. If she
messes up again, it's on me.

00:13:28.842 --> 00:13:30.879
I mean, who carries around
a briefcase and never
looks inside of it?

00:13:31.017 --> 00:13:32.190
Morgan, can we focus, please?

00:13:32.881 --> 00:13:35.193
Fine. What'd you say to Wagner
to get me back on the case?

00:13:35.331 --> 00:13:37.437
I spoke to him
cop to cop, and he agreed.
Simple as that.

00:13:39.922 --> 00:13:41.717
- You're not gonna
let this go, are you?
- What do you think?

00:13:41.855 --> 00:13:44.409
- Look, Wagner knows
that you're...
- Yeah?

00:13:44.547 --> 00:13:45.859
...you're a wild card, okay?

00:13:45.997 --> 00:13:47.896
But he wants to know everything
that's going on with you.

00:13:48.034 --> 00:13:50.415
Same goes for me.
If we do that,
then we stay on his good side.

00:13:50.553 --> 00:13:53.591
But if we keep hiding things
from him, it's my ass.

00:13:53.729 --> 00:13:56.076
- But we are
hiding things from him.
- I'm well aware.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:57.906
Then you need to
watch your ass.

00:13:58.044 --> 00:13:59.700
Here's, uh,
Cyrus's apartment.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:04.844
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:14:07.708 --> 00:14:10.366
Cyrus lived alone.
Someone's in there.

00:14:12.023 --> 00:14:13.749
We didn't
expect anyone to be here.

00:14:13.887 --> 00:14:17.718
We're very sorry
for your loss, Emilio.
How long did you know Cyrus?

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:20.031
Cyrus and I started dating
a few months ago.

00:14:21.032 --> 00:14:23.448
A friend introduced us right
when I arrived from Colombia,

00:14:23.586 --> 00:14:25.312
and, uh, we just clicked.

00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:28.143
He asked me to move in with him
almost right away.

00:14:29.282 --> 00:14:32.319
When he stopped
answering my texts, I started
to worry and came home.

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:35.081
That's when I saw the news.

00:14:37.255 --> 00:14:41.742
I'm so sorry. You know,
my partner and I met Cyrus.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.779
He seemed like
a very sweet man.

00:14:44.573 --> 00:14:46.264
I thought we'd be
together forever.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.716
Can you think
of anybody who might've
wanted to hurt him?

00:14:49.854 --> 00:14:51.166
Cyrus? No.

00:14:51.718 --> 00:14:53.099
And what you do for work?

00:14:53.237 --> 00:14:55.756
I'm a language instructor
for IFLA.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.587
International Foreign Language
Assistance Program.

00:14:58.725 --> 00:15:00.865
Well, these sure are beautiful.

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:05.628
Oh, yes, thank you.
They're 18th-century
Italian Baroque.

00:15:05.766 --> 00:15:08.631
- Oh, I know.
I love the floral motif.
- Yeah.

00:15:10.081 --> 00:15:11.324
Was Cyrus
the collector or were you?

00:15:11.462 --> 00:15:13.774
I started getting Cyrus
into antiquing.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:17.226
Uh, we picked those up
last weekend at
the Rose Bowl flea market.

00:15:17.364 --> 00:15:20.678
What a find.
This one is so shiny.

00:15:20.816 --> 00:15:23.267
What do you use
to polish yours? Ferric oxide?

00:15:27.133 --> 00:15:33.415
Uh, I, uh, don't remember
what we used. Some kind of
cleaning product. Why?

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:37.660
Oh, you can use ferric oxide
to polish metals,

00:15:37.798 --> 00:15:42.182
but if you add a little bit
of powdered aluminum to it,
you get thermite,

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.288
<i>which is
a pyrotechnic composition</i>

00:15:44.426 --> 00:15:48.637
that can burn
up to 4500 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:15:48.775 --> 00:15:54.367
So people use it for things
like welding or making
fireworks or grenades.

00:16:02.513 --> 00:16:03.997
Yeah, it can even melt glass.

00:16:04.135 --> 00:16:05.861
Like the skylight
at the museum.

00:16:07.345 --> 00:16:10.486
Wait, you... You think
that I had something
to do with the stolen painting?

00:16:10.624 --> 00:16:14.801
You know, a by-product
of thermite is,
uh, aluminum oxide.

00:16:14.939 --> 00:16:17.528
It's this very fine powder.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:22.498
Yep, that's it.

00:16:22.636 --> 00:16:24.052
You know, I think we should
take this conversation

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.882
down to the precinct, Emilio.
Emilio.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.539
Hey. Hey.

00:16:35.925 --> 00:16:37.030
Move.

00:16:55.635 --> 00:16:58.707
You know, the thing about
stolen vehicles is they
aren't always so reliable.

00:16:59.294 --> 00:17:01.054
Out of the car, sir.
Nice and slow.

00:17:14.447 --> 00:17:16.449
Hey, it's Arthur.
I gotta take this.

00:17:16.587 --> 00:17:19.383
Okay. I'll go brief Wagner.

00:17:24.284 --> 00:17:25.389
Arthur, you okay?

00:17:25.906 --> 00:17:27.494
Well, things could be better.

00:17:27.632 --> 00:17:30.083
- What are you talking about?
- Some guy, he ambushed me.

00:17:30.221 --> 00:17:32.016
<i>He was looking
for Roman's backpack.</i>

00:17:32.154 --> 00:17:33.776
Hold still.

00:17:33.914 --> 00:17:37.194
I got away,
but not before he got
a few hits in on me, you know?

00:17:37.332 --> 00:17:39.230
Oh, my God. How bad is it?

00:17:39.368 --> 00:17:42.406
I got a hard head.
I'll live.

00:17:42.544 --> 00:17:43.924
All right. Where are you?

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.650
<i>- I'm getting patched up
right now.</i>
- Which hospital?

00:17:45.788 --> 00:17:49.551
Hospitals ask too many
questions. I got my own
cut man. Hey, hold on.

00:17:49.689 --> 00:17:51.415
Hey, Harold. Just give me
a second, all right?

00:17:51.553 --> 00:17:53.244
Give me one minute.
Thank you, brother.

00:17:54.452 --> 00:17:57.938
Morgan, listen to me
very carefully, all right?

00:17:58.422 --> 00:18:00.320
These people
are not playing games.

00:18:00.976 --> 00:18:03.427
Whatever's in that backpack
that Roman gave me to pick up,

00:18:03.565 --> 00:18:05.463
they want it,
and they want it real bad.

00:18:07.224 --> 00:18:09.053
Do they know I have it?

00:18:09.191 --> 00:18:10.986
<i>I don't know. If they do,
I damn sure
didn't tell 'em about it.</i>

00:18:11.952 --> 00:18:15.163
Okay, this guy.
Do you think
you could identify him

00:18:15.301 --> 00:18:17.820
and describe him
to a sketch artist?

00:18:18.649 --> 00:18:21.065
We talked about this before.
I am not going to the police.

00:18:21.203 --> 00:18:23.274
Arthur, you just got attacked.

00:18:23.412 --> 00:18:25.345
Who knows when they'll find out
I have Roman's stuff?

00:18:25.966 --> 00:18:27.934
<i>Just tell us where you are.
We can come to you.</i>

00:18:33.284 --> 00:18:34.423
Please.

00:18:36.977 --> 00:18:38.117
Mr. and Mrs. Foster.

00:18:38.255 --> 00:18:39.463
What the hell was that?

00:18:39.601 --> 00:18:41.396
Greg and I saw your captain's
press conference.

00:18:41.534 --> 00:18:43.743
Then you know we're doing
everything we can
to find your stolen painting.

00:18:43.881 --> 00:18:45.814
Are you? Because we were
beginning to wonder

00:18:45.952 --> 00:18:47.712
if you were only interested
in getting your face
on the news.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:51.164
If me standing in front of
a camera can help catch
a murderer and a thief...

00:18:51.302 --> 00:18:54.719
- And what happened
with the ransom note?
- We have a suspect in custody,

00:18:54.857 --> 00:18:57.205
and I assure you we are working
to answer those questions.

00:18:57.343 --> 00:18:59.068
Well, it doesn't seem like
you have much to show for it.

00:18:59.207 --> 00:19:02.141
Mr. and Mrs. Foster,
we know how much
<i>The Young Girl</i> means to you.

00:19:02.693 --> 00:19:04.177
Now I can assure you
that Captain Wagner,

00:19:04.315 --> 00:19:06.041
as well as our entire team
in Major Crimes,

00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:07.525
is doing everything possible
to bring her home.

00:19:07.663 --> 00:19:09.182
Now please let us do our job.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.391
Don't bother.
It's time we hired
our own private detective.

00:19:11.529 --> 00:19:13.807
I think you've kept us waiting
long enough.

00:19:19.537 --> 00:19:22.195
You're not listening to me.
You got the wrong guy.

00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:23.886
No, we wanna
believe you, Emilio,

00:19:24.024 --> 00:19:27.062
but you did try
to get away from us
in a stolen vehicle. Twice.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.720
And then there's what we found
in your apartment.

00:19:29.858 --> 00:19:31.549
Items consistent
with the burglary.

00:19:31.687 --> 00:19:34.863
- That's not mine.
Never seen these before.
- Then why run?

00:19:35.001 --> 00:19:40.213
You see, I think you
started dating Cyrus
to get access to his museum,

00:19:40.351 --> 00:19:43.561
and then you did that whole
<i>Impossible</i> act.

00:19:43.699 --> 00:19:46.357
A theft, a murder, a ransom.

00:19:47.047 --> 00:19:48.394
You had the whole thing
planned out.

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:52.881
My relationship
with Cyrus wasn't perfect,
but I would never hurt him.

00:19:53.019 --> 00:19:54.676
Not even for $20 million?

00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:56.885
Where did you
hide the painting?

00:19:57.023 --> 00:19:58.369
I'm not
hiding anything.

00:19:58.507 --> 00:20:00.406
But you
showed up to the ransom. What?

00:20:00.544 --> 00:20:02.442
Did you get nervous you weren't
gonna be able to find a buyer?

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.858
Because I think you found out
about Rhys through Cyrus,

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:07.861
and Cyrus found out
what you were doing,
and you couldn't have that.

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:11.037
Or maybe he discovered
this wasn't the first
painting you stole.

00:20:14.074 --> 00:20:15.041
I don't understand.

00:20:15.179 --> 00:20:16.663
Oh, I think you do, Emilio.

00:20:16.801 --> 00:20:19.804
Or would you prefer the name,
Jean-Baptiste?

00:20:20.978 --> 00:20:24.568
I only heard
about the stolen painting
because Cyrus told me,

00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:28.123
like... I'm not answering
any more questions.

00:20:29.711 --> 00:20:31.506
Fine, don't say another word.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:35.510
But this court order says
that you need to let us check

00:20:35.648 --> 00:20:37.650
for any identifying marks
on your left shoulder.

00:20:38.616 --> 00:20:40.963
Got this one cutting
an avocado like a jerk.

00:20:41.792 --> 00:20:44.070
Well, I'm glad you survived.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.971
What about you?

00:20:49.109 --> 00:20:50.559
- Scars?
-  Mm-hmm.

00:20:50.697 --> 00:20:54.149
I only have the one.
I'm pretty sure
you've seen it too.

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:57.290
I don't...
I don't think I have.

00:20:57.911 --> 00:21:01.121
Oh, that's hard to believe,
given your powers
of observation.

00:21:03.331 --> 00:21:09.198
Summer 2010,
Florence Art Festival. Things
took a very unpleasant turn.

00:21:09.337 --> 00:21:11.822
I mean, I didn't see the gun,
but I heard the shot.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.720
Luckily for me,
it missed my artery.

00:21:22.453 --> 00:21:23.765
Oh.

00:21:24.973 --> 00:21:27.493
He's got a whole
collection of 'em, doesn't he?

00:21:27.631 --> 00:21:28.977
That he does.

00:21:32.877 --> 00:21:37.330
I served two years in the
Colombian Army. 27th
Jungle Battalion in Putumayo.

00:21:37.468 --> 00:21:38.987
Wait, look at
the side of his hand.

00:21:40.609 --> 00:21:42.473
Yeah, it's all red. Why?
You think he banged it up?

00:21:42.611 --> 00:21:45.718
No, I think it's ink.
Emilio said he was
a language instructor.

00:21:45.856 --> 00:21:47.720
He probably
graded papers with red ink,

00:21:47.858 --> 00:21:49.894
but I didn't see any papers
in the apartments.

00:21:50.032 --> 00:21:53.519
- And what do you do for work?
- I'm a language instructor.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:56.556
Maybe he was doing it
in an office,

00:21:56.694 --> 00:21:58.627
and maybe that office is used
for something

00:21:58.765 --> 00:22:00.008
other than just grading papers.

00:22:00.146 --> 00:22:02.113
Guys, let's go!

00:22:06.704 --> 00:22:08.016
She left.

00:22:16.887 --> 00:22:20.477
Okay, so we're thinking
Emilio might have
had another reason to be here.

00:22:20.615 --> 00:22:22.893
- Like hiding the painting?
- Or the murder weapon.

00:22:23.031 --> 00:22:25.171
- It's a lot of boxes.
- I'll take this room.

00:22:25.723 --> 00:22:26.931
All right, let's get started.

00:22:32.937 --> 00:22:36.113
Teaching languages could've
kept Emilio hopping
from one country to another.

00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:38.943
That would be a good cover
for an international art thief.

00:22:39.081 --> 00:22:41.429
Okay, there's
nothing in here, except for
student paperwork.

00:22:41.567 --> 00:22:43.914
-  Same.
- What do we have here?

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:46.572
- Whoo.
-  Oh, wow.

00:22:47.089 --> 00:22:48.470
I'll call a team
to crack it open.

00:22:55.581 --> 00:22:57.755
-  Uh, guys...
-  Yeah.

00:23:04.866 --> 00:23:06.695
Looks like we found
Jean-Baptiste.

00:23:18.983 --> 00:23:23.436
Good afternoon. I'm
Captain Nick Wagner from the
LAPD's Major Crimes Division.

00:23:24.299 --> 00:23:27.371
Earlier today, our detectives
arrested an individual

00:23:27.509 --> 00:23:31.927
we believe is responsible
for the murder of Cyrus Carrow.

00:23:32.618 --> 00:23:34.758
While our investigation
is not complete,

00:23:34.896 --> 00:23:38.934
<i>we will soon be returning
the stolen Rembrandt
to its rightful owners.</i>

00:23:39.832 --> 00:23:41.109
<i>Are there any questions?</i>

00:23:42.179 --> 00:23:44.664
- Did you inform the Fosters?
- Yep, we left word for them.

00:23:45.251 --> 00:23:47.805
They'll be glad.
There doesn't seem to be
any noticeable damage.

00:23:47.943 --> 00:23:49.220
Hmm.

00:23:49.876 --> 00:23:50.877
Look who's here.

00:23:52.189 --> 00:23:53.570
Detectives.

00:23:53.708 --> 00:23:55.710
Ari, Miriam,
what are you doing here?

00:23:55.848 --> 00:23:59.092
We came to see the painting.
Morgan invited us.

00:24:23.082 --> 00:24:24.117
You Arthur?

00:24:25.843 --> 00:24:27.638
You a cop trying to blend in?

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:29.675
I'm a friend of Morgan's.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.610
Let me just say
what I gotta say so we can
get this thing over with.

00:24:33.748 --> 00:24:34.783
I'm listening.

00:24:36.026 --> 00:24:38.028
There was a dude hiding
in the back of my truck.

00:24:38.787 --> 00:24:40.306
When I didn't give him
what he wanted,

00:24:40.444 --> 00:24:42.757
he reached for a blade,
then we got into it.

00:24:42.895 --> 00:24:44.483
You get a look at the guy?

00:24:44.621 --> 00:24:46.174
Just a couple of glimpses.

00:24:46.312 --> 00:24:49.177
Then we spilled out
into the street.
It all happened pretty fast.

00:24:49.315 --> 00:24:50.592
Any information helps.

00:24:52.111 --> 00:24:53.250
All right.

00:24:53.837 --> 00:24:57.530
White dude, 50s, lean,
salt-and-pepper hair.

00:24:57.668 --> 00:25:00.050
He had, uh,
this big-ass goatee.

00:25:00.188 --> 00:25:03.709
He also had a, uh... a tattoo
of some kind of bird

00:25:03.847 --> 00:25:05.469
peeking out
his shirt right here.

00:25:06.435 --> 00:25:07.782
What are you doing?

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.991
We found pictures of some
people in Roman's backpack.

00:25:10.129 --> 00:25:12.372
One of the guys was somebody
we couldn't identify.

00:25:14.754 --> 00:25:16.031
That the guy?

00:25:20.829 --> 00:25:22.037
Yeah, that's the guy.

00:25:22.659 --> 00:25:24.902
Then I'm gonna need you
to come down
to the precinct with me,

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.248
make an official statement.

00:25:26.973 --> 00:25:30.218
I'm afraid my unofficial
statement is just gonna
have to stand for now. Sorry.

00:25:30.356 --> 00:25:33.980
Your life...
Your life could be in danger.

00:25:34.118 --> 00:25:35.775
What do you want me to do, huh?

00:25:36.258 --> 00:25:38.260
You want me to sit in
your lobby till you catch him?

00:25:38.398 --> 00:25:40.297
Look, just find the guy,
all right?

00:25:40.435 --> 00:25:43.956
Put a couple of your people
on Morgan and her family,
'cause trust me, I'm good.

00:25:45.371 --> 00:25:47.476
We done here? All right.

00:25:47.615 --> 00:25:50.307
I'm giving you my number,
and you're gonna hold on to it.

00:25:50.445 --> 00:25:55.070
And I hope you never
see this guy again,
but the moment you do, call me.

00:25:58.729 --> 00:25:59.730
All right.

00:26:06.944 --> 00:26:08.739
- You invited her?
- Yes, I did.

00:26:09.429 --> 00:26:11.846
You think the Fosters
are going to loan out
that painting anytime soon?

00:26:11.984 --> 00:26:14.573
This will be the last time
Miriam Weisman
will ever be able to see it,

00:26:14.711 --> 00:26:16.298
not to mention the fact
that, technically,

00:26:16.436 --> 00:26:18.473
it belongs to her,
so none of this is fair.

00:26:18.611 --> 00:26:20.786
Well, it's our job to enforce
the law even when it's not.

00:26:20.924 --> 00:26:23.236
Oh, yes,
thank you for the reminder.

00:26:23.374 --> 00:26:26.136
I'm sorry for the quick exit,
but I'm due
in Palermo tomorrow.

00:26:26.274 --> 00:26:29.588
I have another stolen art piece
that requires my services.

00:26:29.726 --> 00:26:30.761
Oh.

00:26:31.417 --> 00:26:33.764
Is she a provocative
young girl this time?

00:26:34.972 --> 00:26:36.008
She's a landscape.

00:26:37.216 --> 00:26:40.288
Well, Rhys, it would seem
that your job here is done.
Thank you.

00:26:40.426 --> 00:26:41.772
- The pleasure's all mine.
- Mm-hmm.

00:26:42.255 --> 00:26:43.671
And for what it's worth,

00:26:44.326 --> 00:26:47.502
I really wish <i>The Young Girl</i>
was being returned
to Miriam Weisman too.

00:26:57.063 --> 00:26:58.340
You all right?

00:26:59.756 --> 00:27:00.964
Yeah.

00:27:02.241 --> 00:27:03.760
That's not her.

00:27:09.593 --> 00:27:10.767
What do you mean?

00:27:11.491 --> 00:27:13.010
She doesn't have my eyes.

00:27:16.082 --> 00:27:20.639
My father always loved
that we had the same eyes.

00:27:27.404 --> 00:27:28.785
I think she's right.

00:27:28.923 --> 00:27:31.822
Karadec, look at the whites
of her eyes. That's too bright.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.171
In 1645, painters used
chalk mixes or lead white

00:27:36.309 --> 00:27:38.104
that had like
a creamy softness to it.

00:27:38.242 --> 00:27:41.660
This is brilliant and glaring,
more like a modern
titanium white,

00:27:41.798 --> 00:27:43.834
which didn't exist
for another three centuries.

00:27:43.972 --> 00:27:47.079
In 1645, no one could've
painted with this brightness
and clarity.

00:27:47.217 --> 00:27:48.563
The materials didn't exist.

00:27:53.188 --> 00:27:55.812
I'm sorry for the quick exit,
but I'm due in
Palermo tomorrow.

00:28:01.783 --> 00:28:03.233
What do you mean it's not her?

00:28:03.371 --> 00:28:04.752
Morgan says the one
we found is a fake.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:06.719
Wouldn't the museum
have authenticated it?

00:28:06.857 --> 00:28:08.548
No, not a small museum
like the Harbogh

00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:10.654
and when it comes
from a reputable
collector like the Fosters.

00:28:10.792 --> 00:28:12.898
So, we're supposed to believe
she knows just by
looking at it?

00:28:13.036 --> 00:28:15.590
Well, there's an authenticator
on the way,
but I believe Morgan.

00:28:16.522 --> 00:28:17.661
Where is she?

00:28:20.215 --> 00:28:21.458
You can take
the next one, right?

00:28:22.355 --> 00:28:23.391
Thanks, Gina.

00:28:24.772 --> 00:28:28.603
Well, I'm not normally one
for prolonged goodbyes,
but in this case--

00:28:28.741 --> 00:28:30.260
- Do you have it?
- I'm sorry, what?

00:28:30.398 --> 00:28:33.228
- Do you have the painting?
- Are you serious?

00:28:33.366 --> 00:28:35.265
You haven't opened
that briefcase once
since you've been here.

00:28:35.403 --> 00:28:36.576
What's inside of it?

00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:38.613
So, that's why you asked me
about my scar.

00:28:39.303 --> 00:28:42.099
Because you think
I'm Jean-Baptiste.
And then I did what?

00:28:42.237 --> 00:28:44.550
Stole the Rembrandt
while no one was looking,

00:28:44.688 --> 00:28:48.002
folded it up and hid it
in my briefcase?

00:28:50.625 --> 00:28:52.523
I can think of one way
we can clear it up.

00:28:52.661 --> 00:28:54.905
They're just confidential
client files in there, Morgan.

00:28:55.043 --> 00:28:56.907
Nothing else, I assure you.

00:28:57.045 --> 00:29:00.186
All right, there's an
unfortunate amount of paperwork
that goes with art recovery.

00:29:00.324 --> 00:29:01.532
I bet, yeah.

00:29:06.123 --> 00:29:07.469
Okay, as you wish.

00:29:20.724 --> 00:29:24.314
I'm sorry,
I really thought the one
we found in Emilio's office

00:29:24.452 --> 00:29:27.489
- was fake and you--
- Stole the real one.
I picked up on that.

00:29:31.908 --> 00:29:33.979
So, you've been playing me
this whole time?

00:29:37.465 --> 00:29:39.191
Was any of this real?

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.435
No.

00:29:43.643 --> 00:29:45.162
It's not real.

00:29:52.307 --> 00:29:54.102
Morgan, what is this?

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.864
We asked Daphne to pull
the Fosters' insurance policy
over the last ten years.

00:29:57.002 --> 00:29:59.142
Now, take a look at what they
were insuring in 2019.

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:01.834
- That's a lot of art.
- Mm-hmm.

00:30:01.972 --> 00:30:03.802
Now look at what they insured
a few years later.

00:30:05.527 --> 00:30:07.598
- Only 12 items.
-  And this year?

00:30:07.736 --> 00:30:09.359
- Just one.
- That's right.

00:30:09.497 --> 00:30:12.845
Now what are the odds
that of all the priceless art
that they own,

00:30:12.983 --> 00:30:16.918
the one piece that gets stolen
is the only one
that happens to be insured?

00:30:17.056 --> 00:30:19.541
I think the art that I saw
at their house was fake.

00:30:22.544 --> 00:30:24.132
Just like the painting
we found,

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:27.446
I tracked down
black market sales
for eight of the pieces listed

00:30:27.584 --> 00:30:29.862
on the Fosters'
2019 insurance rider.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.589
Then we did some more digging.
They're in debt
to some bad people.

00:30:32.727 --> 00:30:34.798
So, you're saying
the Fosters arranged
for their own painting

00:30:34.936 --> 00:30:36.524
to be stolen
for the insurance money?

00:30:36.662 --> 00:30:38.353
They love that painting
so much,

00:30:38.491 --> 00:30:41.184
they weren't willing
to give it up
even when they went broke.

00:30:41.874 --> 00:30:43.876
All right, where is this going?

00:30:44.014 --> 00:30:47.776
One of them must have gotten
an idea. Now I don't know
if it was Greg or Linda.

00:30:47.915 --> 00:30:51.884
Let's arrange to have our
painting stolen and returned
to us without anyone knowing.

00:30:52.022 --> 00:30:55.232
That way, they could keep
both the insurance money
and the painting.

00:30:57.303 --> 00:30:59.409
But why give over
the real thing
if you don't have to?

00:30:59.547 --> 00:31:02.861
Maybe they didn't.
Maybe the Fosters had a forgery
made for the museum.

00:31:02.999 --> 00:31:05.104
Right,
probably by the same expert

00:31:05.242 --> 00:31:06.865
<i>who forged their other ones
on their walls.</i>

00:31:07.003 --> 00:31:08.625
I don't think they'd
want their beloved painting

00:31:08.763 --> 00:31:10.799
getting sliced out of a frame,
do you?

00:31:10.938 --> 00:31:13.216
So, the museum never had
the real painting.
It was all a setup?

00:31:13.354 --> 00:31:15.252
That's right, but nobody
robs a museum for free.

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:17.254
<i>You guys remember the watch?</i>

00:31:17.392 --> 00:31:20.879
<i>I think that Greg and Linda
gave Cyrus the watch
as a down payment.</i>

00:31:21.017 --> 00:31:23.122
And by the time Cyrus realized
the watch was a fake,

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.022
he'd already stolen the
painting, making it look like

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.093
<i>it was Jean-Baptiste
so we wouldn't suspect him.</i>

00:31:28.748 --> 00:31:31.096
<i>What he didn't know was
the painting was fake too.</i>

00:31:31.855 --> 00:31:35.963
<i>He decided he wanted
to double-cross the Fosters
by putting it up for ransom.</i>

00:31:36.101 --> 00:31:38.413
<i>But when the Fosters found out,
they confronted him</i>

00:31:38.897 --> 00:31:40.795
<i>before he could find out
the painting was fake.</i>

00:31:41.589 --> 00:31:44.143
<i>And by that time,
he'd already given
the painting to Emilio,</i>

00:31:44.281 --> 00:31:47.422
<i>who hid it in his office,
believing it was real.</i>

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.149
The Fosters couldn't risk
the truth getting out.

00:31:50.287 --> 00:31:52.911
They needed to keep him quiet,
so they killed Cyrus.

00:31:54.291 --> 00:31:55.361
Again, I'm not sure which one.

00:31:56.362 --> 00:31:57.467
Maybe it was both of them.

00:31:57.605 --> 00:31:59.779
Fake watch?
Are you kidding me? Come on!

00:32:00.504 --> 00:32:02.230
Again, not sure which.

00:32:02.368 --> 00:32:05.268
All right, we need to bring
the Fosters in for questioning.

00:32:09.444 --> 00:32:10.445
They have a yacht.

00:32:13.552 --> 00:32:15.795
The Fosters have a yacht.
I saw a picture of it
at their house.

00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:17.452
It was called the <i>Easy Monet.</i>

00:32:18.281 --> 00:32:19.661
If they go out
to ditch the murder weapon,

00:32:19.799 --> 00:32:21.663
they could try to get away
with murder and the painting.

00:32:21.801 --> 00:32:24.183
Forrester, go grab Ozdil.
Go to their house.

00:32:24.321 --> 00:32:26.806
Karadec, how are your sea legs?

00:32:36.437 --> 00:32:37.817
You know this place?

00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:39.302
Yeah, a friend

Fosters aren't here. Looks like
they left in a hurry.

00:33:55.274 --> 00:33:57.242
- They took everything
of value with them.
-  Mm-hmm.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.038
So, they're making a

00:34:05.802 --> 00:34:07.010

00:34:46.049 --> 00:34:48.051

You could really

00:34:48.189 --> 00:34:49.639
Put it down!

00:34:49.777 --> 00:34:52.297
I wish that I could,
but the LAPD has a few rules,

00:34:52.435 --> 00:34:55.196

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.829

- Just a thief.
- I do recover art

00:36:27.357 --> 00:36:30.222
Hmm. And every once in a while,
you just decide
to hang on to one?

00:36:31.706 --> 00:36:33.294
So, you are Jean-Baptiste?

00:36:33.432 --> 00:36:34.951
You know, I don't even know
who picked that name.

00:36:35.089 --> 00:36:37.056
