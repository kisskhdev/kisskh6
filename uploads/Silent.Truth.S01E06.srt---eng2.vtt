WEBVTT

00:00:04.676 --> 00:00:08.580
{\an8}Your son shoplifted from my store.

00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:10.849
{\an8}We shouldn't let him
manipulate us any further.

00:00:10.915 --> 00:00:12.817
{\an8}What is he demanding?

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:15.587
{\an8}The victim is Hideyuki Sakuma,
40 years old.

00:00:15.653 --> 00:00:18.289
{\an8}The manager of Smile Sakuma
in Mitsuba Minami.

00:00:18.356 --> 00:00:20.291
{\an8}The bullet extracted from the body

00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:23.795
{\an8}was fired from the gun that belonged
to Keisuke's father.

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:26.231
{\an8}I killed my older brother.

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:28.733
{\an8}Mr. Naoto Sakuma just confessed
to the crime.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.235
{\an8}But since you were his classmate,

00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:32.704
{\an8}you will not be allowed
to join the questioning.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.838
{\an8}Please come here.

00:00:35.173 --> 00:00:37.842
{\an8}Please come here right now, Junichi.

00:00:38.343 --> 00:00:41.479
Did he say where he found the gun?

00:00:41.546 --> 00:00:43.615
He said he found it

00:00:44.415 --> 00:00:45.316
in the forest.

00:00:46.818 --> 00:00:49.754
I opened the time capsule,
but there was no gun inside.

00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:52.891
I asked you when you took the gun
from the time capsule.

00:00:52.957 --> 00:00:56.794
The gun that wasn't there on Friday night
was there on Saturday night?

00:00:57.362 --> 00:01:00.131
Did you really dig up that time capsule
on Saturday night?

00:01:01.065 --> 00:01:01.900
I too…

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:08.273
have something I've been shouldering.

00:01:16.214 --> 00:01:17.549
{\an8}Why didn't you

00:01:18.616 --> 00:01:20.585
{\an8}contact Maki after we all graduated?

00:01:21.786 --> 00:01:24.255
{\an8}Isn't it because
you were shouldering something

00:01:25.823 --> 00:01:27.759
{\an8}that you'll never be able to escape from?

00:01:30.128 --> 00:01:31.629
{\an8}It's okay

00:01:34.065 --> 00:01:36.367
{\an8}to be freed from what you did

00:01:36.935 --> 00:01:37.802
{\an8}23 years ago.

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.205
{\an8}What the heck are you talking about?

00:01:41.406 --> 00:01:42.507
{\an8}On that day…

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:45.910
{\an8}I saw it…

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:03.027
I saw you

00:02:04.996 --> 00:02:07.165
shoot someone with a gun.

00:02:20.378 --> 00:02:21.312
Until now

00:02:22.413 --> 00:02:24.349
I've kept it locked away in my heart,

00:02:25.016 --> 00:02:27.018
and it will remain locked away forever.

00:02:29.187 --> 00:02:30.388
I will

00:02:32.924 --> 00:02:34.459
protect you, Junichi.

00:03:06.858 --> 00:03:08.726
Tobina. Hey there.

00:03:12.497 --> 00:03:13.498
Tobina.

00:03:13.564 --> 00:03:14.966
Can we talk a little?

00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:19.671
MITSUBA POLICE STATION

00:03:19.737 --> 00:03:20.805
Come inside.

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:24.809
You must be devastated that Naoto Sakuma
has become a suspect.

00:03:27.445 --> 00:03:29.080
It’s hard on me too.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.484
What?

00:03:36.187 --> 00:03:37.355
The truth is,

00:03:37.422 --> 00:03:39.857
during the incident 23 years ago,

00:03:39.924 --> 00:03:42.026
I was working here,

00:03:42.794 --> 00:03:46.431
and I saw the four of you being helped
by the police.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.336
I wanted the future to be bright

00:03:51.402 --> 00:03:54.005
for the four children who had gone through

00:03:55.106 --> 00:03:57.008
such a shocking experience.

00:03:58.142 --> 00:03:59.944
That was my sincere wish.

00:04:03.648 --> 00:04:07.785
When you appeared in front of me
as a police officer,

00:04:09.887 --> 00:04:11.689
I was really surprised.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:16.761
I'm proud of you

00:04:17.662 --> 00:04:19.430
for becoming a police officer.

00:04:24.702 --> 00:04:27.572
It must be difficult for you to accept
that your classmate

00:04:27.638 --> 00:04:29.374
has committed a crime,

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:32.643
but I hope you will properly fulfill

00:04:33.578 --> 00:04:35.146
your duties as a police officer.

00:04:38.316 --> 00:04:39.150
Yes, sir.

00:04:43.354 --> 00:04:44.489
Good morning.

00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:45.556
Good morning.

00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:48.926
No matter what you order,
we'll split the check.

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:52.363
Okay.

00:05:01.572 --> 00:05:02.507
What brings you here?

00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:06.010
There are several things
that have been bothering me,

00:05:06.077 --> 00:05:08.713
so I figured I’d think about them
in a different setting.

00:05:12.183 --> 00:05:13.384
What's bothering you?

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:15.720
Number one.

00:05:17.088 --> 00:05:19.290
According to Naoto Sakuma's testimony,

00:05:19.357 --> 00:05:21.993
his older brother, Hideyuki,

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:23.861
found the gun in the forest,

00:05:24.562 --> 00:05:27.999
but I can't imagine
how he could have possibly found it there.

00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:32.336
Detective Tobina, can you imagine

00:05:32.837 --> 00:05:37.642
when and in what situation
he picked up Officer Kiyohara's gun?

00:05:37.708 --> 00:05:40.678
I agree, that's difficult to imagine.

00:05:40.745 --> 00:05:41.913
Number two.

00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:46.184
On the day Hideyuki Sakuma was murdered,

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.223
Makiko Iwamoto and Keisuke Kiyohara
reportedly met here at 8:00 p.m.,

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.658
then went separate ways,

00:05:53.724 --> 00:05:56.594
and met again two hours later.

00:05:56.661 --> 00:05:59.130
However, it seems strange that they would

00:05:59.197 --> 00:06:01.432
arrange to meet twice
at this same restaurant.

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:03.134
Please get that for me.

00:06:04.068 --> 00:06:05.203
Sure.

00:06:09.273 --> 00:06:10.541
During those two hours,

00:06:10.608 --> 00:06:13.478
Keisuke Kiyohara checked into his hotel,

00:06:13.544 --> 00:06:16.681
and Makiko Iwamoto returned
to the hair salon.

00:06:17.648 --> 00:06:21.586
We have confirmed that Keisuke Kiyohara
checked into the hotel, right?

00:06:21.652 --> 00:06:22.487
Yes.

00:06:23.387 --> 00:06:24.889
Regarding Makiko Iwamoto,

00:06:24.956 --> 00:06:26.224
there were two witnesses

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.993
stating that the lights were on
at the salon and they saw a figure inside.

00:06:29.494 --> 00:06:31.195
A figure inside, huh?

00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:34.332
Yes.

00:06:34.398 --> 00:06:35.666
Number three.

00:06:38.035 --> 00:06:39.136
We'll talk about that

00:06:40.037 --> 00:06:42.773
when I get everyone together again.

00:06:53.284 --> 00:06:55.319
Detective Ayanokoji,
would you like some too?

00:06:56.554 --> 00:06:58.055
Ayanokoji…

00:06:58.756 --> 00:07:00.992
Are you doing it on purpose?

00:07:01.726 --> 00:07:02.960
But I don't mind.

00:07:03.027 --> 00:07:04.962
I actually kind of like it.

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:06.030
It’s ripe.

00:07:07.198 --> 00:07:09.667
Yes. I, Nagai, will gladly accept.

00:07:10.601 --> 00:07:11.502
Did you know

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:13.437
if you peel it into three sections
you're a monkey?

00:07:13.504 --> 00:07:16.974
But if you peel it into four sections,
you're a human!

00:07:17.041 --> 00:07:17.909
Just kidding!

00:07:19.844 --> 00:07:21.112
It's pretty darn good.

00:07:21.612 --> 00:07:22.880
Delicious.

00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:25.082
What?

00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:36.160
MIHO

00:07:37.128 --> 00:07:38.062
Hello?

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:38.963
Manager.

00:07:40.364 --> 00:07:41.899
I'm so sorry!

00:07:41.966 --> 00:07:44.101
What's the matter?

00:07:44.168 --> 00:07:45.169
I…

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:49.941
sometimes use the salon at night
without your permission.

00:07:50.641 --> 00:07:52.009
What do you mean?

00:07:53.444 --> 00:07:54.278
At night,

00:07:55.212 --> 00:07:57.882
I sometimes cut and dye
my boyfriend's hair.

00:08:00.785 --> 00:08:01.986
I see.

00:08:02.053 --> 00:08:03.921
I was using it again today

00:08:04.989 --> 00:08:06.557
and when I was about to leave,

00:08:07.592 --> 00:08:09.460
the police came.

00:08:10.027 --> 00:08:10.828
What?

00:08:11.395 --> 00:08:13.965
The police asked me
when I was at the salon at night,

00:08:15.099 --> 00:08:16.500
and I told them.

00:08:19.637 --> 00:08:20.471
Hey…

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.575
When was the last time you used it?

00:08:25.543 --> 00:08:27.912
Saturday, the 17th.

00:08:30.548 --> 00:08:32.283
I'm really sorry!

00:08:37.688 --> 00:08:39.090
It's all right.

00:08:39.156 --> 00:08:40.257
Sorry.

00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:42.827
Bye.

00:09:29.907 --> 00:09:31.575
Sorry, did I wake you?

00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:38.849
Junichi.

00:09:45.856 --> 00:09:47.024
It's decaf.

00:09:51.262 --> 00:09:52.430
Thanks.

00:10:06.177 --> 00:10:07.445
Hiromi,

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.083
why did you decide to become a nurse?

00:10:12.149 --> 00:10:12.983
What?

00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:16.887
I just thought it was an unusual question.

00:10:17.822 --> 00:10:20.091
Since it involves
matters of life and death,

00:10:22.093 --> 00:10:24.295
I wondered if it was your wish
to help people.

00:10:28.232 --> 00:10:29.400
You know…

00:10:29.467 --> 00:10:30.301
Yeah?

00:10:32.403 --> 00:10:35.439
I've never felt any desire to help

00:10:36.107 --> 00:10:39.310
or to empathize with my patients at all.

00:10:39.376 --> 00:10:40.411
What?

00:10:40.478 --> 00:10:42.546
But I'm

00:10:43.447 --> 00:10:45.683
friendly enough,

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.153
so I'm often mistaken for
a nurse who cares for her patients.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.888
It's not true?

00:10:51.589 --> 00:10:53.023
Yeah.

00:10:53.891 --> 00:10:54.959
What about you, Junichi?

00:10:55.025 --> 00:10:57.228
Why did you become a police officer?

00:11:02.433 --> 00:11:04.268
I shouldn't have become one.

00:11:05.136 --> 00:11:06.370
Why?

00:11:07.905 --> 00:11:09.740
Because I've committed a crime.

00:11:12.476 --> 00:11:13.511
Like what?

00:11:18.015 --> 00:11:19.016
What do you think?

00:11:24.155 --> 00:11:25.656
Did you eat all the Alaskan pink shrimp

00:11:26.423 --> 00:11:28.392
at a sushi restaurant?

00:11:32.696 --> 00:11:34.265
- Oh, I know.
- Okay.

00:11:35.566 --> 00:11:37.168
A girl did everything

00:11:38.169 --> 00:11:42.139
to express her feelings for you,
but you pretended not to notice.

00:11:42.206 --> 00:11:44.642
- I think I'm guilty of doing that.
- I knew it.

00:11:44.708 --> 00:11:47.211
Also, I ate the leftover flan
from the school lunch even though

00:11:47.278 --> 00:11:49.213
we were supposed to win it
by playing a game.

00:11:49.713 --> 00:11:51.715
I can totally picture that in my head.

00:11:55.186 --> 00:11:56.987
In the second year of high school…

00:11:57.054 --> 00:11:57.888
Yeah?

00:11:58.722 --> 00:12:02.092
I happened to see a poster
for the police officer recruitment exam.

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:05.129
You just happened to see it?
And so you became a police officer?

00:12:05.196 --> 00:12:06.330
You know,

00:12:07.865 --> 00:12:09.667
my father died when I was in kindergarten.

00:12:12.336 --> 00:12:14.505
I didn't have much money,

00:12:15.472 --> 00:12:17.808
so I worked at a car repair shop
during the day

00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:19.844
and took high school classes at night.

00:12:20.344 --> 00:12:22.913
I saw that poster
on the school bulletin board,

00:12:25.182 --> 00:12:26.984
and thought that being a civil servant

00:12:28.185 --> 00:12:29.787
would be a nice, stable job.

00:12:35.159 --> 00:12:36.260
But, you know,

00:12:37.828 --> 00:12:39.496
when I was in elementary school,

00:12:40.664 --> 00:12:43.067
I had a friend whose dad
played catch with me,

00:12:43.133 --> 00:12:45.636
and taught me kendo.

00:12:46.637 --> 00:12:48.105
I was really attached to him,

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.642
and I called him "Pops."

00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:55.079
That person was a police officer.

00:12:55.713 --> 00:12:56.614
Wow.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:04.021
Does Pops know

00:13:04.555 --> 00:13:07.124
that you became a police officer?

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.494
No.

00:13:13.163 --> 00:13:14.732
Pops

00:13:16.066 --> 00:13:18.502
was killed by a robber when I was in

00:13:20.504 --> 00:13:22.406
the sixth grade of elementary school,

00:13:25.342 --> 00:13:27.611
and I was the first person
to discover his body.

00:13:33.083 --> 00:13:35.853
Maybe it's not just by chance
that you became a police officer.

00:13:41.325 --> 00:13:42.159
Right?

00:13:43.193 --> 00:13:44.662
Yeah.

00:13:50.467 --> 00:13:53.270
MAKIKO IWAMOTO

00:13:54.038 --> 00:13:54.905
Hello?

00:13:58.676 --> 00:14:00.411
Sorry to call at this hour.

00:14:02.579 --> 00:14:03.480
What's the matter?

00:14:15.326 --> 00:14:17.328
Good morning, Ms. Iwamoto.

00:14:17.394 --> 00:14:18.829
Good morning.

00:14:18.896 --> 00:14:20.331
I have something I'd like to ask you.

00:14:20.397 --> 00:14:22.199
Would you mind coming
to the police station?

00:14:24.234 --> 00:14:25.736
You want me to come voluntarily?

00:14:25.803 --> 00:14:26.637
Yes.

00:14:28.739 --> 00:14:29.773
Then I decline.

00:14:30.407 --> 00:14:31.408
What?

00:14:31.909 --> 00:14:33.143
I have work to attend to.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.378
You're going to evade us?

00:14:37.314 --> 00:14:38.549
Excuse me.

00:14:53.964 --> 00:14:54.898
Wow.

00:15:02.506 --> 00:15:03.907
I asked her to leave.

00:15:18.722 --> 00:15:20.557
Thank you for coming.

00:15:22.593 --> 00:15:23.427
But

00:15:24.461 --> 00:15:25.396
I'm sorry.

00:15:27.297 --> 00:15:28.232
I can't

00:15:29.033 --> 00:15:30.334
tell you anything right now.

00:15:31.502 --> 00:15:32.336
Not even to me?

00:15:35.105 --> 00:15:36.707
Sorry. I can't right now.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.211
Okay.

00:16:00.731 --> 00:16:01.565
Hey.

00:16:04.601 --> 00:16:05.736
Junichi,

00:16:08.305 --> 00:16:09.907
can you talk about it now?

00:16:12.843 --> 00:16:13.777
About what?

00:16:18.916 --> 00:16:20.951
Right after you graduated,

00:16:22.052 --> 00:16:24.455
you moved to Yokohama.

00:16:25.289 --> 00:16:26.123
Yeah.

00:16:27.424 --> 00:16:28.759
When I told you

00:16:29.827 --> 00:16:32.129
that I'd come to see you off
on your last day,

00:16:32.896 --> 00:16:35.699
you said, "Don't you dare come."
Do you remember that?

00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:42.072
Since you said, "Don't you dare come,"

00:16:42.573 --> 00:16:45.209
I asked you to keep in touch,

00:16:46.176 --> 00:16:47.811
and you said you wouldn't.

00:16:52.683 --> 00:16:54.017
Why was that?

00:16:56.687 --> 00:16:57.955
Did I say that?

00:16:58.522 --> 00:17:00.390
You don't remember?

00:17:00.457 --> 00:17:01.291
Yeah.

00:17:03.026 --> 00:17:06.396
Back then,
I thought I was going to marry you,

00:17:06.463 --> 00:17:08.365
so it was a huge shock to me.

00:17:18.842 --> 00:17:21.311
But you got mad at me for kissing you?

00:17:22.779 --> 00:17:24.715
Well, that's because…

00:17:28.252 --> 00:17:30.587
that was not the right place
or the right time.

00:17:39.196 --> 00:17:40.264
Thank you.

00:17:43.667 --> 00:17:44.935
I promise

00:17:45.903 --> 00:17:47.704
I won't cause you any trouble.

00:17:55.512 --> 00:17:57.181
I guess I already am.

00:18:08.992 --> 00:18:09.826
I'll be off.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:14.464
Bye.

00:18:51.034 --> 00:18:52.469
It's tomorrow at ten, right?

00:18:54.037 --> 00:18:55.572
Don't come to see me off.

00:18:56.807 --> 00:18:57.741
Why?

00:18:57.808 --> 00:18:59.009
You don't have to come.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.081
Because you'll cry?

00:19:04.147 --> 00:19:05.115
No way.

00:19:07.818 --> 00:19:09.219
Keep in touch even after you move.

00:19:09.286 --> 00:19:10.420
I won't.

00:19:11.622 --> 00:19:13.457
- Why?
- Just shut up.

00:19:15.425 --> 00:19:16.760
I won't see you ever again.

00:19:51.128 --> 00:19:52.329
Ms. Nara,

00:19:52.396 --> 00:19:54.698
I've never had anyone refuse
voluntary accompaniment.

00:19:54.765 --> 00:19:55.732
Seriously.

00:19:56.767 --> 00:19:58.468
Let's tell Naoto Sakuma that her alibi

00:19:58.535 --> 00:20:00.604
has fallen apart and see how he reacts.

00:20:02.339 --> 00:20:04.474
That's a no, huh? Sorry.

00:20:05.876 --> 00:20:09.246
I wonder if we'll ever find the gun.

00:20:09.313 --> 00:20:11.415
The gun that Naoto Sakuma
threw into the river?

00:20:13.116 --> 00:20:14.818
I wonder…

00:20:14.885 --> 00:20:16.853
Mr. Tobina! We have crazy news.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.956
Makiko Iwamoto
declined to accompany us voluntarily.

00:20:20.524 --> 00:20:21.525
Isn't that crazy?

00:20:22.025 --> 00:20:23.226
It's crazy, right?

00:20:23.293 --> 00:20:25.629
I never even imagined she'd decline.

00:20:25.696 --> 00:20:28.031
I didn't know you could
decline voluntary accompaniment.

00:20:28.098 --> 00:20:30.634
- Detective Tobina.
- Yes?

00:20:31.201 --> 00:20:33.804
I told you that something
has been bothering me, right?

00:20:34.304 --> 00:20:36.340
The one you'll tell us
when everyone is together?

00:20:36.406 --> 00:20:37.274
Everyone?

00:20:37.341 --> 00:20:38.175
Yes.

00:20:38.675 --> 00:20:40.711
Let's all go find the gun together.

00:20:40.777 --> 00:20:42.012
Together?

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:44.414
The key to solving this case is that gun.

00:20:44.481 --> 00:20:45.549
The key?

00:20:46.049 --> 00:20:49.353
However, this will be done secretly
by Detective Tobina and me,

00:20:49.419 --> 00:20:51.788
without the Special Investigation
Headquarters.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:55.926
The buddy cop returns!

00:21:06.937 --> 00:21:08.972
The search in the river is continuing,

00:21:09.539 --> 00:21:13.377
but everyone is predicting
that the gun won't be found.

00:21:14.344 --> 00:21:15.579
I see.

00:21:16.079 --> 00:21:17.080
It seems

00:21:17.147 --> 00:21:20.817
the prefectural police are trying to close
the case by identifying

00:21:21.785 --> 00:21:23.920
Naoto Sakuma as the culprit,
while withholding

00:21:24.421 --> 00:21:26.957
that the gun involved
was a police-issued firearm.

00:21:29.926 --> 00:21:31.561
I understand.

00:21:32.095 --> 00:21:35.265
I will go along with that narrative.

00:21:43.173 --> 00:21:45.942
I wonder where that gun went.

00:21:53.216 --> 00:21:55.685
Mr. Kiyohara and Ms. Iwamoto,

00:21:55.752 --> 00:21:58.889
thank you so much
for coming all the way here.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.392
I asked you all to gather here

00:22:02.459 --> 00:22:04.227
because I want to re-examine

00:22:04.294 --> 00:22:06.596
the incident that happened 23 years ago.

00:22:07.998 --> 00:22:09.800
As I mentioned before,

00:22:09.866 --> 00:22:11.668
a long time has passed since then.

00:22:11.735 --> 00:22:13.036
My memory is vague.

00:22:13.103 --> 00:22:15.238
It'll be difficult
to help re-examine anything.

00:22:15.305 --> 00:22:17.908
You're absolutely right, Mr. Kiyohara.

00:22:18.575 --> 00:22:22.179
Memory is something that can change.

00:22:22.779 --> 00:22:24.047
Nevertheless,

00:22:24.114 --> 00:22:26.082
I don't think it's a waste of time

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.052
for you all,
who were children at the time,

00:22:29.119 --> 00:22:31.588
to re-examine the situation now as adults.

00:22:32.355 --> 00:22:36.259
Coming to this place
might bring back some memories.

00:22:36.326 --> 00:22:38.995
There are things I don't want to remember.

00:22:39.062 --> 00:22:39.896
Yes.

00:22:41.298 --> 00:22:44.067
I understand this will bring back
painful memories.

00:22:44.568 --> 00:22:45.569
However,

00:22:46.136 --> 00:22:49.439
this concerns your father's gun.

00:22:49.506 --> 00:22:51.975
We would appreciate your cooperation.

00:22:53.076 --> 00:22:56.213
Now, if you remember
where you guys entered from,

00:22:56.279 --> 00:22:58.415
please tell me.

00:22:59.316 --> 00:23:00.317
This way.

00:23:02.552 --> 00:23:03.553
Let's go.

00:23:40.357 --> 00:23:41.525
Naoto!

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.362
I'll go look for Naoto.

00:23:45.428 --> 00:23:46.663
Okay.

00:23:49.633 --> 00:23:50.901
Naoto!

00:24:05.815 --> 00:24:08.418
{\an8}CAUTION
BEYOND THIS POINT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS

00:24:08.485 --> 00:24:11.087
{\an8}PLEASE REFRAIN FROM ENTERING
UNLESS YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO DO SO

00:24:27.804 --> 00:24:29.139
{\an8}BEWARE OF FALLING ROCKS

00:24:29.205 --> 00:24:30.574
{\an8}NO TRESPASSING

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.368
You shouldn't go.

00:24:59.002 --> 00:25:00.070
Don't go there.

00:25:01.237 --> 00:25:02.072
Don't go.

00:25:17.754 --> 00:25:21.424
{\an8}BEWARE OF FALLING ROCKS

00:25:57.694 --> 00:26:00.830
This is where we found
Officer Kiyohara's body.

00:26:02.432 --> 00:26:06.136
Exactly where was Officer Kiyohara's body
when you found him?

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:08.605
Over there.

00:26:10.306 --> 00:26:13.309
Where was the body of Oshima,
the perpetrator?

00:26:19.015 --> 00:26:20.016
Over there.

00:26:30.427 --> 00:26:32.529
According to the investigation reports,

00:26:32.595 --> 00:26:38.535
the four of you went into the forest
to catch freshwater crabs in the creek.

00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:41.304
You guys heard several gunshots

00:26:42.105 --> 00:26:44.407
and got scared, so you tried to run away.

00:26:45.208 --> 00:26:48.945
While running away, all of you discovered
the body of Officer Kiyohara,

00:26:49.012 --> 00:26:51.414
and immediately tried to leave the forest.

00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:54.417
Is that correct?

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:58.888
That's correct.

00:26:58.955 --> 00:27:02.258
Mr. Keisuke Kiyohara, is that correct?

00:27:03.393 --> 00:27:04.227
Yes.

00:27:05.428 --> 00:27:07.097
And you, Mr. Naoto Sakuma?

00:27:08.331 --> 00:27:09.499
That's correct.

00:27:09.566 --> 00:27:11.234
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto?

00:27:11.735 --> 00:27:13.636
That's correct.

00:27:19.609 --> 00:27:22.245
What I just mentioned
are the only things recorded

00:27:23.146 --> 00:27:24.547
in the investigation reports.

00:27:25.248 --> 00:27:27.083
Even though it was such a major incident,

00:27:27.951 --> 00:27:31.921
and you four
were the first to discover the body,

00:27:31.988 --> 00:27:34.224
the report was far too concise,

00:27:35.058 --> 00:27:37.994
or in other words, poorly written.

00:27:38.728 --> 00:27:43.933
Therefore, I'd like
to re-examine it again in more detail.

00:27:45.435 --> 00:27:50.940
Let's start with the location
where you all heard the gunshots.

00:27:51.574 --> 00:27:56.813
{\an8}Let's start with the location
where you all heard the gunshots.

00:27:57.614 --> 00:28:00.717
Where did you hear the first gunshot?

00:28:02.852 --> 00:28:05.522
I believe the road
was split into two back there,

00:28:06.222 --> 00:28:07.290
but Makiko…

00:28:09.526 --> 00:28:12.262
- Ms. Iwamoto and I--
- Just call her how you usually do.

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:14.798
Makiko and I

00:28:15.365 --> 00:28:17.534
took the road to the right
and heard the gunshot.

00:28:18.968 --> 00:28:22.405
So, the four of you weren't together
the whole time?

00:28:23.506 --> 00:28:24.340
Correct.

00:28:24.941 --> 00:28:28.044
We split into two groups
and planned to meet up at the river.

00:28:28.611 --> 00:28:31.247
So then Mr. Kiyohara
and Mr. Sakuma were together?

00:28:32.015 --> 00:28:32.849
Yes.

00:28:33.983 --> 00:28:38.488
Then Mr. Kiyohara,
where did you hear the gunshot?

00:28:41.591 --> 00:28:42.926
Naoto and I

00:28:42.992 --> 00:28:45.929
heard it while walking
on the path we were just on.

00:28:47.831 --> 00:28:49.499
We first heard one gunshot.

00:28:57.207 --> 00:28:58.474
Then after that,

00:28:59.008 --> 00:29:00.877
we heard two more gunshots.

00:29:01.611 --> 00:29:04.414
Then, we immediately returned
the way we came.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.481
{\an8}NO TRESPASSING

00:29:08.284 --> 00:29:10.119
Keisuke, what's wrong?

00:29:10.186 --> 00:29:12.188
When I met up with Junichi and Makiko

00:29:12.255 --> 00:29:14.457
at the fork in the road,

00:29:14.524 --> 00:29:16.259
we heard one more gunshot.

00:29:16.826 --> 00:29:17.894
Where's Naoto?

00:29:17.961 --> 00:29:19.662
What? He's right behind me.

00:29:20.163 --> 00:29:21.731
- Where's Naoto?
- What?

00:29:21.798 --> 00:29:22.932
{\an8}NO TRESPASSING

00:29:23.499 --> 00:29:26.369
So you heard four gunshots
up to that point.

00:29:26.936 --> 00:29:27.937
Yes.

00:29:28.004 --> 00:29:29.005
Then what happened?

00:29:30.306 --> 00:29:33.076
I thought Naoto was behind me,
but he wasn't,

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:36.312
so Junichi went to look for him.

00:29:38.147 --> 00:29:39.182
As Makiko and I

00:29:40.083 --> 00:29:42.952
were leaving the forest
to call the police,

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.188
we heard another gunshot.

00:29:49.392 --> 00:29:51.427
That was the last gunshot I heard.

00:29:51.995 --> 00:29:56.032
So there were five gunshots in total.

00:29:56.099 --> 00:29:56.933
Yes.

00:29:57.433 --> 00:29:58.301
Then what happened?

00:29:58.868 --> 00:30:01.004
I was worried about Junichi and Naoto,

00:30:01.504 --> 00:30:03.239
so instead of leaving the forest,

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.208
Makiko and I went back.

00:30:07.777 --> 00:30:09.579
We first found Naoto.

00:30:11.748 --> 00:30:13.850
I was about to go in the direction
Junichi had gone,

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.419
when he came back.

00:30:18.121 --> 00:30:20.123
I could tell something was wrong
with Junichi,

00:30:22.558 --> 00:30:24.427
so I wondered what had happened,

00:30:27.797 --> 00:30:28.998
and went to go see…

00:30:29.999 --> 00:30:32.368
You found Officer Kiyohara's body.

00:30:33.102 --> 00:30:34.504
Correct?

00:30:35.805 --> 00:30:36.639
Yes.

00:30:37.907 --> 00:30:39.208
Thank you.

00:30:40.109 --> 00:30:42.779
What do you remember, Ms. Iwamoto?

00:30:45.915 --> 00:30:46.950
It's just as he mentioned.

00:30:49.218 --> 00:30:50.186
Mr. Sakuma?

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:56.859
What do you remember, Mr. Sakuma?

00:30:59.662 --> 00:31:02.999
I was so scared I couldn't even move.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.569
I don't even remember where or how many
shots there were.

00:31:08.004 --> 00:31:08.871
And then?

00:31:11.007 --> 00:31:12.141
All four of us

00:31:13.376 --> 00:31:14.944
went towards the sound of the gunshot…

00:31:15.011 --> 00:31:16.646
I saw it…

00:31:17.213 --> 00:31:18.448
…and found Keisuke's father.

00:31:19.415 --> 00:31:20.616
Thank you.

00:31:22.518 --> 00:31:25.154
Now, Detective Tobina…

00:31:27.323 --> 00:31:28.858
Detective Tobina!

00:31:28.925 --> 00:31:31.361
Tell us where you heard the shots
and how many you heard.

00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:36.366
Makiko and I took the path to the right.

00:31:39.068 --> 00:31:39.969
First, we heard one shot.

00:31:41.037 --> 00:31:42.872
Then we heard two more gunshots.

00:31:44.507 --> 00:31:46.075
We returned to the fork in the road,

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:49.479
and when we reunited with Keisuke,
we heard one more shot.

00:31:49.545 --> 00:31:50.780
Then,

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.916
you went down the left path
to look for Mr. Sakuma.

00:31:54.517 --> 00:31:56.085
Is that correct?

00:31:57.587 --> 00:31:58.421
Yes.

00:31:58.921 --> 00:32:00.990
After finding Mr. Sakuma,

00:32:01.691 --> 00:32:03.459
you went further down the path all alone.

00:32:06.229 --> 00:32:07.063
Yes.

00:32:10.867 --> 00:32:11.834
Then

00:32:14.037 --> 00:32:15.838
I heard another gunshot.

00:32:22.245 --> 00:32:23.212
Then what happened?

00:32:24.414 --> 00:32:25.882
I hid behind a tree

00:32:26.516 --> 00:32:28.051
and peeked out from there,

00:32:29.419 --> 00:32:30.720
and saw something blue…

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.925
I went further ahead,

00:32:38.361 --> 00:32:40.530
and realized it was Officer Kiyohara.

00:32:41.597 --> 00:32:42.799
In other words,

00:32:42.865 --> 00:32:48.237
you were the first one to discover
Officer Kiyohara's body?

00:32:48.738 --> 00:32:50.907
- Yes.
- Please continue.

00:32:52.475 --> 00:32:54.210
When I went back to Naoto,

00:32:56.646 --> 00:32:58.381
Keisuke and Makiko were there.

00:33:00.283 --> 00:33:01.117
That's when

00:33:01.918 --> 00:33:06.189
all four of you found out
about Officer Kiyohara, correct?

00:33:07.457 --> 00:33:08.291
Yes.

00:33:12.495 --> 00:33:13.629
I see.

00:33:18.768 --> 00:33:20.570
I have two handkerchiefs here.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:22.338
Please place one

00:33:22.839 --> 00:33:25.575
at the location where Officer Kiyohara
was found lying down.

00:33:28.611 --> 00:33:30.146
The other will be placed

00:33:31.214 --> 00:33:34.517
at the location where Nobukazu Oshima
was found lying down.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.489
According to the investigation reports,

00:33:39.989 --> 00:33:42.391
Officer Kiyohara
was found lying on his back

00:33:42.458 --> 00:33:44.961
with a gunshot wound to the heart.

00:33:45.628 --> 00:33:48.464
The gun Oshima was holding
when he was found on the ground,

00:33:48.531 --> 00:33:49.932
was a modified gun.

00:33:51.734 --> 00:33:53.169
Please imagine this.

00:33:54.237 --> 00:33:57.673
When Officer Kiyohara
found the culprit in the forest,

00:33:58.407 --> 00:34:01.043
he did what any police officer would do,

00:34:01.777 --> 00:34:05.314
and first gave a verbal command
for the suspect to stop.

00:34:05.381 --> 00:34:07.483
Detective Tobina, please reenact it.

00:34:22.365 --> 00:34:23.232
Freeze.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.535
Freeze!

00:34:29.505 --> 00:34:30.473
However,

00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:32.909
Oshima did not stop.

00:34:33.476 --> 00:34:37.280
On the contrary, he fired his gun
at Officer Kiyohara.

00:34:38.714 --> 00:34:39.549
Bang.

00:34:40.983 --> 00:34:42.318
In response,

00:34:42.385 --> 00:34:46.489
Officer Kiyohara fired
a second warning shot.

00:34:46.556 --> 00:34:48.324
Drop your gun!

00:34:51.861 --> 00:34:55.131
Since no bullet casings were found
near the scene,

00:34:55.197 --> 00:34:58.467
it can be concluded that the shots
were not fired with Oshima as the target.

00:34:59.635 --> 00:35:00.703
However,

00:35:02.038 --> 00:35:05.908
it seems that Officer Kiyohara's decision
backfired.

00:35:07.076 --> 00:35:08.110
Undeterred

00:35:08.611 --> 00:35:11.214
by the warning shot,

00:35:12.648 --> 00:35:18.154
Oshima used the modified gun
to fire at Officer Kiyohara.

00:35:19.722 --> 00:35:20.690
And that bullet

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:23.859
hit Officer Kiyohara.

00:35:25.428 --> 00:35:27.430
That caused him to fall to the ground.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.401
Hold on a second.

00:35:33.703 --> 00:35:34.537
My father

00:35:35.037 --> 00:35:38.140
shot Oshima before he fell down,
didn't he?

00:35:38.207 --> 00:35:39.709
That's impossible.

00:35:42.211 --> 00:35:44.247
If someone were shot at this distance,

00:35:44.313 --> 00:35:47.083
most people wouldn't be able
to remain standing.

00:35:48.718 --> 00:35:49.719
Then

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.955
did my father shoot him
after he had fallen down?

00:35:53.022 --> 00:35:54.523
Using all his remaining strength?

00:35:55.024 --> 00:35:56.826
He was shot in the heart.

00:35:57.326 --> 00:35:59.962
It is believed that he collapsed
and died instantly.

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:01.464
What?

00:36:04.634 --> 00:36:05.468
What…

00:36:06.569 --> 00:36:10.172
So, does that mean someone else
shot Oshima?

00:36:11.274 --> 00:36:12.875
That's the only reasonable conclusion.

00:36:17.647 --> 00:36:20.650
Then could it be the accomplice?

00:36:21.417 --> 00:36:25.521
Did the accomplice shoot Oshima to keep
the 30 million yen?

00:36:26.022 --> 00:36:27.957
That's one possibility.

00:36:28.024 --> 00:36:30.493
What other possibilities are there?

00:36:32.928 --> 00:36:35.164
When you all arrived at the scene,

00:36:35.698 --> 00:36:39.735
Officer Kiyohara's gun
was already missing.

00:36:40.736 --> 00:36:41.904
That's correct, isn't it?

00:36:43.172 --> 00:36:44.106
Yes.

00:36:44.173 --> 00:36:45.374
It was not there.

00:36:47.276 --> 00:36:48.444
Let's assume

00:36:48.944 --> 00:36:53.516
that the accomplice
ran off with Officer Kiyohara's gun.

00:36:54.383 --> 00:36:56.319
What would be the reason for that?

00:36:56.385 --> 00:36:58.254
The only thing I can think of
is fingerprints.

00:36:59.655 --> 00:37:01.624
If there was an accomplice

00:37:01.691 --> 00:37:04.894
and that person killed Oshima
with Officer Kiyohara's gun,

00:37:06.662 --> 00:37:09.665
the accomplice's fingerprints
would be left on the gun.

00:37:13.502 --> 00:37:16.105
Maybe the accomplice took the gun
for that reason?

00:37:16.172 --> 00:37:17.273
I see.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.342
It makes sense logically.

00:37:20.009 --> 00:37:21.077
But I'm sure

00:37:21.777 --> 00:37:24.513
the accomplice was prepared
not to leave fingerprints behind.

00:37:26.048 --> 00:37:28.284
When I checked the photos in the reports,

00:37:28.351 --> 00:37:31.654
Oshima was wearing gloves on both hands.

00:37:32.154 --> 00:37:33.589
If he had an accomplice,

00:37:33.656 --> 00:37:37.226
that person
must have also had gloves on too.

00:37:38.561 --> 00:37:41.430
The reason why
the accomplice took the gun…

00:37:42.064 --> 00:37:44.166
The more I think about it,

00:37:44.233 --> 00:37:46.402
the more I don't understand.

00:37:47.903 --> 00:37:50.706
Officer Kiyohara's gun is,

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.477
of course, the standard issue gun
of the Japanese police.

00:37:55.478 --> 00:37:58.481
Even if someone were to steal it,
they wouldn't be able to use it again.

00:37:58.547 --> 00:38:00.950
Since it can be identified immediately.

00:38:02.385 --> 00:38:05.888
It was a gun that was pointless
to make off with.

00:38:06.389 --> 00:38:08.724
So I started to think…

00:38:09.625 --> 00:38:15.364
Maybe the accomplice didn't actually
make off with the gun?

00:38:16.565 --> 00:38:17.700
In other words,

00:38:18.634 --> 00:38:21.370
maybe the gun was still on the ground

00:38:21.971 --> 00:38:24.907
near Officer Kiyohara's body?

00:38:27.076 --> 00:38:28.110
The question is,

00:38:29.445 --> 00:38:31.547
who shot Oshima?

00:38:32.615 --> 00:38:33.716
That's the real mystery.

00:38:37.319 --> 00:38:39.121
Officer Kiyohara

00:38:39.889 --> 00:38:41.557
was shot by Oshima

00:38:41.624 --> 00:38:43.526
and died on the spot.

00:38:45.161 --> 00:38:46.395
When he was shot,

00:38:47.663 --> 00:38:51.066
he dropped the gun he was holding.

00:38:52.568 --> 00:38:55.838
The person who picked it up shot Oshima.

00:38:58.174 --> 00:38:59.341
So…

00:39:00.342 --> 00:39:02.445
who shot Oshima?

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:06.515
In this situation,

00:39:07.249 --> 00:39:09.652
it narrows down the pool of suspects.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.521
For example,

00:39:14.757 --> 00:39:17.393
the first person
to arrive at this location.

00:39:24.233 --> 00:39:25.201
Detective,

00:39:25.701 --> 00:39:28.704
are you trying to say
that Junichi shot him?

00:39:30.606 --> 00:39:32.074
That's impossible.

00:39:32.141 --> 00:39:33.709
We were just elementary school students.

00:39:34.276 --> 00:39:36.712
There's no way we could have fired a gun.

00:39:38.447 --> 00:39:39.815
My father,

00:39:40.683 --> 00:39:42.084
Officer Kiyohara,

00:39:43.052 --> 00:39:45.521
was involved in a shootout with Oshima.

00:39:57.399 --> 00:39:58.234
Junichi?

00:40:07.977 --> 00:40:09.278
Keisuke, you should go with her.

00:40:09.979 --> 00:40:10.813
What?

00:40:11.714 --> 00:40:12.882
Take care of Makiko.

00:40:13.949 --> 00:40:14.950
Okay.

00:40:17.786 --> 00:40:18.787
Naoto!

00:40:24.126 --> 00:40:25.294
I'll go check things out.

00:40:26.529 --> 00:40:27.663
You stay here.

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:28.998
No, I'll go with you.

00:40:30.232 --> 00:40:31.233
Don't overdo it.

00:41:03.165 --> 00:41:04.133
Pops.

00:42:15.337 --> 00:42:16.739
I shot him.

00:43:36.085 --> 00:43:37.686
Keep in touch even after you move.

00:43:37.753 --> 00:43:38.821
I won't.

00:43:43.392 --> 00:43:45.160
- Why?
- Just shut up.

00:43:48.063 --> 00:43:49.598
You shouldn't be

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.634
with someone like me!

00:44:00.776 --> 00:44:02.411
The person who killed Oshima…

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.547
was me.

00:44:13.055 --> 00:44:15.791
That doesn't mean
I can continue being a police officer.

00:44:15.858 --> 00:44:18.927
I think you became a police officer
because you committed a crime.

00:44:18.994 --> 00:44:19.862
{\an8}THE FINAL CULPRIT IS IDENTIFIED

00:44:19.928 --> 00:44:21.563
{\an8}I'm a suspect, aren't I?

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:23.665
{\an8}Junichi, do you think Makiko did it?

00:44:23.732 --> 00:44:25.768
{\an8}I can't undo the fact…

00:44:25.834 --> 00:44:27.102
{\an8}that I have committed a crime.

00:44:27.169 --> 00:44:28.003
{\an8}CAN SOMEONE WHO COMMITTED A CRIME
BE FORGIVEN?

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:28.971
