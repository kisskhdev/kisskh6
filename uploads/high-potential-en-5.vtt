WEBVTT

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:13.858
- Come on, let me do it.
- Dude, hey, stop.

00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:15.650
Come on. Let go.

00:00:15.783 --> 00:00:17.685
You're gonna make me crash. No!

00:00:18.653 --> 00:00:19.754
No.

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.193
Look, it's still filming.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:29.396
Is that a car?

00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:35.035
Oh!

00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:01.128
How did you find me?

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.874
Well, when you wouldn't take my
calls, I had to stalk your reviews.

00:01:03.898 --> 00:01:07.869
Turns out Steve from Pen Tech, very
satisfied with his Thursday lawn care.

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:09.136
Five stars.

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:10.939
What can I help you with, Morgan?

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.884
I was just wondering why you'd give
me your business card and then ghost me.

00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:16.744
Roman asked me
to check on you and his kid.

00:01:16.878 --> 00:01:18.445
I told him you were good.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.714
The job is done.

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:21.916
So you and Roman are what? Pen pals?

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.687
Before I got the call, I hadn't
spoken to the man in 15 years.

00:01:26.654 --> 00:01:29.057
So, someone you haven't
spoken with in over a decade calls,

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.492
and you drop everything to go
pick up a backpack in Nevada,

00:01:32.627 --> 00:01:34.294
and then spy on my daughter and me?

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:36.396
Yeah, well, it sure seems that way.

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:38.566
Do you know where Roman is?

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:41.234
Roman called me
from a burner, all right?

00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:43.571
I didn't even see him
when I got out there, so.

00:01:45.073 --> 00:01:46.708
I want that backpack.

00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:49.944
Then, why don't you ask some
of your cop friends about that?

00:01:50.078 --> 00:01:51.755
- They can help you with it.
- Yeah, you're right.

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:54.147
I am friends with some people
in the LAPD.

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:55.281
Mm-hmm.

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:57.518
Including the Financial Crimes division.

00:01:57.652 --> 00:02:00.387
I wonder if they would peek
into your business for me.

00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:02.721
You know what? You probably
have nothing to worry about.

00:02:02.757 --> 00:02:04.525
I'm sure you've reported
every single dollar

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.761
of your cash-only business
to the IRS, right?

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:10.297
Good. I'll be in touch
with a time and a place.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.299
Keep up the five-star work, Arthur.

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:18.438
One of the things I'm most
proud of as your lieutenant

00:02:18.573 --> 00:02:20.808
is this team's commitment to its duty.

00:02:20.942 --> 00:02:24.177
Every day, you tackle the toughest
crimes this city throws at you

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.146
with honor and tenacity.

00:02:26.648 --> 00:02:29.917
And tenacious is also how I
would describe Captain Wagner.

00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:32.285
His track record speaks for itself.

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.287
Welcome, Captain Nick Wagner.

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:40.160
Thank you, Lieutenant Soto.

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:43.363
I know what it's like
to have a change in command

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:45.432
and all the uncertainties
that come with it,

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:47.702
which is why I want to be clear up front.

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:49.202
I'm not here to step on toes.

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:52.607
My job is to support you,
so you can do yours.

00:02:53.141 --> 00:02:57.645
I'm looking forward
to getting to know you better.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:05.185
And to start that process, I'm gonna
be meeting with you individually.

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:07.187
It's nothing formal. Just some talk.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.758
And since my office is on three,
I was hoping Lieutenant Soto

00:03:10.892 --> 00:03:13.961
wouldn't mind if I used hers
as home base for a few days.

00:03:14.896 --> 00:03:16.731
- Whatever you need, Captain.
- Great.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:19.399
Thank you, everyone.

00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:23.071
Detective Ozdil, free for a chat?

00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:25.540
Sure.

00:03:30.745 --> 00:03:33.748
Hey, you okay with all this?

00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:35.926
Are you referring to getting
kicked out of my own office

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.119
or Captain Wagner in general?

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:39.251
Yes.

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:42.255
I'm fine, really.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.059
First few days of new command
is always a little bumpy.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.200
Daphne. What do we know
about Wagner?

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:54.367
Well I know he's one of the Wagners.

00:03:54.502 --> 00:03:57.171
- What does that mean?
- The Wagners are an LAPD dynasty.

00:03:57.304 --> 00:03:59.941
Grandfather, father, uncle.
All made captain.

00:04:00.074 --> 00:04:02.114
His dad retired a decade ago
and went into politics.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.655
I heard his dad pulled some
strings to get his son into command.

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:06.514
Must be nice to have that kind of in.

00:04:06.647 --> 00:04:08.348
Hey, guys. I just got a call.

00:04:08.482 --> 00:04:10.752
Dead body found at Shay Ranch Pond.

00:04:10.885 --> 00:04:11.919
Go check it out.

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:28.202
What are we looking at?

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:30.238
Victim was shot in the chest. No ID.

00:04:30.705 --> 00:04:33.406
Car is registered
to a Tori Nolan. Thirty-one.

00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:35.109
We pulled a pic from the DMV.

00:04:35.243 --> 00:04:37.812
We think the car might
have been stolen by the vic.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:45.820
No, she didn't steal Tori
Nolan's car. She is Tori Nolan.

00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:49.422
<i>Looks like Tori
had some work done recently.</i>

00:04:49.557 --> 00:04:53.360
<i>Botox, microplaning, threads,
cheek fillers, eyelash extensions.</i>

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:55.173
<i>She chopped her hair off
and dyed it brown.</i>

00:04:56.664 --> 00:04:59.243
Sounds like she went through a lot
of trouble to change her appearance.

00:04:59.267 --> 00:05:02.469
Yeah, either she succumbed to the
pressures of being a woman in LA,

00:05:02.603 --> 00:05:04.337
- or she was hiding from someone.
- Mmm.

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.775
Hey, these bullet wounds definitely
came from a small caliber, maybe a .380.

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:10.011
Those are steam burns,
but look, these seem chemical.

00:05:10.144 --> 00:05:12.113
There's red staining
on her clothes and skin too.

00:05:12.246 --> 00:05:14.916
None of it looks like blood.
Some kind of dye?

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:18.786
All the windows are missing.

00:05:19.687 --> 00:05:21.022
Might have been shot out.

00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:29.462
Looks like Tori had a storage unit.

00:05:29.597 --> 00:05:33.134
Hold on. Why is this still
dripping? The rest of the dash is dry.

00:05:33.968 --> 00:05:35.203
Okay.

00:05:36.938 --> 00:05:39.339
So Tori Nolan changed her face,
carried a gun,

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:42.043
only to get shot, burned,
and dumped into a pond.

00:05:45.246 --> 00:05:48.182
Well, whoever she was hiding
from, it looks like they found her.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.657
Hula Hound. And you
know about this place because

00:05:56.791 --> 00:05:58.726
I know all the bars in LA
with trivia nights.

00:05:59.327 --> 00:06:02.663
Don't judge me. Knowing random
facts is the whole point of a pub quiz.

00:06:02.797 --> 00:06:04.464
- They love it.
- Mmm.

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:07.477
Maybe they don't love it
because, you know,

00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:09.613
I'm banned from most of them,
but that's not why we're here.

00:06:09.637 --> 00:06:11.682
We're here because you said
Tori had a storage unit, right?

00:06:11.706 --> 00:06:13.074
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:14.942
Ta-da.

00:06:17.278 --> 00:06:19.680
Nobody's popping into
the Hula Hound for no reason,

00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:21.682
and I'm thinking
Tori's reason was proximity.

00:06:21.816 --> 00:06:23.536
Yeah, it's as good a place to start as any.

00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:25.264
Tori's last known address
was in Koreatown,

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.164
but landlord said she hasn't
lived there for years.

00:06:27.188 --> 00:06:29.690
- Let's go see what she was storing.
- Let's.

00:06:42.103 --> 00:06:44.437
- What do these mean?
- I don't know yet.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.210
There was no laptop in Tori's car.

00:06:49.343 --> 00:06:50.912
Maybe the killer took it.

00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:02.556
Whoa. Look at these.

00:07:07.695 --> 00:07:09.063
Ha.

00:07:09.196 --> 00:07:11.599
All these match up with the
places on the filing cabinets.

00:07:12.233 --> 00:07:14.635
Tori was traveling the world
under assumed identities.

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:17.071
Who was this girl? Carmen Sandiego?

00:07:21.075 --> 00:07:24.679
It's gonna take days to
piece all that back together.

00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:30.450
We might not have to.

00:07:30.584 --> 00:07:33.988
Okay, so everywhere Tori traveled,
there was some sort of big scandal.

00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:36.691
Crystal Lake had
this massive E. Coli outbreak

00:07:36.824 --> 00:07:38.826
from faulty water pipes in July of 2018.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.129
Late 2023, an American au pair agency

00:07:42.263 --> 00:07:44.799
was running a human
trafficking ring out of Cambodia.

00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:46.801
And do you see these
red symbols right here?

00:07:47.835 --> 00:07:49.403
Those are editing marks.

00:07:49.537 --> 00:07:53.274
And these numbers, they're dates
and issue numbers from a magazine.

00:07:53.908 --> 00:07:55.843
Tori wasn't an international
woman of mystery.

00:07:55.977 --> 00:07:57.745
She was an investigative reporter.

00:07:57.878 --> 00:08:00.948
Well, whatever story she was covering
now might have gotten her killed.

00:08:02.416 --> 00:08:04.652
Find anything in Tori Nolan's financials?

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.921
Oz.

00:08:07.455 --> 00:08:10.658
- Oz.
- Uh. Sorry.

00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:13.928
Okay, you've been acting weird ever
since your meeting with the captain.

00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:16.230
- I thought you said it went well.
- Yeah, it did.

00:08:16.364 --> 00:08:18.666
I think. I don't know.

00:08:19.767 --> 00:08:22.003
You'll see when you meet with him.

00:08:24.672 --> 00:08:26.374
<i>Daphne, what'd you find out?</i>

00:08:26.507 --> 00:08:28.609
Okay, I cross-referenced the location,

00:08:28.743 --> 00:08:30.411
<i>dates, and issue numbers you sent.</i>

00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:33.147
Morgan was right. Tori was a
journalist for <i>Takedown Magazine,</i>

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.883
an online publication
known for its exposés.

00:08:36.017 --> 00:08:38.853
<i>According to her editor, Tori
always wrote under a pseudonym.</i>

00:08:38.986 --> 00:08:42.757
Apparently she got doxed after an article
she published in her college newspaper.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.393
Having her private information
blasted all over the Internet

00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:47.206
was so traumatic
she dropped out of school.

00:08:47.328 --> 00:08:49.663
Did the editor know what Tori
was currently investigating?

00:08:49.797 --> 00:08:51.532
No, but that wasn't unusual.

00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:54.011
She said Tori would drop off
the grid when following a story.

00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:56.670
Good news is they insisted
on getting proof of life from her

00:08:56.804 --> 00:08:59.407
whenever she was undercover,
so I'm sending that to you now.

00:09:03.477 --> 00:09:06.781
This is recent.
She had the same nails on when she died.

00:09:06.914 --> 00:09:08.582
There's no grow-out around the cuticles.

00:09:08.716 --> 00:09:10.694
But this picture could have
been taken anywhere, Morgan.

00:09:10.718 --> 00:09:13.358
There's no landmarks or anything
else in the background we can use.

00:09:14.355 --> 00:09:15.356
Not true.

00:09:15.489 --> 00:09:16.957
You got a poodle dog.

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:21.128
There's literally no poodle.

00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:27.635
Okay, I get it.

00:09:27.768 --> 00:09:30.971
We're looking for poodle dog plants,
but how do you know this is the right area?

00:09:31.105 --> 00:09:34.775
Because there was a fire in
these hills just a few months ago.

00:09:34.909 --> 00:09:38.112
Poodle dog bushes
are pyrophytes. Fire followers.

00:09:38.245 --> 00:09:41.882
<i>Their seeds lay dormant until the
intense heat of a fire wakes them up.</i>

00:09:42.016 --> 00:09:44.385
Based on the size of the plant
in this picture she took.

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:46.587
This location fits the timeline.

00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:50.391
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look.
Look, we're getting close. See?

00:09:50.525 --> 00:09:52.493
Okay, stop. Check it out.

00:09:52.626 --> 00:09:54.862
- She took the picture right here.
- -Hmm.

00:09:55.564 --> 00:10:00.401
Okay, if I am Tori, I am not
taking no trespassing for an answer.

00:10:00.535 --> 00:10:01.536
If you're Tori?

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.550
Well, why would I? Any bozo
can buy a sign, tack it to a fence.

00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:08.142
Morgan, whoever put up
that sign, they might mean it.

00:10:08.275 --> 00:10:11.445
Tori's embedded herself in some dangerous
situations with some dangerous people,

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.647
so we don't know what we
might be walking into here.

00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:23.858
What is this place?

00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:25.493
Oh, you don't have a teenager.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.962
This is a content house.

00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:46.247
These guys all live here and shoot
videos for their streaming platforms.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.282
Could explain Tori's enhancements.

00:10:48.415 --> 00:10:52.386
She'd have to be camera ready 24-7 if
she was going undercover as an influencer.

00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:56.190
Mmm. Well, this isn't really on par
with the other stories she went after.

00:10:56.323 --> 00:10:57.603
What was she investigating here?

00:10:58.893 --> 00:11:00.094
Can I help you?

00:11:00.227 --> 00:11:02.631
I'm Detective Karadec.
This is Morgan Gillory, LAPD.

00:11:03.598 --> 00:11:05.032
You recognize this woman?

00:11:06.167 --> 00:11:07.168
That's Darla.

00:11:08.435 --> 00:11:09.870
She lives here.

00:11:11.872 --> 00:11:12.973
Is she okay?

00:11:13.107 --> 00:11:16.310
No, unfortunately she's not. She's dead.

00:11:17.111 --> 00:11:20.881
Hey. Anyone else want
to take a dip in the gel-cuzzi?

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:26.487
Uh, that's a no?

00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:29.223
Darla Well, Tori, I guess,

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:31.916
she'd only been in the house a
few weeks, but everyone liked her.

00:11:31.992 --> 00:11:34.663
- What kind of content did she make?
- ASMR videos.

00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:36.997
Her channel wasn't doing great,
but it was growing.

00:11:37.131 --> 00:11:38.799
When's the last time you saw Tori?

00:11:38.933 --> 00:11:40.801
A day ago, maybe two.

00:11:40.935 --> 00:11:43.538
When everyone's filming,
we tend to lose track of time.

00:11:43.672 --> 00:11:45.507
Do you know anyone
who would want to hurt her?

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.474
No, we've all had
creeps in our comments,

00:11:47.609 --> 00:11:49.877
but Tori never mentioned
anyone she was concerned about.

00:11:50.344 --> 00:11:52.104
Do you think one
of her followers killed her?

00:11:52.213 --> 00:11:53.682
Well, we're not ruling anything out.

00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:55.082
Thanks. We'll be in touch.

00:11:55.216 --> 00:11:58.052
No one claims to know what happened.

00:11:58.185 --> 00:11:59.820
You got anything?

00:11:59.954 --> 00:12:02.591
Just that these kids are under
a crazy amount of pressure.

00:12:02.723 --> 00:12:04.693
You know, that bit
that Prénkz was doing?

00:12:04.825 --> 00:12:07.795
<i>A six-ounce box of gelatin
makes two cups.</i>

00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:10.665
<i>A standard kiddie pool
is about 400 gallons.</i>

00:12:10.798 --> 00:12:13.535
<i>That's 3,360 boxes just to fill it up.</i>

00:12:13.668 --> 00:12:16.605
<i>I'm guessing from set-up
to clean-up, that's what?</i>

00:12:16.737 --> 00:12:19.073
<i>Thirty hours of work
for a 30-second video.</i>

00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:22.561
That's barely gonna move
the needle on his goal chart.

00:12:22.611 --> 00:12:25.412
This guy Phineas is running
this place like a sweatshop.

00:12:30.518 --> 00:12:33.688
Okay. Looks like we found Prénkz's lair.

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:39.527
Red dye?

00:12:39.661 --> 00:12:41.501
Like the red dye
that was all over Tori's body?

00:12:41.563 --> 00:12:43.732
What are you gonna say?
You don't know what happened.

00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:46.333
- Just let me talk!
- Play it cool. Okay, we're going in.

00:12:46.467 --> 00:12:48.637
Something you guys wanna tell us?

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.339
- We did it. We did it. We killed her.
- Uh. It was an accident.

00:12:52.473 --> 00:12:53.642
One of you shot Tori?

00:12:53.774 --> 00:12:55.075
She was shot?

00:12:55.209 --> 00:12:56.645
How do you think you killed her?

00:12:56.777 --> 00:12:58.112
Like that.

00:12:58.912 --> 00:13:00.515
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. Karadec!

00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:01.891
- You might wanna turn back.
- What.

00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:03.951
- Oh!
- Oh, geez.

00:13:17.097 --> 00:13:21.636
Darla, um, Tori leaves the house every
Wednesday afternoon to do errands.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:26.840
Since we knew she'd be in her car, Prénkz
and I set up a situation in her back seat.

00:13:27.776 --> 00:13:29.343
What kind of a situation?

00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:31.211
The devil's toothpaste.

00:13:31.345 --> 00:13:34.783
Exactly what happened to
Detective Karadec, except bigger.

00:13:37.217 --> 00:13:38.485
Show me.

00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:43.157
<i>Get ready.</i>

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.159
<i>This is gonna get so many hits.</i>

00:13:45.292 --> 00:13:47.729
<i>Sorry, Darla, but you asked for this.</i>

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.865
Oh, my God.

00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:53.735
<i>- What do we do?
- I don't know.</i>

00:13:53.867 --> 00:13:56.112
<i>Hurry, the car's still rolling.
We need to get outta here.</i>

00:13:56.136 --> 00:13:57.838
<i>Just stop filming, Prénkz!</i>

00:13:57.971 --> 00:13:59.340
Did you check on her?

00:13:59.473 --> 00:14:01.643
Well, we freaked out,
so we called Phineas.

00:14:01.776 --> 00:14:02.876
He runs Cloud House.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.746
Phineas said Darla
was fine but really mad.

00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:06.624
She was just gonna go
for a drive and cool off.

00:14:06.648 --> 00:14:09.316
No, with a force like that,
Tori was definitely concussed.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:10.585
She wasn't driving anywhere.

00:14:10.719 --> 00:14:13.387
You guys, that was
a really dangerous prank.

00:14:13.521 --> 00:14:16.156
I know. I didn't think it'd be
that big of an explosion.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.391
All right, what was in it?

00:14:17.525 --> 00:14:21.195
Just dye, soap, yeast, and peroxide.

00:14:21.328 --> 00:14:22.797
- How much peroxide?
- A lot.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:24.998
A lot. Okay, well,
that explains the steam burns.

00:14:25.132 --> 00:14:28.035
<i>When hydrogen peroxide meets yeast,</i>

00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:31.706
it produces a lot of oxygen
and a lot of heat.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.441
The oxygen forms a fabulous foam,

00:14:34.576 --> 00:14:38.747
and the higher the peroxide
percentage, the bigger the boom.

00:14:42.049 --> 00:14:43.969
It also explains the lack
of blood in Tori's car.

00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:45.428
The peroxide would have cleaned it up.

00:14:45.452 --> 00:14:46.554
Mmm.

00:14:46.688 --> 00:14:49.089
In the video, you said
Tori asked for it. Why?

00:14:49.724 --> 00:14:52.092
She stole my L3 protein powder.

00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:53.427
Live Laugh Lift.

00:14:53.561 --> 00:14:55.481
I was supposed to do
an exclusive promo for them.

00:14:55.563 --> 00:14:58.465
I'm the only content creator in the
country to get L3 before the launch.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.034
It was gonna bring a ton
of traffic to my channel,

00:15:01.168 --> 00:15:03.203
but Tori stole the powder
before I could film it.

00:15:03.337 --> 00:15:04.706
Why would she do that?

00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:06.851
Probably because her own
channel wasn't doing so well,

00:15:06.875 --> 00:15:08.275
so she wanted to sabotage mine.

00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:12.079
Those morons could've
killed Tori with that dumb prank,

00:15:12.212 --> 00:15:14.492
but I don't think they shot
her. I think someone else did.

00:15:14.549 --> 00:15:19.920
Look, red dye and tire tracks
extend down into those weeds.

00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:21.827
I think this is where Tori was shot.

00:15:27.695 --> 00:15:29.597
Wonder who would've wanted to do that.

00:15:36.871 --> 00:15:38.807
Let's get back to the car.
I'll put out a BOLO.

00:15:38.939 --> 00:15:40.642
Hold on one second.

00:15:40.775 --> 00:15:42.744
Did you just try
and chase after a sports car?

00:15:42.877 --> 00:15:44.378
It was an instinct.

00:15:44.512 --> 00:15:47.080
Your instinct was that you could
catch up to a twin-turbo V-8?

00:15:47.214 --> 00:15:49.584
- Morgan.
- This might be the best day of my life.

00:15:49.717 --> 00:15:50.819
Uh-huh.

00:15:50.951 --> 00:15:52.763
I just wanna thank you
for that beautiful gift.

00:15:52.787 --> 00:15:53.822
Okay.

00:15:59.661 --> 00:16:01.328
We didn't know you'd be home early.

00:16:01.896 --> 00:16:03.765
Clearly. What is this?

00:16:03.898 --> 00:16:05.265
Oh, a PB and J.

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:06.868
Cookies are not bread.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.103
Argh. Air patrol's out looking
for a guy, so I got a little time.

00:16:10.237 --> 00:16:12.473
That's so cool. You should
have asked for a fly along.

00:16:12.607 --> 00:16:15.008
Mmm. I prefer to do my barfing on land.

00:16:16.343 --> 00:16:18.345
Hey, uh, Elliot,
can you go grab your sister?

00:16:18.479 --> 00:16:20.080
I thought you were hiring a babysitter.

00:16:20.214 --> 00:16:21.816
Can you just go get her?

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.093
Please? You're her favorite
person in the whole wide world.

00:16:24.117 --> 00:16:25.930
I know you're just saying that
to manipulate me.

00:16:25.954 --> 00:16:27.087
Is it working?

00:16:27.622 --> 00:16:30.692
Yes, but only because it's
true. She's a big Elliot fan.

00:16:30.825 --> 00:16:33.494
- Aren't we all?
- Mmm. He's all right.

00:16:35.563 --> 00:16:37.264
Argh. Gross.

00:16:40.334 --> 00:16:42.169
The other reason I wanted
to swing by home was

00:16:42.302 --> 00:16:45.573
to let you know that I tracked
down Arthur this morning.

00:16:45.707 --> 00:16:47.241
- The guy who knows my dad?
- Mm-hmm.

00:16:47.374 --> 00:16:48.710
Does he know where he is?

00:16:48.843 --> 00:16:51.044
No, but he did agree
to give me his backpack.

00:16:51.178 --> 00:16:53.480
- Okay, let's go get it.
- Hey hold on a second.

00:16:53.615 --> 00:16:55.884
We haven't figured out
a time or a place yet,

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:57.886
but when we do, I will get the backpack.

00:16:58.452 --> 00:16:59.988
- I can't go with you?
- No.

00:17:00.522 --> 00:17:03.090
- Why not?
- We don't even know who this guy is.

00:17:03.223 --> 00:17:04.863
I'm not letting him
anywhere near you. No.

00:17:04.926 --> 00:17:07.027
- But, Mom, what if he has information or.
- Ava.

00:17:07.529 --> 00:17:08.830
It's not a negotiation.

00:17:10.297 --> 00:17:11.331
Okay.

00:17:12.634 --> 00:17:13.935
I'll keep you posted.

00:17:20.842 --> 00:17:23.511
Phineas's orange
Lamborghini wasn't hard to find.

00:17:23.645 --> 00:17:26.113
Highway patrol picked him up
in Ventura an hour ago.

00:17:26.246 --> 00:17:27.949
So far he's had nothing to say.

00:17:28.081 --> 00:17:31.027
Keeping his mouth shut is probably
the smartest thing he's done in a while.

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:32.085
Mm-hmm.

00:17:32.654 --> 00:17:34.288
I'm not interrupting, am I?

00:17:34.421 --> 00:17:38.158
No, Detectives Oz and Karadec
are letting Phineas sweat a bit

00:17:38.292 --> 00:17:40.227
before starting their interrogation.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.730
Good. So Detective Forrester
has a minute.

00:17:43.531 --> 00:17:46.466
I hope you don't mind, but I stopped
at your desk and I couldn't resist.

00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:48.168
No, that's what they're there for.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.606
I never had a sweet tooth
until I joined the force.

00:17:51.739 --> 00:17:53.741
Now I can't go a day
without having sugar.

00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:55.643
Oh, well, there is worse habits.

00:17:55.777 --> 00:17:59.112
True, and there's some habits
that serve you well on your job.

00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:00.648
I saw your file, Detective.

00:18:00.782 --> 00:18:04.018
Have you ever considered
sitting for the sergeant's exam?

00:18:04.719 --> 00:18:08.856
Y-Yeah, I thought
about it, but nothing serious.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.392
You should. I have a friend
that used to be a test assessor.

00:18:12.527 --> 00:18:15.095
He can give you tips, get you
the right study materials.

00:18:15.228 --> 00:18:18.733
That's great, but you know,
I'm really happy here and...

00:18:18.866 --> 00:18:21.035
No, of course you are,
but it never hurts to

00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:23.905
be curious about
broadening your horizons.

00:18:24.038 --> 00:18:26.074
I'm sure Lieutenant Soto would agree.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.443
- I do.
- I love to hear it.

00:18:29.577 --> 00:18:32.145
- I'll set it up.
- Thank you.

00:18:36.183 --> 00:18:37.384
What did I miss?

00:18:37.518 --> 00:18:39.687
Nothing. They haven't started
the interrogation yet,

00:18:39.821 --> 00:18:41.556
but I'm glad you popped in, Morgan.

00:18:41.689 --> 00:18:44.049
I was hoping we could sit down
and have that talk and see...

00:18:44.092 --> 00:18:46.493
Ye Oh. You know what, I-I Great.

00:18:46.628 --> 00:18:49.162
I can't though 'cause I gotta
give this my attention, so later.

00:18:49.296 --> 00:18:51.056
Maybe someone can
tell me what this is about.

00:18:51.099 --> 00:18:52.132
Maybe.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.768
Of course.

00:18:53.901 --> 00:18:57.005
- Let's talk about Tori Nolan.
- Who?

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:58.983
The reporter you shot
and then dumped in a pond.

00:18:59.007 --> 00:19:01.367
We're thinking you found out
she was embedded at your house.

00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:04.344
You were worried about the story
she'd run, and so you got rid of her.

00:19:04.478 --> 00:19:05.647
You mean Darla?

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.540
So the details are familiar
but not the name.

00:19:07.582 --> 00:19:09.249
I d-didn't know that was Darla.

00:19:09.383 --> 00:19:11.653
I-I definitely didn't know
that she was a reporter.

00:19:11.786 --> 00:19:13.220
Why was she at Cloud House?

00:19:13.353 --> 00:19:14.798
We were wondering the same
thing, but then we had a look

00:19:14.822 --> 00:19:15.822
at your financials.

00:19:15.923 --> 00:19:18.392
- $200,000 sports car.
- Mmm.

00:19:18.526 --> 00:19:21.095
Several stays at the Ibiza Four Seasons.

00:19:21.228 --> 00:19:23.641
You work the kids hard, pay
them way less than they're earning,

00:19:23.665 --> 00:19:25.075
then skim all the profits for yourself.

00:19:25.099 --> 00:19:26.701
That sounds like a story to me.

00:19:26.834 --> 00:19:28.979
Any money that I take from the
creators is for their room and board.

00:19:29.003 --> 00:19:31.739
Right. 50K a month each.

00:19:31.873 --> 00:19:33.433
Seems a bit steep, doesn't it, Phineas?

00:19:33.473 --> 00:19:34.909
Even by Los Angeles standards.

00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:38.478
- I gotta do a quick mic pop.
- A what?

00:19:39.479 --> 00:19:40.882
I need to see his watch.

00:19:41.015 --> 00:19:42.182
Watch, please.

00:19:42.315 --> 00:19:43.450
Thank you.

00:19:46.721 --> 00:19:49.423
Check out the joints. There's
corrosion in there, you see that?

00:19:49.557 --> 00:19:53.628
That's what happens when titanium comes
in contact with concentrated peroxide.

00:19:54.162 --> 00:19:57.230
Ooh. You see, after the explosion,
Tori was covered in that, Phineas,

00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:59.604
and you must have gotten a
good bit of it on yourself too

00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:02.070
when you moved her body
from the driver's seat.

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:05.039
You were in Tori's car after
Raquel and Prénkz foamed it.

00:20:05.173 --> 00:20:07.809
You're the one who shot her
and then moved the car.

00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:14.082
I moved the body,
but I swear I did not kill her.

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:15.750
Uh. There was so much
foam everywhere.

00:20:15.883 --> 00:20:18.186
I had no idea that she was shot
until I got to the pond.

00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:20.588
If you didn't kill her,
why'd you move the body?

00:20:21.189 --> 00:20:22.789
Because I'd lose the lease on the house.

00:20:22.857 --> 00:20:25.860
Landlord's been trying to
evict Cloud House for months.

00:20:25.993 --> 00:20:27.929
The neighbors hate us,
and if they kick us out,

00:20:28.062 --> 00:20:29.731
I'd have to shut the entire thing down.

00:20:29.864 --> 00:20:32.399
- Can you prove that you didn't kill her?
- I can.

00:20:32.533 --> 00:20:34.035
Do you guys know what bots are?

00:20:34.168 --> 00:20:35.770
Fake account holders
on social networks.

00:20:35.903 --> 00:20:37.548
People use them
to pad their followers. Yeah.

00:20:37.572 --> 00:20:41.576
Exactly. Darla's number...
Tori's numbers were terrible,

00:20:41.709 --> 00:20:45.345
and right before Prénkz
and Raquel came running up,

00:20:45.479 --> 00:20:48.583
I was in my office buying bots
to pump up Tori's channel.

00:20:49.449 --> 00:20:50.885
Which you never would have done

00:20:51.018 --> 00:20:52.896
if you were planning on
getting rid of her a minute later.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.988
Exactly.

00:20:56.691 --> 00:20:57.792
Damn it.

00:21:04.766 --> 00:21:08.503
We booked Phineas for evidence
tampering and illegal transport.

00:21:08.636 --> 00:21:11.404
He offered up Tori's bag as
a bargaining chip for leniency.

00:21:11.539 --> 00:21:13.741
Said he took it
to keep anyone from ID'ing her.

00:21:13.875 --> 00:21:16.520
Somebody who loves cars didn't think
we could find her through her VIN number?

00:21:16.544 --> 00:21:18.478
Come on.

00:21:19.247 --> 00:21:21.949
Great. Tori has state-of-the-art
encryption on here.

00:21:22.083 --> 00:21:23.751
Not surprising for someone with her job.

00:21:25.418 --> 00:21:28.756
Raquel was right.
Tori did steal the protein powder.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:30.601
But why? I checked Tori's
Cloud House channel.

00:21:30.625 --> 00:21:32.703
- She never advertised it.
- Yeah, well, why would she?

00:21:32.727 --> 00:21:34.403
She didn't actually
care about her numbers,

00:21:34.427 --> 00:21:36.597
which means she wouldn't
sabotage somebody else's.

00:21:36.731 --> 00:21:37.865
Morgan, how about this?

00:21:37.999 --> 00:21:39.934
You recognize anything
in these lab results?

00:21:41.702 --> 00:21:44.672
Yeah, nothing super
interesting, except castoreum.

00:21:44.806 --> 00:21:46.473
- What's that?
- Beaver butt secretion.

00:21:46.607 --> 00:21:48.676
It's a flavoring agent.

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.378
So is ethyl methylphenylglycidate.

00:21:51.512 --> 00:21:53.047
Artificial strawberry.

00:21:53.181 --> 00:21:55.783
I know that from my weekly fight
with my kids in the cereal aisle.

00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:57.350
Yep.

00:21:58.485 --> 00:21:59.921
Strawberry.

00:22:00.054 --> 00:22:02.290
Okay, so Tori wasn't
investigating the content house,

00:22:02.422 --> 00:22:04.959
she was investigating
the protein powder. Why?

00:22:05.092 --> 00:22:08.663
Yeah, the woman made a career
out of exposing major scandals.

00:22:09.263 --> 00:22:10.497
<i>She covered corruption.</i>

00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:12.967
<i>She saved animals from abuse.</i>

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.336
<i>She took on big oil.
And then protein powder?</i>

00:22:16.469 --> 00:22:18.773
Going after a small-time
product doesn't make any sense.

00:22:21.943 --> 00:22:23.476
We said she was doxed, right?

00:22:23.611 --> 00:22:25.478
Yeah, she wrote an article
about a classmate

00:22:25.613 --> 00:22:27.548
who was running
a test-taker-for-hire business.

00:22:27.682 --> 00:22:29.150
He cyberbullied her for revenge.

00:22:29.283 --> 00:22:32.385
His name was, um, Robert Romano.

00:22:33.621 --> 00:22:35.355
Well, I think he goes by Bobby now.

00:22:44.866 --> 00:22:46.634
- Thank you.
- Robert Romano?

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.537
Whoa, my full name.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.673
That's what my mom calls me
when I'm in trouble.

00:22:54.642 --> 00:22:56.602
- Wait, am I in trouble?
- No, we just wanna talk.

00:22:56.711 --> 00:22:58.121
It's an impressive operation you got here.

00:22:58.145 --> 00:23:01.315
Thanks, man. Yeah,
it's exciting times at L3.

00:23:01.448 --> 00:23:02.728
Yeah, our pre-orders are flying.

00:23:02.817 --> 00:23:05.319
I'm trying to stay humble,
but I got a feeling.

00:23:05.452 --> 00:23:08.522
Live Laugh Lift is gonna
revolutionize the fitness industry.

00:23:09.389 --> 00:23:10.791
Really?

00:23:10.925 --> 00:23:13.294
Oh. 'Cause it kind of looks
like you're just repackaging

00:23:13.426 --> 00:23:17.064
a bunch of bulk protein powder from
China and slapping your label on it.

00:23:17.198 --> 00:23:19.233
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
It's way more than that.

00:23:19.367 --> 00:23:20.868
- Is it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:21.002 --> 00:23:23.871
L3 is a movement, okay?
This guy gets it. I can tell.

00:23:24.005 --> 00:23:26.374
Bobby, San Dimas
delivery is gonna be late.

00:23:26.507 --> 00:23:28.209
The truck got a flat.

00:23:28.709 --> 00:23:31.521
If you two are from the health department,
our certifications are incompliance.

00:23:31.545 --> 00:23:33.985
Don't worry, they're not health
inspectors. They're just cops.

00:23:35.383 --> 00:23:38.286
Guys, this is Lamar Vulpis.
He's my operations manager.

00:23:38.418 --> 00:23:39.921
Can we help you with something?

00:23:40.054 --> 00:23:41.732
Yeah, we were hoping to take
a look around, Lamar.

00:23:41.756 --> 00:23:43.190
Sure, you got a warrant?

00:23:43.324 --> 00:23:45.569
I don't know. Is there something
here that warrants a warrant?

00:23:45.593 --> 00:23:48.863
Whoa, no, no. We don't They
don't need a warrant, dude.

00:23:48.996 --> 00:23:50.716
- We're just talking, right?
- That's right.

00:23:50.765 --> 00:23:53.601
Yeah. Look, Lamar, I'll call San Dimas.

00:23:53.734 --> 00:23:55.803
- You got it, Boss.
- Okay, thank you.

00:23:58.105 --> 00:24:01.175
I know, he seems pretty
tough, right? That's just his job.

00:24:01.309 --> 00:24:02.686
I couldn't run the place without him.

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:03.911
Hmm -Yeah, I don't doubt it.

00:24:04.045 --> 00:24:06.247
I mean, your other businesses
were all scams, right?

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.820
Designer shoe company that
turned out to be low-end knockoffs.

00:24:08.883 --> 00:24:10.961
The concert app that was
kicking out fraudulent tickets.

00:24:10.985 --> 00:24:12.763
Oh, yeah. That one got you
pinched for wire fraud.

00:24:12.787 --> 00:24:14.555
You did two years in prison, right?

00:24:14.689 --> 00:24:17.367
Mm-hmm. Yeah, the feds got interested
in you because of an anonymous tip,

00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:19.894
but she wasn't so anonymous
for you, was she?

00:24:21.128 --> 00:24:23.097
- Yeah, you're talking about Tori Nolan?
- Hmm.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:24.999
- She just has it out for me.
- Oh, yeah?

00:24:25.132 --> 00:24:27.577
You think it had anything to do
with the time you doxed her so bad

00:24:27.601 --> 00:24:28.936
she had to drop out of school?

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.838
I really regret that.

00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:34.675
I was a stupid kid, and I did stupid things.

00:24:39.613 --> 00:24:40.681
Please.

00:24:42.283 --> 00:24:43.818
So, why are you asking about Tori?

00:24:43.951 --> 00:24:46.554
Well, Bobby, um, she's dead.

00:24:49.557 --> 00:24:51.258
That's heavy.

00:24:51.392 --> 00:24:52.860
Mm-hmm.

00:24:53.794 --> 00:24:55.639
Wait, you don't think I
had something to do with it?

00:24:55.663 --> 00:24:56.663
Strong and smart.

00:24:56.764 --> 00:24:58.699
- He's the whole package.
- Thanks.

00:24:58.833 --> 00:25:00.510
When's the last time
you had contact with Tori?

00:25:00.534 --> 00:25:02.003
Well, she called me a week ago.

00:25:02.136 --> 00:25:04.138
She told me she was
this big reporter now,

00:25:04.271 --> 00:25:06.440
and she was gonna take me
down for good this time.

00:25:06.574 --> 00:25:08.552
- Well, how was she gonna do that?
- I have no idea.

00:25:08.576 --> 00:25:10.277
I hung up on her.

00:25:10.411 --> 00:25:12.422
That kind of negative energy is
not what Live Laugh Lift is all about.

00:25:12.446 --> 00:25:15.916
It's nonsense anyway,
because L3 is legit.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.862
Okay, so that must have really pissed you
off, that she was trying to take it down.

00:25:18.886 --> 00:25:21.088
I wouldn't hurt anyone.

00:25:21.222 --> 00:25:23.457
You can look around
all you want. I'm an open book.

00:25:26.494 --> 00:25:28.362
Morgan -Karadec, he's an open book.

00:25:29.063 --> 00:25:31.332
- Yeah, I'm cool with it.
- He's cool with it.

00:25:32.566 --> 00:25:35.336
He was at a gym across
town when Tori was shot.

00:25:36.237 --> 00:25:38.507
Because I never skip leg day.

00:25:38.639 --> 00:25:40.708
- Can you verify that?
- Yes.

00:25:47.148 --> 00:25:48.582
Oh, you meant, like, an alibi.

00:25:48.716 --> 00:25:50.985
Yeah, my pump partner
can vouch for me.

00:25:51.118 --> 00:25:54.021
Oh, God, this keeps getting better.

00:25:54.155 --> 00:25:57.224
I'll check out Bobby's alibi,
see if the gym had cameras.

00:25:57.358 --> 00:26:00.094
You're saying you don't trust
the word of his pump partner?

00:26:00.227 --> 00:26:01.662
Well, even if his story is true,

00:26:01.796 --> 00:26:03.673
it doesn't mean he had
nothing to do with Tori's death.

00:26:03.697 --> 00:26:05.857
- He could've hired someone to kill her.
- Yeah, maybe.

00:26:05.933 --> 00:26:07.644
His nav app doesn't have
him going to Cloud House,

00:26:07.668 --> 00:26:09.570
however it does say
that he stops by a place

00:26:09.703 --> 00:26:11.672
called Serenity Arms
at least once a week.

00:26:11.806 --> 00:26:13.207
- Mmm.
- It sounds like a cult.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.180
No, actually, it's
a halfway house for ex-cons.

00:26:15.242 --> 00:26:17.154
Maybe Bobby stayed there
after he got out of prison.

00:26:17.178 --> 00:26:18.755
Might be a good place
to get some confirmation

00:26:18.779 --> 00:26:20.147
as to how reformed he actually is.

00:26:22.716 --> 00:26:25.953
Great, I'm being summoned for
my meeting with the captain.

00:26:26.087 --> 00:26:27.922
No, thank you. It's good timing though.

00:26:28.055 --> 00:26:30.333
I gotta grab my car from the
station and deal with a family thing.

00:26:30.357 --> 00:26:31.625
Everything okay?

00:26:31.759 --> 00:26:34.895
Oh, yeah. Never any drama
in the Gillory household.

00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:36.063
Oh, never.

00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:44.371
Detective Karadec, come in.

00:26:46.107 --> 00:26:47.308
Don't worry, it's not yours.

00:26:47.441 --> 00:26:48.642
I wasn't worried.

00:26:48.776 --> 00:26:51.178
Nor should you be.
I didn't even read your file.

00:26:51.312 --> 00:26:53.247
Your reputation precedes you. Please.

00:27:06.427 --> 00:27:08.262
Morgan Gillory, tell me about her.

00:27:08.395 --> 00:27:10.164
I thought this meeting was about me.

00:27:10.297 --> 00:27:12.066
It is, but she's your partner,

00:27:12.199 --> 00:27:15.136
and I think we can both admit
that it's unconventional

00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:17.872
and really not your style, Detective.

00:27:18.005 --> 00:27:19.840
So, you have read my file.

00:27:19.974 --> 00:27:22.886
I don't need to read anything to know
that you're a badge-and-oath kind of guy.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:26.515
But Morgan, she doesn't strike me
as somebody who stays in her lane.

00:27:28.282 --> 00:27:29.618
Well, we work well together

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.862
- if that's what you're getting at.
- You certainly do.

00:27:31.886 --> 00:27:34.655
Your case rate has increased
ever since you two teamed up.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:38.159
You were smart
to claim her as your partner.

00:27:39.326 --> 00:27:41.795
You don't know Morgan if you
think anyone can claim her.

00:27:43.264 --> 00:27:44.264
Mmm.

00:27:51.272 --> 00:27:53.707
Was there something
else you needed, Detective?

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:57.178
No.

00:27:58.812 --> 00:28:02.149
Hey, heard back from the guy that
runs Serenity Arms, Gavin Tillman.

00:28:02.283 --> 00:28:04.418
- He's available to meet.
- Hmm. Let's go.

00:28:22.571 --> 00:28:23.771
I think you forgot something.

00:28:23.904 --> 00:28:25.607
- I wanna talk first.
- About what?

00:28:25.739 --> 00:28:27.642
This is very simple.
You've got the backpack.

00:28:27.775 --> 00:28:29.910
You give me the backpack.
End of transaction.

00:28:33.214 --> 00:28:36.850
So, you really think that,
uh, whatever's in that bag

00:28:36.984 --> 00:28:40.421
will give you answers
and not just more questions?

00:28:42.456 --> 00:28:43.696
You didn't look in it, did you?

00:28:45.826 --> 00:28:46.894
Why?

00:28:47.895 --> 00:28:50.699
I don't know,
I thought about it, you know?

00:28:51.198 --> 00:28:52.866
But I know Roman, okay?

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.868
The dude is solid, and he wouldn't just

00:28:55.002 --> 00:28:58.072
up and disappear from
his people for no reason.

00:28:58.205 --> 00:29:02.409
So, I keep asking myself, what
the hell happened 15 years ago

00:29:02.544 --> 00:29:04.713
that was bad enough
to make a good man run?

00:29:04.845 --> 00:29:08.650
And to be quite honest, I'm not sure
if I wanna know the answer to that.

00:29:08.782 --> 00:29:09.817
Do you?

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:11.986
Yes, so give us the bag.

00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:15.422
What are you
How did you know where I was?

00:29:15.557 --> 00:29:18.125
The family tracker app. You can
see my location, I can see yours.

00:29:18.259 --> 00:29:20.070
- No, we're not doing this, okay?
- No, Mom, stop.

00:29:20.094 --> 00:29:21.262
We didn't get the bag yet.

00:29:21.395 --> 00:29:23.275
You can go, but I'm not
leaving here without it.

00:29:26.267 --> 00:29:27.736
No, it's.

00:29:28.435 --> 00:29:33.073
You look just like your dad when he's
about to start digging into something.

00:29:36.745 --> 00:29:38.713
- You really knew my dad?
- Oh, yeah.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.684
You know, him and me, we went
way back. I mean, we came up together.

00:29:42.816 --> 00:29:44.619
We were practically inseparable.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.722
And he spent so much time at my house,

00:29:47.888 --> 00:29:50.991
ate so many meals, that my
mom started calling him Plates.

00:29:56.096 --> 00:29:57.364
We need your help.

00:29:59.466 --> 00:30:03.937
I don't understand why my
dad left me, but I need to.

00:30:10.745 --> 00:30:14.114
All right, look, I get it, okay?

00:30:14.848 --> 00:30:19.621
When I heard his voice, it was
like time hadn't passed, but it had.

00:30:19.754 --> 00:30:22.624
I mean 15 years is
a long time to disappear.

00:30:26.827 --> 00:30:28.495
And I miss him.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.932
My mom's like ridiculously smart,
so if there's a clue in that bag,

00:30:32.066 --> 00:30:35.102
she'll find it
and then maybe we'll find him.

00:30:40.974 --> 00:30:42.009
Please?

00:30:45.012 --> 00:30:46.847
All right. Okay.

00:30:47.848 --> 00:30:49.016
I'll get it to you.

00:30:49.149 --> 00:30:51.118
Wonderful. Ready?

00:30:55.557 --> 00:30:57.334
- I know you didn't want me here...
- Not another word.

00:30:57.358 --> 00:30:59.038
- No. Do you see? I helped.
- Ava, stop it.

00:30:59.159 --> 00:31:01.505
- He wouldn't have given it to us if I...
- We will talk about this later.

00:31:01.529 --> 00:31:05.199
Right now, I am so angry I don't trust
anything that would come out of my mouth.

00:31:13.907 --> 00:31:15.909
What can you tell us
about Bobby Romano?

00:31:16.043 --> 00:31:17.746
I've run this place 22 years,

00:31:17.878 --> 00:31:22.015
and I can honestly say I've
never met anyone like Bobby.

00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:23.685
- Is that a good thing?
- Oh, yeah.

00:31:23.818 --> 00:31:26.129
See, a lot of people land here,
they're fresh out of prison.

00:31:26.153 --> 00:31:28.523
They're mad at the world.
They want to burn it all down.

00:31:28.656 --> 00:31:30.190
But not Bobby.

00:31:30.324 --> 00:31:33.193
He dusted himself off and
decided to make the world better.

00:31:33.327 --> 00:31:34.928
With protein powder?

00:31:35.062 --> 00:31:39.233
Okay, yeah, I know it sounds
silly, but Bobby believes in it.

00:31:39.366 --> 00:31:40.401
What's the harm?

00:31:41.001 --> 00:31:44.138
Well, if Bobby felt
so strongly about his business,

00:31:44.271 --> 00:31:46.974
how far do you think
he'd go to protect it?

00:31:48.676 --> 00:31:49.711
What are you asking?

00:31:49.844 --> 00:31:51.378
A woman's been murdered.

00:31:51.513 --> 00:31:53.180
Um, Tori Nolan.

00:31:53.313 --> 00:31:55.583
She and Bobby had a bit of a
past. Do you know that name?

00:31:55.717 --> 00:31:58.653
Bobby mentioned Tori a few
times when he first got here,

00:31:58.787 --> 00:32:01.455
said that she actually helped
put him in prison,

00:32:01.589 --> 00:32:02.956
but he wasn't angry about it.

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:05.926
Like I said, Bobby left all
that behind when he got out.

00:32:06.393 --> 00:32:08.696
But then she threatened him.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:11.150
- He told us she called him.
- -Oh, she did more than that.

00:32:11.666 --> 00:32:12.933
She showed up at his warehouse.

00:32:13.066 --> 00:32:15.837
She said not only
would she ruin his launch,

00:32:15.969 --> 00:32:18.972
but she'd see to it that he
went back to prison for life.

00:32:19.106 --> 00:32:20.374
What did Tori find out?

00:32:22.176 --> 00:32:23.778
Bobby wouldn't say.

00:32:23.912 --> 00:32:26.815
But when he missed his last group
session that morning, I called him.

00:32:27.448 --> 00:32:29.450
He was frantic.

00:32:29.584 --> 00:32:33.755
He said "I should have taken
care of this ten years ago."

00:32:35.422 --> 00:32:38.125
Look, I thought he meant get a
restraining order or something.

00:32:39.259 --> 00:32:40.929
I didn't think he'd hurt her.

00:32:45.834 --> 00:32:48.368
- LAPD.
- Bobby, open the door.

00:33:00.782 --> 00:33:02.717
How long has Bobby been dead?

00:33:02.851 --> 00:33:04.686
ME says a few hours.

00:33:04.819 --> 00:33:07.622
An employee told us that Bobby
was very upset after we spoke with him,

00:33:07.755 --> 00:33:10.035
sent everyone home early
and locked himself in his office.

00:33:10.157 --> 00:33:13.427
And we're guessing that's where he
swallowed enough pills to overdose?

00:33:13.561 --> 00:33:14.662
- Mm-hmm.
- What'd he take?

00:33:14.796 --> 00:33:17.397
It's a new party drug called Dazzle Kitty.

00:33:17.532 --> 00:33:21.134
It's a euphoria inducing stimulant
like ecstasy, but five times more potent.

00:33:21.268 --> 00:33:24.137
In large quantities,
it can cause cardiac arrest,

00:33:24.271 --> 00:33:25.916
which we believe
is what happened to Bobby.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.842
The L3 was a cover
for shipping the drugs.

00:33:27.976 --> 00:33:30.110
We found bags of it
hidden in the powder canisters.

00:33:31.211 --> 00:33:34.014
Now, most of these are real companies
just purchasing protein powder,

00:33:34.147 --> 00:33:35.683
but this code, 44889,

00:33:35.817 --> 00:33:37.962
corresponds to the orders that
had bags of drugs in the powder.

00:33:37.986 --> 00:33:40.296
We assume they're being trafficked
to distributors around the country.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:44.792
We also found a .380 pistol in his desk
that matches the gunshot wounds on Tori.

00:33:44.926 --> 00:33:47.566
- We're sending to ballistics for testing.
- -Beef and barley soup!

00:33:50.899 --> 00:33:52.332
Beef and barley soup.

00:33:52.901 --> 00:33:54.941
Saying it again doesn't
make it any clearer, Morgan.

00:33:55.035 --> 00:33:58.673
Somebody wants us to think that
Bobby killed Tori and then OD'd.

00:33:58.806 --> 00:34:00.784
- But you don't buy it.
- No, when we were here earlier,

00:34:00.808 --> 00:34:02.342
Bobby couldn't wait to show us around.

00:34:02.476 --> 00:34:04.788
Now he's not the brightest
bulb, but even he's smart enough

00:34:04.812 --> 00:34:07.549
to not want cops digging around
in a place where there's drugs.

00:34:07.682 --> 00:34:09.717
- Plus, the soup.
- Soup?

00:34:09.851 --> 00:34:11.629
I opened his mouth
and I smelled inside of it,

00:34:11.653 --> 00:34:13.653
and it definitely smells
like beef and barley soup.

00:34:13.688 --> 00:34:15.365
And he dribbled a little bit on his T-shirt.

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:17.001
You can see it there.
That wasn't there before.

00:34:17.025 --> 00:34:19.961
This guy ate the soup and
died right around the same time.

00:34:20.093 --> 00:34:22.030
- Okay?
- There's no soup container.

00:34:22.162 --> 00:34:23.722
We checked all the trash cans, nothing.

00:34:23.765 --> 00:34:25.733
We also checked the sink drain.

00:34:29.904 --> 00:34:31.806
Is that -A carrot?

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.842
Mm-hmm. And a half-melted
capsule of Dazzle Kitty.

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:38.947
<i>So, either Bobby drugged
his own soup, ate it,</i>

00:34:39.079 --> 00:34:41.783
<i>and then high as a kite,
dumped the rest down the drain,</i>

00:34:41.916 --> 00:34:44.919
<i>magicked the container
away before passing out.</i>

00:34:45.553 --> 00:34:48.322
- Or.
- Or someone else put the drug in the soup.

00:34:48.455 --> 00:34:49.924
And that someone wants us to think

00:34:50.058 --> 00:34:52.618
that the drug operation and Tori's
murder were all Bobby's doing.

00:34:52.694 --> 00:34:54.596
And now that he's dead,
it's a closed case.

00:34:54.729 --> 00:34:56.965
Yes. I think whoever
killed Bobby also killed Tori

00:34:57.097 --> 00:34:58.417
and masterminded the whole thing.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:34:59.968
Then who's the brains?

00:35:19.787 --> 00:35:21.789
- Freeze!
- Hands up!

00:35:21.923 --> 00:35:24.424
Gavin Tillman, get out of
the vehicle with your hands up.

00:35:38.573 --> 00:35:40.742
I hope you're curious how
we found out about this,

00:35:40.875 --> 00:35:42.635
'cause I've been pretty excited to tell you.

00:35:42.744 --> 00:35:44.622
At first, we thought,
"Oh, for sure, it's Lamar."

00:35:44.646 --> 00:35:46.924
Yeah, we brought him in for questioning,
but he wouldn't give anything up.

00:35:46.948 --> 00:35:48.950
He's loyal, isn't he? I'll give him that.

00:35:49.083 --> 00:35:51.052
But Bobby didn't get the same courtesy.

00:35:51.184 --> 00:35:53.855
Lamar was very quick to tell
us that he met Bobby in prison,

00:35:53.988 --> 00:35:57.357
and Bobby brought him
into his L3 drug operation.

00:35:57.491 --> 00:36:00.828
See, the problem there is that
neither of those things are true.

00:36:00.962 --> 00:36:02.806
A, Bobby had no idea
there was a drug operation,

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:04.670
and B, they weren't in prison
at the same time.

00:36:04.799 --> 00:36:06.500
They sure weren't.

00:36:06.634 --> 00:36:10.370
After they got out, they spent time
at your halfway house, Serenity Arms.

00:36:10.938 --> 00:36:13.541
Once we made that connection,
Lamar was much more cooperative.

00:36:13.675 --> 00:36:15.442
<i>Oh, yeah, he gave you right up.</i>

00:36:15.576 --> 00:36:17.955
Yeah, but Lamar insisted he had
nothing to do with Tori and Bobby's deaths,

00:36:17.979 --> 00:36:19.781
and he had the alibis to prove it.

00:36:19.914 --> 00:36:22.874
He sure did. No, that was all you. But
you were honest with Karadec and Oz.

00:36:24.351 --> 00:36:26.151
Bobby did tell you
about Tori in his sessions,

00:36:26.186 --> 00:36:28.455
<i>and Bobby did talk to you
about Tori's threats.</i>

00:36:28.589 --> 00:36:31.391
<i>Bobby had no idea what Tori
was talking about, but you did.</i>

00:36:31.526 --> 00:36:34.095
Tori reaching out
to Bobby blew her cover.

00:36:34.227 --> 00:36:35.471
You knew exactly where to find her.

00:36:35.495 --> 00:36:37.532
<i>So, you waited at Cloud House,</i>

00:36:37.665 --> 00:36:39.585
<i>and when Tori's car came
into view, you shot her.</i>

00:36:41.069 --> 00:36:42.513
<i>You couldn't have predicted
the state she'd be in,</i>

00:36:42.537 --> 00:36:44.172
<i>but you just used it to your advantage.</i>

00:36:44.304 --> 00:36:45.873
At that point, Bobby was a liability.

00:36:46.007 --> 00:36:48.647
Lamar said he called you right
after we showed up to the warehouse.

00:36:49.342 --> 00:36:51.378
<i>You needed to tie up loose ends.</i>

00:36:52.547 --> 00:36:55.187
<i>When we talked to you at the halfway
house, Bobby was already dead.</i>

00:36:56.383 --> 00:36:58.385
- I want a lawyer.
- Oh, I bet you do.

00:36:58.519 --> 00:36:59.854
Maybe more than one.

00:36:59.987 --> 00:37:01.589
Go deep on that bench.

00:37:05.193 --> 00:37:06.928
<i>Spoke to the editor</i>
<i>of</i> Takedown Magazine.

00:37:07.061 --> 00:37:09.931
They're gonna finish Tori's last
article and put out a tribute issue.

00:37:10.064 --> 00:37:11.398
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

00:37:11.532 --> 00:37:14.367
Aw, I like that. The world
needs more Toris in it.

00:37:14.869 --> 00:37:16.170
Yeah.

00:37:16.303 --> 00:37:18.281
I'm gonna get out of here
before the captain ambushes me.

00:37:18.305 --> 00:37:20.373
You know, you can't avoid him forever.

00:37:20.508 --> 00:37:21.776
Um. I have owed

00:37:21.909 --> 00:37:25.713
the Culver City Public Library
$3.50 since the '90s,

00:37:25.847 --> 00:37:28.281
so, I'm gonna beg to differ.

00:37:28.415 --> 00:37:31.886
Mmm. You know there's always some growing
pains when a new person joins a team.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.554
There is?

00:37:34.222 --> 00:37:37.658
I remember nothing but absolute
delight when I came on board.

00:37:38.458 --> 00:37:39.493
Oh.

00:37:40.228 --> 00:37:41.394
See ya.

00:37:52.707 --> 00:37:54.407
Hey, you need some help?

00:37:54.542 --> 00:37:55.576
No, I'm good.

00:37:56.544 --> 00:37:58.780
She just needs some coolant
or she gets cranky.

00:37:58.913 --> 00:38:01.616
Not cranky, assertive.

00:38:01.749 --> 00:38:03.709
I thought you were
gonna come by for a chat today.

00:38:04.152 --> 00:38:06.988
Nah, I made that up to buy
some time so I could get out of it.

00:38:07.121 --> 00:38:08.890
Plus, I was busy,
you know, doing my job.

00:38:09.023 --> 00:38:10.658
Yeah, you like working here.

00:38:12.226 --> 00:38:15.630
- Is that a question?
- No, that's a surprised observation.

00:38:15.763 --> 00:38:17.443
- Why surprised?
- I just heard some rumors

00:38:17.532 --> 00:38:21.269
you don't respond positively to authority.

00:38:22.703 --> 00:38:26.507
I don't respond positively to
authority that abuses their power.

00:38:26.641 --> 00:38:27.809
Is that how you see me?

00:38:27.942 --> 00:38:29.476
I don't know.

00:38:31.012 --> 00:38:32.379
I haven't decided on that yet.

00:38:32.513 --> 00:38:35.149
Well, what have you decided on?

00:38:35.283 --> 00:38:37.051
Um

00:38:37.185 --> 00:38:40.288
I've decided I'd like you
to get your car out of my way

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.722
so I can go home to my kids.

00:38:41.856 --> 00:38:43.591
All right, Gillory.

00:38:44.992 --> 00:38:46.027
Let me have it.

00:38:50.497 --> 00:38:53.000
All right Let's see.

00:38:53.935 --> 00:38:55.703
You're from a legacy family, right?

00:38:55.837 --> 00:38:58.306
So, that tells me you
could take the easy road,

00:38:58.438 --> 00:39:01.474
but you choose not to because you
want to prove to everybody that you can.

00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:04.879
And that's admirable,
but it also makes you smug.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:09.684
You like being captain. You
like the respect, like the authority.

00:39:09.817 --> 00:39:10.818
Love the boots.

00:39:10.952 --> 00:39:12.392
But you also miss being in the field

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.280
a little bit more than
you thought you would.

00:39:14.387 --> 00:39:17.307
You like to be in the action, right?
'Cause that makes you feel important.

00:39:17.859 --> 00:39:18.893
Anything else?

00:39:20.294 --> 00:39:21.329
Mm-hmm.

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:25.967
You like to keep people guessing
if your interest in them is real

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:28.302
or just a way to get something you want.

00:39:29.337 --> 00:39:30.370
Pretty good.

00:39:31.873 --> 00:39:33.608
You got two out of the three.

00:39:33.741 --> 00:39:35.843
Oh, yeah? Which one did I get wrong?

00:39:41.082 --> 00:39:43.450
I'm not as good at this game as you are.

00:39:47.154 --> 00:39:48.990
But I've learned one thing for sure.

00:39:50.057 --> 00:39:52.026
You give Morgan Gillory a puzzle,

00:39:52.159 --> 00:39:54.862
she won't stop thinking
about it until it's solved.

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:03.304
Good night, Morgan.

00:40:18.586 --> 00:40:19.620
Hey.

00:40:21.155 --> 00:40:22.223
Hey.

00:40:24.592 --> 00:40:25.960
You're still mad.

00:40:28.229 --> 00:40:31.032
Yeah, I am.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.520
I love you more than
anything in this world,

00:40:34.635 --> 00:40:37.772
so I'm gonna do whatever I need
to do to keep you safe.

00:40:37.905 --> 00:40:40.574
If I say no to you, I expect you to listen.

00:40:40.708 --> 00:40:42.843
- But nothing bad happened.
- That's not the point.

00:40:42.977 --> 00:40:46.113
I told you no, and you went off and
did whatever you wanted to do anyway.

00:40:46.247 --> 00:40:48.616
- Sounds familiar.
- Excuse me?

00:40:48.749 --> 00:40:51.385
If you don't agree with
someone, you never listen to them.

00:40:51.519 --> 00:40:53.921
What would you have done
if you were me?

00:40:54.055 --> 00:40:55.823
- Yeah, exactly.
- Ava.

00:40:57.457 --> 00:41:01.562
You're not wrong, okay?
The difference is I am an adult.

00:41:02.296 --> 00:41:05.199
- I get to make those choices. You don't.
- You're such a hypocrite.

00:41:05.333 --> 00:41:08.333
Okay, I'm glad the SAT prep is paying
off, but let's watch the tone, please.

00:41:08.436 --> 00:41:09.971
I'm serious. You're being unfair.

00:41:10.104 --> 00:41:12.840
I'm being your mom. Ava, I
make mistakes all the time.

00:41:12.974 --> 00:41:14.208
This isn't one of them, okay?

00:41:14.342 --> 00:41:16.510
- And actions have consequences.
- What does that mean?

00:41:16.644 --> 00:41:19.044
It means I need to think about
how much I want to involve you

00:41:19.146 --> 00:41:21.191
in the stuff with your dad
until I can trust you again.

00:41:21.215 --> 00:41:23.684
You're never gonna trust me
enough because you don't want to.

00:41:23.818 --> 00:41:25.896
I'm sorry, trust is something
that you earn from a p...

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.155
No, stop. You think you're
some cool mom or something,

00:41:28.289 --> 00:41:29.729
but you're really just embarrassing.
