Is Li Xu's interrogation setup ready?

All set. You want to handle it?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.840
I'll take it.

Fell from that height,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.800
I thought you'd be dead or crippled.

Disappointed?

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.190
Not really.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.950
Since you're alive,

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.910
I'll go easy.

Alright.

You've thought things through.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.720
If that's the case,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.480
let's have a proper talk.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.560
Maybe you'll get off lighter.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.680
I'll confess.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.720
I took people to beat Wang Li.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.120
We had beef.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.310
He owed me money.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.950
I beat him,

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:46.920
but nobody died.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.290
A few days inside, that's it.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.310
I overrated you.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.270
Let me remind you.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.720
Last Thursday,

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.920
you, Zhang Ming, and Wang Li

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.830
were all at Hongyun.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.120
What were you doing?

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.120
What did you talk about?

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.120
Wang Li was handing the restaurant to me.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.480
My people have already moved in.

No. Just us.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.960
What about him?.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.830
Take a good look.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.950
I told you. I don't know him.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.070
Stop bluffing

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.390
and acting like a grownup.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.310
You know what he did?

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.270
I said I don't know him.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.510
What he did is none of my business.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.830
He's a big deal.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.560
The main culprit in the Naked Banquet Case

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.120
and Liu Yan's case.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.830
On the run for over ten years.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.720
Multiple deaths on him.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.920
And now you're tied to him.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.120
You think we have no evidence?

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.270
If you say nothing,

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.390
that's harboring.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.270
He's facing the death penalty.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.270
You?

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.760
Well,

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:17.950
I suggest

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.190
you appreciate that I'm sitting here,

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.680
talking to you nicely.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.750
I want to see Officer Tang.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.480
Officer Tang!

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.960
Stop yelling.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.820
(Tang Tang: I'll interrogate Wang Li.)

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.040
You say we know each other.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.000
Where's the proof?

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.800
If you've got it, show me.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.190
We don't have

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.830
photos of you together.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.430
But whether Bai

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.720
kept something on you,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.870
that I don't know.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.950
What do fifteen years ago

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.310
have to do with me?

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.000
And that banquet thing.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.950
I know nothing.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.270
Go interrogate him.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.000
You don't want to talk to me?

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:14.470
I...

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.880
Tang Tang.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.830
We've got Bai.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.240
Wrap up and come over.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.080
Okay.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.430
If you don't want to talk, fine.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.000
We've noted everything you said.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.190
I'll ask Bai

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.040
and see how his story differs.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.150
Wait.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.560
What?

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.390
Want to talk again?

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.470
I know him.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.230
Bai.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.120
We first met at my shelter.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.040
He came to me.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.750
The day I fell off,

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.800
what were

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.680
Bai and Wang Li doing?

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.800
They had a conflict.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.000
I went to mediate.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.630
Misunderstanding.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.160
The girl he abducted,

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.120
is she okay?

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.480
Good thing you caught him.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.320
If he'd escaped,

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.040
who knows how many deaths

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:17.710
would have

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.750
ended up on me.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.400
Mediate?

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.310
Nice word.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.150
- No, I...
- Li Xu,

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.870
if you want to talk properly,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.870
think carefully.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.910
I'll talk. Wait.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.080
I'll talk.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.470
Officer.

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.630
I'll confess.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.040
Officer Tang,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.120
have you found Yimo?

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.510
To find her,

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.600
I need Bai first.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.630
Didn't you arrest Li Xu?

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.360
He knows where Bai is.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.720
He doesn't.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.800
Wang Li,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.910
tell me everything you know

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.790
about Bai

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.630
and the Naked Banquet Case.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.510
You want answers?

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.270
Find Wang Yimo first.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.480
She's in real danger.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.440
You aware?

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.150
You know she's in danger,

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.440
and you still dragged her in?

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.390
That's how you're a father?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.840
Tang Tang.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.390
Check this out.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.230
We've got evidence.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.200
This is the DNA comparison

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.600
Captain Zhao ordered earlier.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.620
(Blood residue from the dog's nose
matches Bai Qiming's DNA)

(Get to Zhaojia Village, south side.
Pickup in 3 days.)

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.270
Three days hiding there?

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.960
Those jerks at the Company.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.350
They'd better keep their word.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.260

Stay safe, Wang Yimo.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.630
If you get hurt,

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.030
you'll slow us down.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:10.790
What then?

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.360
Caicai, help her up.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.270
If she falls again,

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.560
you deal with it.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.510
This suspect is extremely dangerous.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:47.320
Ensure the hostage's safety at all costs.

report and close in.

Get people searching here.

Got it.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.040
Bring in the dog.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:33.960
Bai Qiming.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.870
Drop your weapon.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.150
You're surrounded.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:41.670
Don't joke with me.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.360
Wang Yimo

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.510
is in my hands.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:47.440
Give up.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.600
You still have a chance.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.230
Move.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:21.550
Surrender.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.270
You lost.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.920
Tell your people to back off.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.320
Or else,

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.830
I'll kill her.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.070
Easy.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:35.680
Can we talk?

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.640
I won't repeat myself.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.480
You want me to start

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.480
with her eyes

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:46.870
or

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:48.790
her nose?

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:49.790
Okay, okay.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.030
Five steps back.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.480
Bai Qiming,

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.000
she has to live

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.960
for you to bargain.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.720
Do you understand?

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.200
Enough talk.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.950
Let me go.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.680
If I die here today,

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.000
she dies with me.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:24.510
Understand?

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.440
Get me a car.

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:31.590
No problem.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.950
Get him a car.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I got you a car.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.440
Now release her.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.350
I'll take her place.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.640
He wants to trade with you.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:51.110
What do you say?

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.510
Cut the act!

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.830
Think you're better than Huahua?

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:02.950
Tang,

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.030
don't worry about me.

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:06.510
Shoot him.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:07.720
Don't let him go.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.920
Shut up.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:12.590
I'm done wasting time.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.110
Clear a path.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.310
Get the car ready.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.680
If you play tricks,

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:22.880
I kill her.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.750
Don't let him get away, Tang Tang.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.000
The cases you're working on

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.240
are done by me.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.790
Shoot him, Tang Tang!

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.680
Shoot him, Tang Tang!

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:17.100
(People's Police)

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:26.870
Did he confess?

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:27.870
Yes.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.790
According to Li Caicai's testimony,

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.750
after escaping 15 years ago,

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:33.920
Bai smuggled out through Yunnan.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.480
Bai chose this place

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.550
and targeted Wang Li and his daughter

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.110
because Wang Li

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.210
nearly killed him back then.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.440
That hatred never faded,

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.110
especially after seeing

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:47.720
Wang Li's life

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.030
was getting better and better.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.720
He grew more twisted

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.160
and reckless.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.160
Fifteen years ago,

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.590
Wang Li nearly beat Bai to death.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.240
The killer at the scene

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.160
Liu Yan allegedly witnessed

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.110
gotta be Wang Li.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.790
Wang Li was tied to the Naked Banquet.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.310
His accomplices were the kitchen staff.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.720
How's Bai?

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.480
Bai?

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:21.670
No vital injuries.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:23.790
After bandaging, he was fine.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:24.630
He's sent back later.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:10.850
System online.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.110
You haven't had it easy these 15 years.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.680
How's the girl?

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.080
She's fine.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.750
Minor treatment at the hospital.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:40.880
You're confident.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.790
Shooting at me with a hostage.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.440
More ruthless...

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.110
than I am.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.880
You the Naked Banquet

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.640
and coerced so many minors.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.560
Oh right.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.240
We found Liu Xijun's body too.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.000
You did it, right?

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:11.790
I mean,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.110
you ran for so long

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:14.790
and still came back

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.720
to take revenge on the Wangs.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.270
You're the confident one.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.920
They got lucky.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:30.240
I ended up like this

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:32.590
because of them.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.550
If I had

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.200
killed them back then,

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:38.630
none of this would've happened.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:43.350
Ever heard of "reap what you sow"?

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:49.110
We chased this case for 15 years.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:50.870
Bai Qiming,

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.590
you really underestimated the police.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.800
Come on.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.830

The murder of Liu Xijun.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.950
Do you confess?

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:08.440
Liu Xijun?

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.200
He's just bones now.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.350
How will you prove I did it?

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:18.550
He had an asthma attack

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.160
and was caught in a fire.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.640
He brought it on himself.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.590
None of my business.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.210
Also,

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:27.640
you never found

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.070
the banquet venue back then,

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.560
right?

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.000
What about now?

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.440
Found it yet?

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:38.630
Well...

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.400
Everything on your desk

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.350
is just speculation.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.350
You don't have solid proof.

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:47.920
You can't convict me.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.520
You don't confess.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.000
Fine.

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.950
What about Liu Yan?

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.750
She was your accomplice
in the Naked Banquet Case,

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.590
and she witnessed your so-called death.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:12.790
So why was she poisoned
right after you came back?

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.230
That's a hell of a coincidence.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.110
I also heard

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.270
you met her many times

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.030
after returning.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.310
Her death has nothing to do with me.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:28.510
Ask Wang Li.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:29.590
Yes.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.240
You caught him, didn't you?

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.680
Go ask him.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:34.240
You mean

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.070
Wang Li killed Liu Yan?

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.110
Who else could it be?

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.550
Four months ago,

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:46.350
the first person I met after coming back
was Liu Yan.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:50.160
I sent her to provoke Wang Li on purpose.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.270
Back then we all fell apart,

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.400
he was the only one who walked away clean.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.160
Lived comfortably for over ten years.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.240
Took zero responsibility.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:13.960

she was useful.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:31.270
But she's gone.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.800

No.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.280
He's still alive.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.480
Tang Tang, look at this.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.550
Thank god Yimo's safe.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:15.430
Thank you.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:17.590
We found Zhang Ming.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.590
We went to Hongyun

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:22.000
to look for Zhang Ming,

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:25.320
but it ended up with a surprise.

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:30.000
The second-floor mirror.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.150
The Naked Banquet hall.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.480
What did Zhang Ming say?

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.110
He's still unconscious.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.590
From the first time I met you,

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.920
every time we spoke,

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.400
I could tell

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:04.440
you are

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.400
a very capable cop.

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:10.760
And I can tell

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:13.800
the day the truth comes out

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.070
is very close.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.960
Every case will be exposed.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.440
Every hidden truth

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.920
will be revealed.

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:39.960
I'll cooperate.

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:41.710
I'll tell you everything.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.280
I was the cook

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.880
for the Naked Banquet.

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:49.360
This knife

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:51.960
was the one Bai used

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.840
to kill Liu Xijun.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.190
Why did he kill him?

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.320
There were candles that night.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.070
One tipped over and started a fire.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.400
Chaos.

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:12.110
Liu Xijun had an asthma attack.

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:14.630
He collapsed and couldn't move.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:20.000
Bai didn't want the venue exposed

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.960
and

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.550
he owed Liu Xijun a lot of money.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.510
So he used the fire to silence him.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.800
Why did you kill Bai?

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.960
My daughter

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:37.030
had leukemia.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:39.000
She was in the ICU.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:40.590
We need a lot of money.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:42.590
Bai promised

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:43.510
to pay me.

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:45.960
So I could save my daughter.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.710
But he didn't.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.670
He delayed her treatment.

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:52.000
Without the money, my daughter died.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:54.760
So I had to kill him.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.760
Your real daughter

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.550
died of illness 15 years ago.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.280
Wang Yimo

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.960
is Huahua,
one of the Naked Banquet victims.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.030
How did you become her father?

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.480
After my daughter died,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
I was heartbroken.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.000
Even if Bai died,

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.320
my daughter wouldn't come back.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:41.510
Then I saw Huahua.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.240
I thought

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:49.360
this was heaven giving me another chance.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.360
A chance

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:54.800
to be a father again.

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:01.390
Officer Tang,

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:05.590
I treated Huahua as my own child.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.510
I would never let her touch crime.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:09.600
Never let her break the law.

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:10.920
So,

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.590
everything was me.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.320
Did you kill Liu Yan?

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:20.400
Yes.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:26.070
Yimo is Huahua.

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:29.070
Liu Yan threatened me.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.710
She wanted money or she'd spill everything.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.280
She was working with Bai.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.590
I couldn't let her talk.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.110
I couldn't let her hurt Yimo.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.800
So I killed her.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.150
How?

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.480
Poisoned sausage from the dog thieves.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.230
That's how she died.

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:21.920
The chaos caused by the dog thefts,

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:23.960
I was behind it.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:25.510
I wanted you

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:27.230
to notice the shelters.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.030
To notice Bai.

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:32.030
If you already killed Liu Yan,

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.840
why not kill Bai too?

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:38.590
End it once and for all.

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:41.190
From what I know,

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.480
after Bai came back,

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:45.840
you two met,

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.760
and many times afterward.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.000
You had chances.

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:53.440
Why be ruthless with Liu Yan,

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:55.760
but hesitate with Bai?

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:57.590
Killing isn't that easy.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.070
You know what Bai was like.

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:03.840
He was far more dangerous than Liu Yan.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.550
If I failed,

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.880
Yimo and I would be dead.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.190
So I waited.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.630
I wasn't unwilling.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:16.470
Before I could,

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.590
you guys stepped in.

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:32.590
Your car?

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:34.710
Blood on it.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.120
You hit someone?

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.920
Yes. That's my car.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:38.880
I hit a man.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.440
But he seemed fine.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.030
Are you sure?

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.510
Clear enough?

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:52.920
You were driving.

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:54.320
Yimo was in the passenger seat.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.640
What?

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.760
You hit someone and fled?

00:40:58.270 --> 00:40:59.110
Here's what happened.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.150
I was driving.

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.920
After I hit him, I got out of the car.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.110
I helped him up.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.880
I offered to take him to the hospital.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.510
He said he was fine

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:07.710
and walked away.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.960
That's all.

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.070
At this point,

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.710
you're already sitting here.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.400
There's no point

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:17.760
hiding anything.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.630
I understand.

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:22.550
I admit the killings.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:24.360
Yimo is safe.

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.630
I'm ready to pay

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:27.470
for what I did.

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:29.230
It's the price I owe.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:30.550
I accept it.

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:37.030
I find Wang Li's confession strange.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:40.440
Since the dog thieves named Zhang Ming,

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.760
Wang Li's been

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.070
our main suspect.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.960
But today,

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.230
he confessed immediately.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:48.070
Too eager.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.920
What about Zhang Ming?

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:53.030
He confessed.

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.720
The dog thieves acted on Wang Li's orders.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.110
And 15 years ago, under Wang Li's direction,

00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:58.320
he and Xu Qiang

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.000
(Interrogated: Zhang Ming)
worked as cooks for the banquet.

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:01.070
He followed Wang Li

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:02.190
for money

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:03.630
to pay his mother's medical bills.

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.990
Dad?

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.280
Yimo.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.440
No matter how upset, you have to eat.

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:42.360
Your dad's car

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.880
has been impounded.

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:48.150
That day

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.400
can't be hidden anymore.

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:55.800
Knowing your dad,

00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:59.710
he'll take everything on himself.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.280
Yimo,

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.920
before the police uncover everything,

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:10.000
I'll take you away.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.280
Yimo.

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:51.390
Ms. Tong.

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:54.550
You were born in winter.

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:02.760
My dad got you a birthday gift.

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:09.550
He can't give it to you anymore,

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.670
so I'm giving it early.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.230
At least, it eases his heart.

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:20.000
Bai Qiming's been caught.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.000
No one's threatening you now.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:25.840
Ms. Tong,

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:30.710
I can't get away.

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:33.230
But you still can.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.110
You never should've been dragged into this.

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:07.940
(Repent and Reform)

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:25.500
(Yimo)

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:30.380
(Yimo)

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.710
Stop moping and sighing.

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:52.870
Stand up.

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.550
A young, talented detective

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:01.880
with a future ahead.

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:03.710
Who trained you?

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.320
You did.

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:55.180
(Yimo)

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.320
Yimo,

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.760
when you see this video,

00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:09.150
I might

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.400
never be able to be with you again.

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:15.480
But it's okay.

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:19.480
Only if I turn myself in

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.280
will the truth come out.

00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:24.960
Only then can you truly be free.

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:27.760
Yimo,

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:30.480
let the past stay in the past.

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:33.230
Look forward.

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:35.630
In my heart,

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:37.400
my daughter

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:40.670
will always

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.600
be bright

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:44.550
and shining.

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:46.630
You're amazing.

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:49.960
You deserve a better tomorrow.

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:53.000
I will always love you.

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.360
Ride the Ferris wheel with me.

00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:59.840
What did my dad say to you?

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:03.230
Did he say

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.510
he did everything?

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:08.670
He confessed.

00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:18.150
Remember the last time

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:20.550
you met me for coffee,

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:21.960
asking about my dad?

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.230
I told you back then

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:28.110
that he's a good man.

00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:31.920
A truly good man.

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:37.110
Since the day I became his daughter

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:41.880
he never let me suffer even a bit.

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:44.360
He always wanted to protect me.

00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:47.400
Even now,

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:49.590
I've grown up

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:51.400
and made mistakes,

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:53.030
and he's still the same.

00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:00.480
He just wants me to have a future.

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:08.960
But…

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:12.800
I don't deserve it anymore.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:24.840
I'm sorry.

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:27.480
I lied to you.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.840
Zhang Ming and the dog thieves' handler

00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:34.070
was me.

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:38.320
I put myself in danger again and again.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.320
I dragged you into this mess

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.800
to get Bai on your radar.

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.320
Back on the Shopping Street,

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:47.880
you saw me call Zhang Ming.

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:49.400
It was because I knew

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:52.590
once the two dog thieves were arrested,

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.110
they'd give up Zhang Ming.

00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:56.070
So I called to warn him.

00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:59.550
Later Zhang Ming got used by Bai

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.320
and nearly dragged my dad down.

00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:06.760
I wanted to kill him.

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:12.110
My dad went soft

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:14.030
and spared him.

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:16.840
He couldn't die.

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:18.550
Dad.

00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:27.350
Ming.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:29.840
Ming.

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.590
I won't kill you.

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:35.800
But,

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.590
you have to disappear for a while.

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:40.510
When it's all over,

00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:41.690
I'll come back and let you go.

00:53:42.110 --> 00:53:44.670
If the police come for you,

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:46.030
you tell them

00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:47.230
that everything

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:50.150
was done by me.

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:51.680
Understood?

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:54.840
I'll take care of your mother.

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.000
For life.

00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:58.600
I'll see her through

00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:01.440
to the end.

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:13.440
And Liu Yan.

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:17.280
I killed her too.

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:27.700
(Welcome to Hongyun Restaurant)

00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:29.740
(Hongyun Restaurant)

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:35.990
Who is it?

00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:37.280
Hello, ma'am.

00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:43.020
(Volunteer)

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:47.760
Hi, ma'am.

00:54:48.110 --> 00:54:49.320
I'm a community volunteer.

00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:50.800
I brought you some supplies.

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.030
Rice, flour, things like that.

00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:53.630
Volunteer?

00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:56.840
It's not a holiday. Why bring this?

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.110
School program.

00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:59.630
We coordinated with the community.

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:00.880
Just take it.

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:01.850
If you need more,

00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:03.070
I'll bring'em next time.

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:05.030
Next time?

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:06.150
Well, that'd be nice.

00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:07.190
Put them there.

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:08.670
I'll leave'em on the table.

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:10.670
It's lunch time.

00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:12.000
Perfect timing.

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:13.550
So this is your lunch?

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.150
I actually brought my own.

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:16.670
If you don't mind,

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:17.760
we could share.

00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:19.430
Sure.

00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:21.190
But if you eat here,

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.710
you clean up after.

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:23.680
No problem.

00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:26.760
Does it suit your taste?

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:29.550
Quite a spread.

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:32.000
Here. Chopsticks.

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.480
Eat more.

00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:35.800
And there's sausage too.

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:39.280
Here.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.400
I'll clean up later.

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:42.320
Okay.

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.440
We never had volunteers
bringing food before.

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.070
What's your name, girl?

00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:53.110
Wang Yimo.

00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:55.390
My nickname

00:55:58.760 --> 00:55:59.600
is Huahua.

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:09.680
My dad

00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:11.070
is Wang Li.

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:12.590
He runs a restaurant.

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.280
Hongyun.

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:25.400
You're the little girl

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:27.710
I sent away back then.

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:29.910
Yeah.

00:56:31.070 --> 00:56:32.550
You're the one who sent me.

00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:34.480
Remember now?

00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:38.480
Ma'am, don't stand.

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.480
Eat a bit more.

00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:40.600
I'd say

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.030
three to four minutes.

00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:44.800
Three or four minutes?

00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:46.480
What do you mean?

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:50.280
See? You just wasted another minute.

00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:02.590
You'll feel the poison slowly.

00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:03.630
The pain it brings.

00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:06.070
Dying like this

00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:09.230
is mercy from heaven.

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:11.590
You know exactly

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:13.920
what you've done.

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:18.800
The man Wang Li hit with his car.

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.710
What did you do with him?

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:26.960
We burned him.

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.880
Do you know who he was?

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.240
He was one of the businessmen

00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:46.480
at the Naked Banquet.

00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:52.710
I'll never forget

00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:54.710
his filthy eyes.

00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:57.760
My Huahua…

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.150
I'll play with you.

00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:03.320
It was pure coincidence.

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.030
He jumped out like a ghost.

00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:08.280
Like he was reminding me

00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:14.230
I'll never escape

00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:17.400
that nightmare.

00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:29.030
After he was hit,

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:31.490
he wasn't going to live anyway.

00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:35.440
I wanted to finish him myself.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.360
But my dad stopped me.

00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.550
He couldn't bear
to see blood on my hands.

00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:55.280
I forced my dad to kill him.

00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.200
Tang Tang.

00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:02.510
It's all because of me.

00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:12.550
Huahua.

00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:20.470
I'm sorry.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.110
If I'd stopped Liu Yan
from taking you back then…

00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:29.880
if I'd been brave like you,

00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:33.880
standing up every time,

00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.230
none of this

00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:40.800
would've happened.

00:59:53.710 --> 00:59:54.800
Don't be stupid.

00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:58.510
Back then you were a kid too.

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.110
You couldn't stop anything.

01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:07.800
I've hated a lot of people.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.280
But never you.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.630
So when the Ferris wheel reaches the top,

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.960
you really can see the whole city.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.840
Life is strange sometimes.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.510
If it weren't for Liu Yan,

01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:44.840
I wouldn't have met my dad.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.150
He saved me

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.160
at my darkest moment.

01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:57.670
He was a beam of light in my life.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.590
He gave me a second life.

01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:05.800
Now, because of me,

01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:07.150
he took it all on himself

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.880
and fell back into the dark.

01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:15.480
And I don't deserve to stay in the light.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.320
Hello, Dad.

01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:28.510
I'm doing fine.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.710
Work's going great.

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.730
My supervisor's offering me
a permanent position.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.320
Yes.

01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:39.590
I'm eating. Drinking water.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.070
Don't worry.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.710
I'll take good care of myself.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.630
Okay. You go ahead.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.280
Bye.
