WEBVTT

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:29.129
Pa, we have
something to tell you.

00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:30.907
Well—

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:32.674
Pa, Via and I are together.

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:43.977
Wait, Via.

00:00:44.352 --> 00:00:45.728
What about my hug?

00:00:46.336 --> 00:00:47.504
- Via, come on.
- Just message me.

00:00:47.504 --> 00:00:48.776
Okay, I’m heading out.

00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:51.662
Why can’t he just like me back?

00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:54.672
Is she talking about Arkin?

00:00:57.132 --> 00:00:58.801
- Oh my gosh!
- I’m sorry!

00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:00.553
What the heck!

00:01:00.553 --> 00:01:02.680
Seriously, we need this
for the next scene.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.889
I’m so sorry.

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:07.265
You need to look fine.

00:01:07.852 --> 00:01:10.521
If you’re not okay,
then Arkin’s not okay.

00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:11.856
Thanks.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.985
That’s why I’m here, right?
To keep you company.

00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:39.151
What more do you want?
Haven’t I done everything?

00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:41.737
You call that everything?

00:02:41.737 --> 00:02:43.197
All of it, everything—

00:02:43.197 --> 00:02:44.991
So that’s everything now, huh?

00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:47.118
Do you think that’s enough?

00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:49.745
I don’t get you.

00:02:51.622 --> 00:02:52.623
You’re so deep.

00:02:53.218 --> 00:02:55.179
Can’t you just
tell it to me straight?

00:02:56.544 --> 00:02:58.170
Have some mercy on me.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.843
That’s not in the script.

00:03:03.843 --> 00:03:05.511
Why? I just wanted to kiss you.

00:03:05.758 --> 00:03:07.969
You were so cute twirling around.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.789
I didn’t do that.

00:03:09.816 --> 00:03:11.068
- How’d you do it?
- I don’t wanna.

00:03:11.851 --> 00:03:13.644
I didn’t do that!

00:03:14.145 --> 00:03:16.022
Just sit, Kino!

00:03:16.731 --> 00:03:18.649
What were you even doing?

00:03:20.947 --> 00:03:21.948
Oh my gosh.

00:03:24.196 --> 00:03:25.197
Kino?

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.991
Yeah?

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:29.744
How much is your talent fee?

00:03:31.158 --> 00:03:32.409
Why are you asking?

00:03:36.498 --> 00:03:37.659
Because...

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.012
there’s an event at our college,

00:03:40.037 --> 00:03:41.621
and our organization is handling it.

00:03:41.922 --> 00:03:43.674
I thought maybe...

00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:46.385
we could invite you.

00:03:46.681 --> 00:03:49.638
They keep
mentioning your name.

00:03:50.473 --> 00:03:52.058
You’ve got a lot of fans there.

00:03:52.058 --> 00:03:53.434
But it’s just a small event, okay?

00:03:53.434 --> 00:03:55.644
And this is only an inquiry.

00:03:56.437 --> 00:03:58.189
All right, I’ll talk to my manager.

00:03:58.216 --> 00:04:00.135
I’ll say I’ll do it for free.

00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:02.902
Huh? For free?

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.320
Why?

00:04:04.737 --> 00:04:05.488
Don’t do it for free.

00:04:05.488 --> 00:04:10.618
Members of the org might wonder
how we invited you for free.

00:04:10.618 --> 00:04:11.619
So don’t.

00:04:13.996 --> 00:04:14.997
What do we do then?

00:04:16.082 --> 00:04:17.541
Okay, let’s do this instead.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.727
Tell them I’m doing
someone a favor,

00:04:21.253 --> 00:04:23.881
and let’s limit the
performance to two songs.

00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:24.757
Okay?

00:04:24.757 --> 00:04:27.259
So there won’t be
any questions. Is that okay?

00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:30.262
Okay.

00:04:31.064 --> 00:04:33.650
Sure, I think they’ll
agree with two songs.

00:04:33.675 --> 00:04:34.676
All right then.

00:04:36.268 --> 00:04:38.854
By the way, are you sleeping here?

00:04:41.565 --> 00:04:43.275
Yeah. You’re sleeping here.

00:04:45.444 --> 00:04:47.488
Are you coming with us
to volleyball this weekend?

00:04:48.114 --> 00:04:50.658
Yeah. Yanna and Sevi
will be there, right?

00:04:53.494 --> 00:04:55.121
Wait, the snacks—

00:04:56.038 --> 00:04:56.831
Where are you going?

00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:57.623
Huh?

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:59.250
Kino!

00:05:01.794 --> 00:05:02.795
Kino.

00:05:03.546 --> 00:05:04.547
Okay.

00:05:22.064 --> 00:05:23.068
Via?

00:05:23.154 --> 00:05:25.115
Your heart’s beating so fast.
Are you okay?

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:29.217
Kino, are you going to do
something to me?

00:05:30.364 --> 00:05:31.699
Wow.

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:33.752
Is that really how you see me?

00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:37.663
I’m just saying… I’m being serious.

00:05:37.663 --> 00:05:41.459
I just want to know so…
so I’m aware, so…

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:43.210
so I’m prepared,
so I’m ready if—

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.420
Ready for what?

00:05:44.587 --> 00:05:45.588
Huh?

00:05:46.172 --> 00:05:48.799
For that, you know. For—

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:51.510
- You know what I mean.
- For sex?

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.512
- Huh? Kino!
- Via!

00:05:54.638 --> 00:05:57.224
I’m just saying, Kino, because—

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:59.685
I’m actually okay with it.

00:05:59.685 --> 00:06:01.312
I’ve been thinking
about it for a while now,

00:06:01.312 --> 00:06:02.980
it’s just so I know…

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.233
Just so I can prepare,
so I’m ready, like that.

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:07.318
Just…

00:06:07.318 --> 00:06:09.904
Just so I know.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.240
What? What’s so funny?

00:06:14.992 --> 00:06:15.993
I’m sorry.

00:06:16.623 --> 00:06:18.083
You just look cute.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.353
I’m serious, though.

00:06:20.861 --> 00:06:22.362
I’m really serious.

00:06:24.376 --> 00:06:25.377
Come here.

00:06:38.474 --> 00:06:40.184
Don’t worry.

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:41.945
I’m not in a rush.

00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:51.612
Are you okay—

00:06:51.612 --> 00:06:53.781
- Kino?
- Yeah. Let’s sleep.

00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:55.491
Huh? Does it hurt?

00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:57.618
- I’m just going to the bathroom.
- Are you okay?

00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:19.666
Girls, you go ahead.

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:23.227
My car still isn’t here.
It might take too long.

00:07:23.227 --> 00:07:24.728
So what? If it takes too long,

00:07:24.728 --> 00:07:26.397
it’s fine, we’ve got plenty of time.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.149
Hey Sam, thanks
for taking Avi out.

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:32.111
Of course. It’s fun
spoiling my godchild.

00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:34.280
Oh my gosh, you’ve all
spoiled Avi so much.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.282
Even Sevi and Arkin
were easily dragged

00:07:36.307 --> 00:07:39.633
by Avi to buy her ice cream.

00:07:39.657 --> 00:07:40.658
That’s fine.

00:07:46.292 --> 00:07:47.293
Hey, Via!

00:07:48.794 --> 00:07:49.795
What?

00:07:49.795 --> 00:07:50.921
I just…

00:07:52.214 --> 00:07:54.149
I just wanted to ask
you both something.

00:07:57.386 --> 00:07:58.887
How do you do…

00:08:00.055 --> 00:08:01.056
that?

00:08:02.224 --> 00:08:03.225
That?

00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:06.189
That… you know.

00:08:06.937 --> 00:08:07.938
Huh?

00:08:09.815 --> 00:08:12.610
You know… That.

00:08:14.028 --> 00:08:17.114
Like what couples do and stuff.

00:08:17.615 --> 00:08:18.616
That.

00:08:19.867 --> 00:08:21.201
You mean sex?

00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:22.161
Huh?

00:08:22.828 --> 00:08:24.204
- Sam!
- Damn!

00:08:24.204 --> 00:08:27.541
It’s weird when it’s two
of your friends doing it, huh?

00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:29.585
I can’t imagine it.

00:08:30.753 --> 00:08:31.754
How do I explain this?

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.635
Have you watched any
videos or none at all?

00:08:38.844 --> 00:08:39.845
None at all.

00:08:40.554 --> 00:08:44.391
Wait, how far have things
gone between you two?

00:08:49.355 --> 00:08:54.652
Just making out, and
we sleep next to each other.

00:08:54.652 --> 00:08:58.864
But just next to each other,
and we really go to sleep.

00:08:58.864 --> 00:09:02.534
- Just sleeping.
- Just sleeping? You two are so innocent.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.621
Here’s the thing…

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.248
Watch some videos.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.209
For research purposes.

00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:12.002
- Yeah, research.
- Yeah.

00:09:12.336 --> 00:09:13.796
I’ll send you some links, okay?

00:09:15.172 --> 00:09:16.465
I’ll recommend
something to you.

00:09:16.674 --> 00:09:18.634
So you can learn something.

00:09:18.634 --> 00:09:22.846
Look, Hiro was really good.
We ended up having Avi.

00:09:22.994 --> 00:09:23.995
Yanna!

00:09:24.359 --> 00:09:25.360
Yanna.

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:26.793
Oh, I’m sorry, so sorry.

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:28.060
Nothing like that.

00:09:28.644 --> 00:09:30.521
So how often are
you supposed to do it?

00:09:30.521 --> 00:09:32.481
How often do you guys do it?

00:09:33.816 --> 00:09:35.484
- What about you, Sam?
- And you, Sam?

00:09:35.484 --> 00:09:37.277
How often do you
and Clyden do it?

00:09:37.653 --> 00:09:41.323
Well, when we
weren’t that busy—

00:09:41.657 --> 00:09:44.284
We used to do it
around five times a week.

00:09:44.284 --> 00:09:45.577
- There you go.
- Five times a week?

00:09:45.577 --> 00:09:46.745
- Why so many?
- Five times.

00:09:47.663 --> 00:09:48.872
That’s a lot.

00:09:48.872 --> 00:09:49.873
It’s not a lot!

00:09:50.582 --> 00:09:52.584
Wow, you all have experience.

00:09:52.584 --> 00:09:54.044
I’m the only one who doesn’t.

00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:58.674
Via, you don’t have to
feel pressured about it.

00:09:59.174 --> 00:10:01.953
It’s okay to take your
time until you’re ready.

00:10:02.088 --> 00:10:04.946
What matters is that
both you and Arkin

00:10:04.972 --> 00:10:06.765
have a great first time.

00:10:08.058 --> 00:10:09.226
- Right?
- Correct.

00:10:09.226 --> 00:10:12.187
Oh, here. I’ll give this to you.

00:10:14.898 --> 00:10:15.607
Here.

00:10:15.607 --> 00:10:18.068
- Here, you’ll need it.
- This girl is prepared.

00:10:18.068 --> 00:10:19.653
It’s better to be prepared.

00:10:20.154 --> 00:10:22.197
I just don’t know Arkin’s size.

00:10:22.197 --> 00:10:24.074
But you can handle it.
I’m sure that’ll fit.

00:10:24.074 --> 00:10:25.066
There you go.

00:10:32.105 --> 00:10:33.523
What is this?

00:10:33.548 --> 00:10:35.550
What’s wrong? That’s normal.

00:10:35.586 --> 00:10:37.838
You know we really should be safe

00:10:37.838 --> 00:10:39.798
and enjoy ourselves
at the same time.

00:10:39.798 --> 00:10:41.508
- Yes!
- Yeah!

00:10:41.508 --> 00:10:43.677
- Hey, keep us updated, okay?
- Yeah.

00:10:43.677 --> 00:10:45.095
Oh my gosh, my car is here.

00:10:45.095 --> 00:10:46.096
- Your car is here.
- Yeah.

00:10:46.096 --> 00:10:48.265
- Okay, you go ahead.
- Yes, okay.

00:10:48.265 --> 00:10:49.266
I’ll see you later.

00:10:49.266 --> 00:10:51.310
Update me on what happens.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.437
You can use both or just one.

00:10:53.437 --> 00:10:54.480
- Okay?
- Huh?

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.774
- I’ll send you the best one, okay?
- Oh my gosh, I forgot.

00:10:58.192 --> 00:10:59.985
- Bye!
- Bye, take care.

00:10:59.985 --> 00:11:01.320
Enjoy!

00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:04.198
What, do you want a tutorial?

00:11:04.198 --> 00:11:05.908
Not you too! Yanna!

00:11:05.908 --> 00:11:09.369
Come on, just to make sure
your first time goes well.

00:11:12.498 --> 00:11:16.001
So, for Monday’s schedule,
we have our food fest.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.088
Guys, I already talked
to Larkin Sanchez.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.591
He’ll be at our event tomorrow.

00:11:23.926 --> 00:11:25.969
Really? How did you talk to him?

00:11:27.012 --> 00:11:28.013
I—

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:31.809
I talked to someone
who knows him.

00:11:31.809 --> 00:11:34.102
I was just hoping, and
luckily they answered.

00:11:34.102 --> 00:11:37.439
Really? Larkin Sanchez?
Seriously?

00:11:38.357 --> 00:11:39.942
Yeah, but...

00:11:40.526 --> 00:11:44.112
is it okay if he only
performs two songs?

00:11:44.112 --> 00:11:46.365
He’s just asking for a
token of appreciation,

00:11:46.365 --> 00:11:47.533
even without a talent fee,

00:11:47.533 --> 00:11:49.910
since he’s doing
someone here a favor.

00:11:50.244 --> 00:11:51.787
I just don’t know who it is.

00:11:52.371 --> 00:11:56.542
Girl, even just a “hi”
would’ve been enough.

00:11:57.209 --> 00:12:00.754
But who do you think
he’s doing the favor for?

00:12:00.754 --> 00:12:02.756
Could it be a relative here?

00:12:03.173 --> 00:12:05.717
Or maybe a relative of Clea?

00:12:08.178 --> 00:12:10.848
Speaking of, have you
guys seen that interview?

00:12:11.448 --> 00:12:12.432
Huh? What interview?

00:12:12.432 --> 00:12:15.644
Arkin lowkey admitted that
he and Clea are a thing!

00:12:15.644 --> 00:12:17.896
Oh my god. Who’s that?

00:12:17.896 --> 00:12:19.022
- Where?
- Interview?

00:12:19.523 --> 00:12:21.149
Wait, here. Let’s watch it.

00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:22.693
Okay, let me see.

00:12:24.528 --> 00:12:27.656
So, Arkin, what’s the real
deal between you and Clea?

00:12:27.656 --> 00:12:29.700
I’m sure a lot of
your fans are curious.

00:12:31.869 --> 00:12:35.205
Well, I can say that our
relationship is very special to me,

00:12:35.205 --> 00:12:36.582
and to her as well.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.252
We are really good partners,
and we work well together.

00:12:41.017 --> 00:12:43.589
So, are you guys official now?

00:12:48.427 --> 00:12:51.763
You should ask Clea about that.
She knows the answer.

00:12:52.556 --> 00:12:56.238
So juicy! Stay tuned, guys,
and we’ll ask Clea

00:12:56.263 --> 00:12:57.931
if they really are a couple.

00:13:01.159 --> 00:13:05.444
Also, Clea posted this
after the interview.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.665
Via, tell them to have Clea join in.

00:13:12.454 --> 00:13:13.660
Just kidding.

00:13:14.734 --> 00:13:15.735
I’ll be right back.

00:13:17.493 --> 00:13:19.036
Come on guys, back to work.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.341
Okay guys, let’s organize the
stuff we need to print, okay?

00:13:24.129 --> 00:13:25.213
- Okay.
- Okay, let’s move.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.896
He didn’t tell me about this.

00:13:32.516 --> 00:13:34.574
Sorry. I really need to talk to someone
about this. #arclea

00:13:35.327 --> 00:13:37.288
Are they really just workmates?

00:13:37.892 --> 00:13:42.272
Everyone knows Clea doesn’t
like fan service, so that means—

00:13:42.541 --> 00:13:46.462
Maybe it’s not true, but let
me be delulu for a moment.

00:13:46.487 --> 00:13:48.364
They’re really cute!

00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:49.446
They’re totally a thing!

00:13:49.446 --> 00:13:51.239
I saw them having lunch together.

00:13:51.239 --> 00:13:53.200
There wasn’t even a shoot.

00:13:58.279 --> 00:14:01.407
I’m gullible anyway,
just let me believe they’re real.

00:14:01.432 --> 00:14:03.226
Can they just get together.

00:14:03.251 --> 00:14:05.711
Just let us have this.

00:14:17.683 --> 00:14:20.352
“Blind Item: Who is the love
team whose kissing scenes

00:14:20.352 --> 00:14:22.729
are allegedly starting
to become real?”

00:14:28.424 --> 00:14:30.801
Via, Larkin’s here!

00:14:32.926 --> 00:14:33.949
Hi.

00:14:34.939 --> 00:14:35.801
Here’s your food, Via.

00:14:35.826 --> 00:14:36.853
Thanks.

00:14:37.411 --> 00:14:40.622
Larkin, Via is the one
who contacted you.

00:14:40.622 --> 00:14:42.874
She’s also the one who’ll
guide you during the sound check.

00:14:42.874 --> 00:14:44.059
Okay.

00:14:44.084 --> 00:14:45.819
Via! Nice to meet you.

00:14:50.298 --> 00:14:51.550
Nice to meet you.

00:14:54.594 --> 00:14:56.096
Thanks, Larkin.

00:14:56.096 --> 00:14:57.973
I still can’t believe this.

00:14:58.181 --> 00:14:59.850
Okay, I’ll leave you
guys for now.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.351
I’ll leave him to you, Via.

00:15:01.893 --> 00:15:03.395
Sure, thanks.

00:15:15.323 --> 00:15:17.659
Take out your guitar so
we can set things up.

00:15:29.671 --> 00:15:31.465
Also, take that off for now,

00:15:32.213 --> 00:15:35.409
in case anyone sees it.
They might notice.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.722
You guys made it official, right?

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:40.182
You and—

00:15:40.307 --> 00:15:41.391
Via, I’m sorry.

00:15:43.591 --> 00:15:46.317
I didn’t know they were going
to announce it yesterday.

00:15:46.605 --> 00:15:49.524
I was supposed to tell you after this.

00:15:50.105 --> 00:15:51.815
Let’s not talk about it here.

00:15:53.695 --> 00:15:54.696
I’m sorry.

00:15:58.909 --> 00:15:59.910
Via?

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.252
Via, can you come with me?
Let's check the tech booth.

00:16:09.753 --> 00:16:11.963
Sir Arkin, please excuse us.

00:16:12.589 --> 00:16:13.632
- No problem.
- Sure.

00:16:21.765 --> 00:16:25.352
All right! Let’s not
wait any longer.

00:16:25.352 --> 00:16:28.563
Let us welcome our
guest of honor tonight,

00:16:28.563 --> 00:16:31.608
the one and only
Larkin Sanchez!

00:16:48.881 --> 00:16:50.925
Hi everyone, this is Larkin Sanchez.

00:16:51.478 --> 00:16:53.396
Wow, right? I really got
invited to your school,

00:16:53.421 --> 00:16:54.840
your budget is huge!

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.930
Nah, I’m kidding.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.304
I have a friend, and
I’m doing them a favor.

00:17:02.013 --> 00:17:03.431
So make sure to thank them.

00:17:04.432 --> 00:17:07.269
So, I know you’re busy
with your studies

00:17:07.269 --> 00:17:09.146
and your deadlines,

00:17:10.188 --> 00:17:12.315
but I’m happy to
entertain you tonight.

00:17:13.108 --> 00:17:14.818
So, for my first song,

00:17:15.902 --> 00:17:18.822
this is actually the very
first song I ever wrote.

00:17:19.322 --> 00:17:21.199
I don’t know if
you’ve heard it before,

00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:23.034
but this is The Golden Scenery.

00:17:23.577 --> 00:17:24.828
I hope you like it.

Yeah.

00:19:31.792 --> 00:19:34.544
Wait. That looks heavy.

00:19:34.582 --> 00:19:35.500
No, it’s fine.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.293
No, I’ll carry it.

00:19:36.293 --> 00:19:38.003
No. I got it. Hold on.

00:19:38.991 --> 00:19:40.993
- Via, does it hurt? Are you okay?
- Huh?

00:19:41.506 --> 00:19:42.799
No, I’m fine. Yeah.

00:19:42.976 --> 00:19:43.977
It’s nothing.

00:19:44.634 --> 00:19:45.635
Nothing?

00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:48.722
Does it hurt?

00:19:48.972 --> 00:19:49.973
No.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:09.000
Are you okay?

00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:10.076
Yeah.

00:20:18.793 --> 00:20:19.794
Let’s go, Via.

00:20:20.462 --> 00:20:21.504
Who is that, Via?

00:20:21.713 --> 00:20:22.714
- Huh?
- Let’s go.

00:20:34.726 --> 00:20:36.478
Kino, what are you doing?
Let go of me!

00:20:37.354 --> 00:20:38.438
What? Does it hurt?

00:20:38.772 --> 00:20:40.190
Are you mad?

00:20:40.341 --> 00:20:42.218
Does it hurt because
you’re jealous?

00:20:42.692 --> 00:20:44.861
Huh? Say it. What?

00:20:44.861 --> 00:20:45.904
Via, please—

00:20:45.904 --> 00:20:46.905
That’s actually good.

00:20:46.905 --> 00:20:48.907
It hurts, right?
Good that you feel it,

00:20:48.907 --> 00:20:51.242
so you have some
idea of how I feel.

00:20:51.242 --> 00:20:54.913
But Kino, what I’m feeling
hurts way more.

00:20:55.163 --> 00:20:56.761
Avianna, hear me out, okay?

00:20:56.786 --> 00:20:59.664
You can’t just pull me
like that, Kino.

00:20:59.709 --> 00:21:01.461
You’re not thinking,
you’re not careful.

00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:02.337
Look at yourself?

00:21:02.337 --> 00:21:04.172
What if someone
recognizes you again?

00:21:04.672 --> 00:21:06.709
You just do whatever you want!

00:21:06.925 --> 00:21:08.051
You don’t think about me.

00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:09.344
You don’t think
about how I feel.

00:21:09.344 --> 00:21:10.595
You don’t think
about how I’m doing.

00:21:10.595 --> 00:21:13.890
You don’t think about
what I want to happen!

00:21:15.361 --> 00:21:16.779
I’m not mad, Via, okay?

00:21:16.893 --> 00:21:17.946
I’m sorry.

00:21:19.336 --> 00:21:20.838
I’m really sorry about the news.

00:21:21.189 --> 00:21:23.191
So what, you’re together now?

00:21:24.256 --> 00:21:26.675
You’re going to say in
interviews that you’re a couple?

00:21:26.736 --> 00:21:28.696
You’re going to tell everyone?

00:21:30.326 --> 00:21:32.911
I have to, okay? Via, I have to.

00:21:33.326 --> 00:21:36.246
I didn’t know they were
going to release it yesterday.

00:21:38.498 --> 00:21:40.125
You know this already.

00:21:41.167 --> 00:21:42.502
Orders from the management.

00:21:42.502 --> 00:21:44.170
- I really can’t do anything.
- Fine! Okay, fine!

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.215
Okay, management.
But what happens now?

00:21:50.552 --> 00:21:51.636
What happens now?

00:21:51.636 --> 00:21:53.179
Are you going to act
like you’re together?

00:21:53.721 --> 00:21:58.143
You’ll go out, go on dates,
be sweet, hug, kiss, like that?

00:21:58.143 --> 00:21:59.185
So whatever we do,

00:21:59.185 --> 00:22:00.812
you’re going to do
with her, too, is that it?

00:22:03.451 --> 00:22:04.958
This is all just work.

00:22:04.983 --> 00:22:06.317
You know—

00:22:06.317 --> 00:22:08.319
You know you’re
the one I love, right?

00:22:08.903 --> 00:22:11.322
I’m sorry you got dragged
into this situation.

00:22:12.282 --> 00:22:13.867
Via, I’d understand if—

00:22:15.076 --> 00:22:17.162
you can’t support me
on this anymore.

00:22:22.167 --> 00:22:23.168
No, Kino.

00:22:28.465 --> 00:22:29.924
I want to support you.

00:22:29.924 --> 00:22:32.969
I really, really want to support you.

00:22:33.803 --> 00:22:36.264
I promised you, didn’t I?
So even if—

00:22:37.515 --> 00:22:40.101
Even if this breaks me, even
if I get hurt by this.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.773
It’s okay. I’ll endure it.

00:22:46.746 --> 00:22:48.039
I can handle it.

00:22:51.138 --> 00:22:52.718
Because Kino, I love you.

00:22:57.181 --> 00:22:58.266
Via.

00:23:03.082 --> 00:23:04.083
I’ll go back in.

00:23:05.837 --> 00:23:07.036
Via, I’m sorry.

00:23:12.884 --> 00:23:14.719
That’s just how it is.

00:23:38.868 --> 00:23:41.579
“ArClea: From Reel to Real”

00:23:41.579 --> 00:23:45.542
“ArClea Confirms
They Are Together.”

00:23:45.542 --> 00:23:48.628
“The Nation’s Favorite Love Team.
Now Officially In Love.”

00:23:48.628 --> 00:23:50.221
Finally, they admitted it!

00:23:50.259 --> 00:23:52.564
Some good news in the Philippines!

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:54.884
Wedding announcement when?

00:23:54.926 --> 00:23:58.990
If these two break up,
I won’t believe in forever anymore!

00:23:59.015 --> 00:24:01.685
I’ve never shipped
a couple this hard.

00:24:02.301 --> 00:24:04.452
My ArClea heart is so happy right now!

00:24:04.477 --> 00:24:07.313
Guess I’m swooning over
someone else’s love life again.

00:24:08.077 --> 00:24:09.732
You really agreed to this?

00:24:10.034 --> 00:24:12.203
This feels like way
too much publicity.

00:24:12.569 --> 00:24:14.028
I mean, they’re already famous.

00:24:14.028 --> 00:24:16.406
They don’t even need this.
So annoying.

00:24:16.406 --> 00:24:19.826
Their new series is about to air,

00:24:19.826 --> 00:24:22.829
so they said they
need more online buzz.

00:24:24.455 --> 00:24:25.290
Look at this.

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:28.042
They want us to hype up
their announcement.

00:24:28.418 --> 00:24:30.893
Via, I can’t do it.

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:33.840
Honestly, it’s fine even if I get
kicked out of the group chat.

00:24:34.799 --> 00:24:36.009
Just let it be.

00:24:37.302 --> 00:24:40.471
But you, are you okay?

00:24:41.761 --> 00:24:42.762
How are you?

00:24:43.558 --> 00:24:44.559
I’m fine.

00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:47.736
And Kino already told me
about it anyway.

00:24:48.438 --> 00:24:50.047
I already know
what’s going to happen.

00:24:50.819 --> 00:24:53.280
Really? You’re not pretending?

00:24:56.154 --> 00:24:59.449
Of course, there’s a bit of pain.

00:24:59.945 --> 00:25:01.446
A bit of jealousy.

00:25:02.327 --> 00:25:04.162
But what can I do?

00:25:04.709 --> 00:25:06.544
I know what’s real.

00:25:08.104 --> 00:25:12.191
And I promised Kino I’d
support him in his work.

00:25:12.378 --> 00:25:16.424
And if what’s happening now
is better for his career,

00:25:16.424 --> 00:25:18.134
why would I be against it, right?

00:25:18.968 --> 00:25:19.969
That’s true.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.639
But I’ll still support you, okay?

00:25:23.139 --> 00:25:24.307
I still won’t hype it up,

00:25:24.307 --> 00:25:26.476
even if they kick me
out of the group chat.

00:25:28.936 --> 00:25:30.229
Thank you, Luna.

00:25:31.397 --> 00:25:32.565
Do you want to just
go out for drinks?

00:25:32.732 --> 00:25:34.233
Let’s just drink, come on!

00:25:34.817 --> 00:25:37.654
Huh? Maybe next time,

00:25:37.654 --> 00:25:39.822
I still need to do groceries.

00:25:40.573 --> 00:25:44.035
But Luna, don’t worry.

00:25:45.286 --> 00:25:47.258
I’m really okay, I promise.

00:25:47.853 --> 00:25:48.854
Thank you.

00:25:51.793 --> 00:25:53.127
Okay then.

00:25:55.505 --> 00:25:56.923
Should I just be
a basher instead?

00:26:00.051 --> 00:26:01.678
So annoying.

00:26:26.744 --> 00:26:27.758
Via.

00:26:33.334 --> 00:26:34.335
Kino.

00:26:37.964 --> 00:26:40.007
I wish you told me
you were coming.

00:26:40.591 --> 00:26:42.343
Good thing we ran into each other.

00:26:43.136 --> 00:26:44.303
I’ve been waiting here
for a while.

00:26:44.303 --> 00:26:45.430
I just wanted to see you.

00:26:46.013 --> 00:26:47.849
So, do you have anything
to do right now?

00:26:48.241 --> 00:26:49.784
Just grocery shopping.

00:26:49.809 --> 00:26:51.144
Come on, I’ll go with you.

00:26:51.602 --> 00:26:52.478
Really?

00:26:52.478 --> 00:26:53.479
Let’s go.

00:27:00.612 --> 00:27:03.611
Here, Via. This is just for
research purposes only.

00:27:03.636 --> 00:27:05.988
You’re not really
supposed to copy this.

00:27:06.013 --> 00:27:09.850
It’s unrealistic. But at least
you’ll have an idea, right?

00:27:09.875 --> 00:27:12.961
Oh my gosh, Yanna. But thanks.

00:27:12.986 --> 00:27:16.907
Just message me if you
still have more questions.

00:27:21.048 --> 00:27:23.760
What matters is that
both you and Arkin

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.511
have a great first time.

00:27:25.511 --> 00:27:29.265
Here. I’ll give this to you.
It’s better to be prepared.

00:27:30.641 --> 00:27:32.176
Why are you just
staring off like that?

00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:34.979
You look like you’re
thinking really deeply.

00:27:37.807 --> 00:27:38.925
How are you?

00:27:41.944 --> 00:27:42.945
Huh?

00:27:44.043 --> 00:27:45.836
Why are you asking that?

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:55.541
They announced earlier that
Clea and I are officially together.

00:27:56.167 --> 00:27:57.335
Are you okay?

00:28:35.142 --> 00:28:37.544
Shit, did I lock the door?

00:28:37.569 --> 00:28:40.321
Papa’s not going to knock, right?

00:28:50.067 --> 00:28:51.068
Via?

00:28:52.174 --> 00:28:53.175
Huh?

00:28:56.018 --> 00:28:57.770
I told you before, didn’t I,

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.524
that I’d support you in everything
you do, so I’m okay.

00:29:01.923 --> 00:29:02.924
I’m okay.

00:29:04.168 --> 00:29:07.212
I only love you. You know that, right?

00:29:20.616 --> 00:29:21.617
Kino.

00:29:28.153 --> 00:29:29.529
I love you.

00:29:37.411 --> 00:29:40.289
Oh my god. Is this it?

00:29:59.874 --> 00:30:01.028
Why did you stop?

00:30:03.162 --> 00:30:04.997
Can you still breathe?

00:30:24.758 --> 00:30:25.759
Kino—

00:30:27.145 --> 00:30:28.184
Oh my god. Is this it?

00:30:28.332 --> 00:30:29.917
Are we going to do it?

00:30:39.241 --> 00:30:41.594
I’m not ready. What do I do?

00:30:44.982 --> 00:30:46.359
What are you getting?

00:30:47.692 --> 00:30:49.184
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:30:49.209 --> 00:30:51.807
Give it back—

00:30:51.833 --> 00:30:52.834
Kino!

00:31:01.826 --> 00:31:03.702
No. No, no, that’s not mine.

00:31:03.727 --> 00:31:04.937
That’s Clyden’s.

00:31:06.105 --> 00:31:07.106
Clyden?

00:31:10.115 --> 00:31:13.077
Wow. You’re trying to take
Sam’s boyfriend now?

00:31:13.224 --> 00:31:15.726
No. It’s Sam and Clyden’s.

00:31:15.773 --> 00:31:17.567
Sam just gave it to me
because it was for us,

00:31:17.592 --> 00:31:20.595
just in case… just in case…
if it happens to us—

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.371
You don’t need to explain.

00:31:23.247 --> 00:31:24.386
You’re so cute.

00:31:35.605 --> 00:31:37.024
Love you.

00:31:37.884 --> 00:31:39.010
Love you.

00:31:58.657 --> 00:31:59.658
Via—

00:31:59.992 --> 00:32:01.160
Are you okay?

00:32:01.185 --> 00:32:02.895
Or are you already drunk?

00:32:03.445 --> 00:32:04.660
Huh?

00:32:04.705 --> 00:32:06.874
I’m sorry. I was just thinking
about what happened

00:32:06.874 --> 00:32:08.042
between me and Kino last night.

00:32:09.319 --> 00:32:10.653
Oh my gosh. You had sex?

00:32:11.295 --> 00:32:13.091
- Oh my gosh!
- Sam—

00:32:13.116 --> 00:32:14.458
- Oh my gosh!
- Sam!

00:32:15.224 --> 00:32:17.568
Via, did you use the
condoms I gave you?

00:32:17.593 --> 00:32:19.303
Sam! You’re too loud.

00:32:19.303 --> 00:32:20.888
- Huh? What? No!
- No, no.

00:32:20.888 --> 00:32:24.424
- Tell me the details.
- No, I don’t even know because—

00:32:24.714 --> 00:32:26.382
No, I don’t know
how it even happens.

00:32:27.142 --> 00:32:29.346
How do you do it?
How do you start?

00:32:29.503 --> 00:32:31.714
Is there a sign?
A signal or something?

00:32:32.404 --> 00:32:34.156
Via, don’t overthink it.

00:32:34.181 --> 00:32:37.059
It’ll just happen when
it’s meant to happen.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:39.053
You don't have to rush.

00:32:39.078 --> 00:32:41.371
But you know, so you can
learn stuff like that,

00:32:41.396 --> 00:32:42.940
let’s call Yanna!

00:32:42.965 --> 00:32:46.030
So you’ll know the basics,
the positions.

00:32:46.055 --> 00:32:47.056
Even just stuff like that.

00:32:47.081 --> 00:32:50.167
I met Ely because we had
common friends at a party.

00:32:50.192 --> 00:32:52.903
A player and an actor,
so she followed me.

00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:54.347
What, are you jealous now?

00:32:54.372 --> 00:32:55.373
Is that my fault?

00:32:56.105 --> 00:32:57.982
Jealous? Moron!

00:32:58.572 --> 00:33:00.604
With a face like this,
I’m more handsome than you.

00:33:00.985 --> 00:33:02.570
- Well?
- What face?

00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:04.589
Let me see. You look like a ladle.

00:33:05.057 --> 00:33:05.766
Asshole.

00:33:05.766 --> 00:33:07.810
That’s why you’re cooking, huh.

00:33:08.936 --> 00:33:09.561
Wait.

00:33:09.586 --> 00:33:10.920
Is that Adi?

00:33:11.342 --> 00:33:14.137
Oh, he’s here.
Maybe I should tell Zorel.

00:33:15.335 --> 00:33:16.336
Zorel?

00:33:17.532 --> 00:33:18.533
Clea.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.670
Aren’t you related, Sam?

00:33:20.864 --> 00:33:24.308
Yeah. Related like second
cousins or something.

00:33:24.333 --> 00:33:25.293
But we’re friends.

00:33:25.752 --> 00:33:28.922
And I still can’t believe
she agreed to do that

00:33:28.947 --> 00:33:31.199
whole dating thing with you.

00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:35.276
Well, she probably has a deal
with the management.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.947
I’m not allowed to say anything.

00:33:37.696 --> 00:33:40.449
Well, it’s weird because
that’s another deducted point

00:33:40.474 --> 00:33:42.226
for her crush.

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:44.921
Who?

00:33:46.133 --> 00:33:48.885
I think it’s that football player, right?

00:33:51.757 --> 00:33:53.801
Clea has a crush on someone?

00:33:54.119 --> 00:33:55.832
So she’s just like Arkin.

00:33:55.857 --> 00:33:58.484
Isn’t he friends with Kalix?

00:33:59.111 --> 00:34:01.113
Maybe he’s here. Let’s go check.

00:34:01.113 --> 00:34:03.282
Then we’ll take a picture
with him and send it to Luna.

00:34:03.814 --> 00:34:05.894
Don’t be silly! And don’t
even try to interfere.

00:34:05.919 --> 00:34:08.296
Good thing Luna stayed
back at the condo.

00:34:09.406 --> 00:34:10.407
Yeah.

00:34:11.333 --> 00:34:12.334
- Hi!
- Hi.

00:34:12.359 --> 00:34:13.902
- Hi!
- Hi.

00:34:15.415 --> 00:34:16.875
Hello, hi!

00:34:17.477 --> 00:34:18.462
Oh my gosh.

00:34:18.797 --> 00:34:19.840
Zorel!

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.841
- Hi!
- Hi.

00:34:22.184 --> 00:34:25.980
You’re here.
You know what, I saw Adi.

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:27.598
He’s over there!

00:34:33.624 --> 00:34:34.625
Okay, thank you.

00:34:35.245 --> 00:34:36.246
Clea!

00:34:37.956 --> 00:34:38.957
Hi, Arkin.

00:34:39.216 --> 00:34:40.634
- I’ll see you later.
- Yeah.

00:34:46.333 --> 00:34:47.835
- Cheers?
- Cheers, dude.

00:34:49.286 --> 00:34:50.746
With me, cheers everybody!

00:34:50.746 --> 00:34:52.164
Come on, Sev.

00:34:52.164 --> 00:34:52.790
Cheers, cheers.

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.208
Cheers! You’re too far.

00:34:59.648 --> 00:35:01.233
Why did you send me
that message?

00:35:01.258 --> 00:35:02.551
What message?

00:35:03.581 --> 00:35:05.583
You rejected me
again through text.

00:35:07.048 --> 00:35:08.466
What do you want me to do?

00:35:09.398 --> 00:35:11.901
I told you to come talk
to me in person.

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:17.847
Okay. Fine.

00:35:19.127 --> 00:35:21.379
I’m sorry, but I don’t like you, Zo.

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:24.822
Is it because of the news?

00:35:25.382 --> 00:35:28.081
‘Cause that was nothing,
I swear. Adi.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:29.970
It’s not about the news.

00:35:30.944 --> 00:35:32.862
I just don’t wanna be
in your spotlight.

00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:35.738
So, just leave me alone.

00:35:37.509 --> 00:35:39.678
Okay? Are we done here?

00:36:02.147 --> 00:36:04.010
- Shot!
- Shot!

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:09.580
They already made a toast.

00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:18.810
Love, what happened?

00:36:20.878 --> 00:36:23.505
Huh? Nothing, nothing at all.

00:36:25.402 --> 00:36:27.404
I wasn’t supposed
to hear that,

00:36:27.429 --> 00:36:29.187
which is why
I don’t want to tell anyone.

00:36:29.212 --> 00:36:31.756
I respect Clea’s privacy.

00:36:36.262 --> 00:36:37.263
What?

00:36:37.288 --> 00:36:38.914
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:36:41.617 --> 00:36:43.285
Did Clea do something to you?

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:44.367
Why do you look like that?

00:36:45.306 --> 00:36:46.307
It’s nothing.

00:36:46.922 --> 00:36:48.422
I’m fine.

00:36:48.863 --> 00:36:50.267
Just keep drinking.

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:07.471
Hello, babe?

00:37:10.227 --> 00:37:11.687
Are you really okay?

00:37:11.747 --> 00:37:13.415
You suddenly got quiet.

00:37:13.774 --> 00:37:14.775
Okay.

00:37:17.154 --> 00:37:18.739
Don’t worry, I’m fine.

00:37:19.386 --> 00:37:20.970
I’m fine, don’t worry about it.

00:37:22.277 --> 00:37:23.195
Okay.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.073
All right.

00:37:27.494 --> 00:37:28.495
I’ll head out first, okay?

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.022
I still have somewhere to go.

00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:31.757
Oh, perfect. Via and I are
heading home, too.

00:37:31.782 --> 00:37:33.283
She looks sleepy.

00:37:33.754 --> 00:37:35.464
Yeah, I guess I’ll go home too.

00:37:35.769 --> 00:37:37.479
- Let’s go?
- Come on, let’s go.

00:37:41.819 --> 00:37:42.820
Okay.

00:37:53.081 --> 00:37:54.749
Gosh, it’s still so early.

00:37:54.774 --> 00:37:56.484
Oh my gosh! Is that Larkin?

00:37:56.509 --> 00:37:58.344
- Hey, it really is Larkin!
- Oh my gosh!

00:37:58.789 --> 00:38:00.874
Oh. Hi! Hello, hello.

00:38:00.899 --> 00:38:02.792
Oh my god. It’s Larkin.

00:38:02.817 --> 00:38:04.665
- Can we take a photo with you?
- Sure. A picture?

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:05.649
Oh my god!

00:38:05.649 --> 00:38:07.109
Oh my god, oh my god.

00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:08.151
Let’s do it.

00:38:09.444 --> 00:38:10.571
Oh my god.

00:38:10.571 --> 00:38:11.655
He’s so handsome!

00:38:11.655 --> 00:38:12.739
Oh my god, oh my god.

00:38:14.692 --> 00:38:15.818
Is that Sevi?

00:38:17.077 --> 00:38:18.704
Larkin’s best friend!

00:38:18.729 --> 00:38:20.332
Let’s take a photo with him too!

00:38:20.357 --> 00:38:21.650
It’s hard, right?

00:38:22.759 --> 00:38:24.094
It’s just kind of scary.

00:38:25.177 --> 00:38:26.386
It feels so difficult.

00:38:26.419 --> 00:38:29.506
I just really can’t handle
being in Kino’s spotlight.

00:38:31.276 --> 00:38:33.987
Via, don’t get used
to living with hardship.

00:38:35.611 --> 00:38:37.238
Because it will wear you out.

00:38:37.263 --> 00:38:38.474
Can I get a picture?

00:38:38.499 --> 00:38:39.959
And at some point,

00:38:40.601 --> 00:38:42.686
you’re going to find
yourself giving up.

00:38:45.022 --> 00:38:46.607
By the way, shoutout.
What’s your name?

00:38:46.607 --> 00:38:48.025
Samantha Vera!

00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:49.151
Can I get a picture?

00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:51.862
Shoutout to you, Jed.
Happy birthday.

00:38:54.828 --> 00:38:57.081
Thank you so much.
Oh my god.

00:38:57.106 --> 00:38:58.814
How are you and Clea doing?

00:38:59.358 --> 00:39:00.943
Larkin!

00:39:00.968 --> 00:39:01.927
O, why?

00:39:01.952 --> 00:39:02.931
Can I get a picture with you?

00:39:02.956 --> 00:39:03.874
Of course. Sure.

00:39:03.874 --> 00:39:05.083
Can you please
take a photo of us?

00:39:07.002 --> 00:39:08.003
Thank you.

00:39:08.248 --> 00:39:09.249
Sure.

00:39:10.547 --> 00:39:11.381
Okay.

00:39:11.381 --> 00:39:12.918
Can we get
a video greeting, too?

00:39:19.723 --> 00:39:20.724
He’s so handsome!

00:39:24.561 --> 00:39:25.771
Thank you.

00:39:27.147 --> 00:39:29.107
- Thank you, thank you!
- Thank you.

00:39:31.943 --> 00:39:33.111
Should I take
your picture?

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:37.329
I understand what Adi
said even more now.

00:39:37.664 --> 00:39:39.207
It really is hard.

00:39:39.281 --> 00:39:40.861
I’ve come to realize there
are people like me, too,

00:39:40.886 --> 00:39:44.390
who don’t like putting themselves
out there in front of a lot of people.

00:39:47.851 --> 00:39:49.645
Wow, there are so many people.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:52.631
You mean so many people
being tricked by Arkin.

00:39:56.983 --> 00:39:57.979
Arkin’s something else, huh?

00:39:58.011 --> 00:39:59.012
Everyone’s cheering so loudly.

00:39:59.012 --> 00:40:00.972
Right? There are so
many people already.

00:40:00.997 --> 00:40:01.998
Let’s go.

00:40:02.557 --> 00:40:03.558
One, two, three.

00:40:04.507 --> 00:40:05.508
But Via…

00:40:06.456 --> 00:40:09.334
What about me? This is what I want.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.769
I’m not leaving your side.

00:40:24.298 --> 00:40:26.710
I don’t want to get
caught up in his spotlight.

00:40:26.735 --> 00:40:29.526
I’ll stay standing behind his shadow.

00:41:19.442 --> 00:41:20.527
Pa, Via and I are together.

00:41:20.907 --> 00:41:22.617
She’s my girlfriend. Not Clea.

00:41:22.937 --> 00:41:24.564
Don’t you dare hurt Via.

00:41:24.834 --> 00:41:26.043
I dare you.

00:41:26.252 --> 00:41:27.378
I promise

00:41:28.208 --> 00:41:29.876
I could never do that to Via.

00:41:30.452 --> 00:41:34.206
And Pa, since you’ve accepted
me as your son-in-law,

00:41:34.231 --> 00:41:35.777
I have something for you.

00:41:37.401 --> 00:41:38.736
Son-in-law?

00:41:41.698 --> 00:41:43.992
Pa, alcoholic drink. This is for you.

00:41:45.328 --> 00:41:48.540
So you only brought this
because I gave my blessing?

00:41:48.565 --> 00:41:50.108
I know you
wouldn’t object anyway

00:41:50.133 --> 00:41:53.094
because I know you love me too.

00:41:53.467 --> 00:41:55.886
All right then, let’s drink this now.

00:41:57.902 --> 00:41:58.737
Here you go.

00:41:58.762 --> 00:41:59.763
Thank you.

00:42:02.614 --> 00:42:04.491
This drink you brought
is really good.

00:42:05.526 --> 00:42:07.403
I hope this isn’t too expensive.

00:42:07.891 --> 00:42:10.018
It’s okay, Pa. It’s just once in a while.

00:42:11.585 --> 00:42:12.711
But Pa,

00:42:13.044 --> 00:42:15.589
how did you know
I liked Via even before?

00:42:16.299 --> 00:42:17.717
Please, it was obvious.

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.443
The way you looked at her.

00:42:21.796 --> 00:42:24.591
The way you took care of her,

00:42:24.616 --> 00:42:26.492
and how much you clung to her.

00:42:26.517 --> 00:42:29.312
Especially after her
mom passed away.

00:42:41.812 --> 00:42:42.908
Let’s go?

00:42:44.699 --> 00:42:46.284
I’m just waiting for Papa.

00:42:53.114 --> 00:42:54.037
Are they calling for us?

00:42:54.062 --> 00:42:55.397
Are we the only ones
they’re waiting for?

00:42:57.897 --> 00:42:59.357
Give us a moment.

00:42:59.382 --> 00:43:02.302
And I still need to fix dinner.

00:43:02.327 --> 00:43:04.496
My siblings might be hungry.

00:43:07.484 --> 00:43:11.015
Mama said we should eat
first before we drive you home.

00:43:12.782 --> 00:43:15.993
But we can still stay here if you want.

00:43:17.441 --> 00:43:18.442
No, it’s okay.

00:43:19.843 --> 00:43:22.554
It doesn’t hurt that much,
it’s more like…

00:43:23.359 --> 00:43:24.777
a dull ache.

00:43:26.008 --> 00:43:27.301
Because it hurts.

00:43:28.862 --> 00:43:31.156
You’re not considered weak

00:43:31.516 --> 00:43:33.293
just because you
admit something that hurts.

00:43:55.648 --> 00:43:56.649
It hurts.

00:44:00.818 --> 00:44:02.069
It hurts.

00:44:21.434 --> 00:44:22.852
It’s okay, Via.

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:25.450
I’m here to help you.

00:44:28.264 --> 00:44:29.641
I won’t leave you.

00:44:30.365 --> 00:44:33.702
If you want to
cry right now, go ahead.

00:44:34.968 --> 00:44:36.803
I’ll take care of everything.

00:44:50.239 --> 00:44:51.711
But you know, son,

00:44:52.033 --> 00:44:54.577
I’m happy that you
and Via are together now.

00:44:55.252 --> 00:44:58.088
At least I know she’s in good hands.

00:45:00.773 --> 00:45:02.984
You’re sure about that, Pa?
You can’t take it back.

00:45:03.183 --> 00:45:04.684
Yes, I’m serious.

00:45:05.404 --> 00:45:08.156
I’m happy that you’re
the man she loves.

00:45:08.913 --> 00:45:11.249
And that you never left her.

00:45:11.898 --> 00:45:16.569
So thank you so much
for loving our Via.

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:21.332
I’ve always said
this before, Pa.

00:45:21.977 --> 00:45:23.687
I’m the lucky one with Via.

00:45:24.558 --> 00:45:26.352
I’m the one who’s lucky to have Via, Pa.

00:45:27.042 --> 00:45:28.084
And I promise...

00:45:28.446 --> 00:45:29.947
I won’t leave her.

00:45:38.658 --> 00:45:40.202
This tastes really good.

00:45:40.426 --> 00:45:41.760
That’s strong, Pa.

00:45:41.785 --> 00:45:45.331
Sometimes when I look at Via,

00:45:46.699 --> 00:45:48.063
I think of Ivy.

00:45:50.931 --> 00:45:52.683
She really didn’t like music either.

00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:54.168
Probably because of her mom.

00:45:54.488 --> 00:45:56.198
What do you want to hear?

00:45:56.876 --> 00:45:59.180
That you love me.
You do love me, right?

00:45:59.205 --> 00:46:01.499
If I say yes, what will you do?

00:46:01.861 --> 00:46:05.299
I always knew they would
eventually fall for each other.

00:46:05.324 --> 00:46:06.534
Inseparable.

00:46:06.559 --> 00:46:08.565
You know, there’s nothing
wrong with having a crush.

00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:12.303
I even had a crush
on Via from way back.

00:46:12.739 --> 00:46:14.533
Are you still together
with your boyfriend?

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:20.041
I miss my boyfriend so much.
I really miss him.

00:46:20.163 --> 00:46:24.167
I wonder if he misses me, too.
Does he still love me?

00:46:27.982 --> 00:46:29.900
Happy anniversary, my love.

00:46:37.975 --> 00:46:39.226
Fuck you.
