00:00:01.836 --> 00:00:03.647
You know there's always some growing
pains when a new person joins a team.

00:00:03.671 --> 00:00:07.542
I remember nothing but absolute
delight when I came on board.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.412
You may have heard that I was
up for the captain's chair.

00:00:12.547 --> 00:00:13.691
Turns out you're stuck with me.

00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:15.215
Nick Wagner. Your new captain.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.417
<i>Why are you being so
cool, right now? I hate this.</i>

00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:19.019
<i>I'm pissed. It should have been me.</i>

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:22.155
Root beer on an unprotected
lip? You're a madman.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.658
The stress is getting to her.

00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:26.794
She goes rogue and something
happens She's not a cop.

00:00:26.928 --> 00:00:29.831
- <i>You okay?
- I told you it was - a clean shot. IA will clear me.</i>

00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:32.164
I'm not worried about your
badge. I'm worried about you.

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.737
I just heard some rumors you
don't respond positively to authority.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.616
Sometimes I forget what it's like to
have somebody looking out for me.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.073
See you tomorrow, Gillory.

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:41.776
<i>- Any news?
- We found Roman.</i>

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.745
<i>- Sending a photo.
- That's not Roman.</i>

00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:47.347
Roman asked me to put eyes on you and
Ava, just to make sure you two were okay.

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:49.918
<i>Actually let myself believe
that he didn't abandon us.</i>

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.418
I still believe that.

00:00:51.553 --> 00:00:52.696
<i>Arthur, I want that backpack.</i>

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.360
So, you think that whatever's in that bag

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:57.090
will give you answers
and not just more questions?

00:01:23.651 --> 00:01:26.253
Huh. That's weird. You see that?

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:27.421
Hmm.

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:29.356
It's not coming back.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:30.558
I'ma go check it out.

00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:38.066
All clear so far.

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.816
We good? What's your 20?

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:16.169
Base, we got a guard down.

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.107
- Good morning.
- Morgan, hey, hey. Are you and Ava okay?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.709
Yeah, we're good. What's up?

00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:57.477
I'ma ask you straight up. You
have somebody following me again?

00:02:57.612 --> 00:02:59.179
What? No. What are you talking about?

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.825
I don't know. I think someone's
been on my tail the past few days.

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.584
Maybe it's nothing.

00:03:03.718 --> 00:03:06.718
Arthur, if you feel like you might be
in danger, you should call the police.

00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:08.523
<i>No, I don't think that's a good idea.</i>

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:10.625
<i>Roman wasn't too keen
on the cops, remember?</i>

00:03:10.758 --> 00:03:12.069
What does this have to do with Roman?

00:03:12.093 --> 00:03:13.773
That's what I'm trying to figure out here.

00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:15.663
I mean.

00:03:15.797 --> 00:03:18.757
Were you able to learn anything about
what was inside that backpack of his?

00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:23.104
No, not yet.

00:03:23.905 --> 00:03:27.340
All right, well, look, maybe you
should just hide the bag for now,

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:31.378
'cause whoever Roman's running from might
not want what's inside that bag getting out.

00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:32.680
You hear me?

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.117
Yeah. Hey, I gotta go, okay?

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:40.353
All right, well, look, just be
careful, all right, you and Ava.

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:41.656
<i>Keep your head on a swivel.</i>

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:43.658
You too.

00:03:49.197 --> 00:03:51.474
Ava and I didn't glove up at
home. Is that gonna be a problem?

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:54.602
Only if you think you two might be
suspects in Roman's disappearance.

00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:55.879
I think you can count us out.

00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:57.505
And nothing in the bag look familiar?

00:03:57.638 --> 00:03:59.207
- Rang any bells?
- No.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:01.219
Also, Roman's not a huge fan
of law enforcement,

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:02.886
so if we could just keep this between us.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.746
We'll keep the circle small.

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:05.947
Thank you.

00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:11.351
What's going on?

00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:13.654
Just revisiting an old case.

00:04:16.224 --> 00:04:18.960
Call came in pretty high
profile. I want these two on it.

00:04:19.894 --> 00:04:20.928
Go, I got this.

00:04:22.697 --> 00:04:23.798
And close the door.

00:04:32.907 --> 00:04:34.474
She only arrived here last week.

00:04:34.609 --> 00:04:35.810
She have a name?

00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:37.612
<i>Young Girl Leaning On A Windowsill.</i>

00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:39.923
You guys are saying she a lot. We
are talking about a painting, right?

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:42.083
Painted by Rembrandt in 1645.

00:04:42.216 --> 00:04:45.019
Up until last night, she was
here with our other Dutch masters.

00:04:45.153 --> 00:04:50.024
"This intimate portrait captures the most
fleeting moments of human expression."

00:04:50.158 --> 00:04:51.592
Sorry, I missed it.

00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:53.804
We'll need a list of museum
employees, anyone with access.

00:04:53.828 --> 00:04:57.165
Of course. Then I should call the
Fosters, so they hear it from me.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:58.599
The Fosters?

00:04:58.733 --> 00:05:00.477
Linda and Greg Foster
loaned us the Rembrandt.

00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:02.003
Any idea how much it's worth?

00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:06.439
I believe they paid over 20
million at auction a few years ago.

00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:08.854
- I'll get you that list.
- Thank you.

00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:12.547
Uh, we are Major Crimes, right?

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.782
I'm not really seeing
what's major about this.

00:05:14.916 --> 00:05:17.161
A theft of major artwork carries
a penalty of up to 10 years

00:05:17.185 --> 00:05:20.387
before the DA tacks on possession,
conspiracy, breaking and entering.

00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:22.023
Why? You prefer a dead body?

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:24.692
No, I've just seen actual
missing girls get less attention.

00:05:24.826 --> 00:05:27.336
Well, like it or not, every news
outlet's gonna run with this story tonight.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.640
Captain's probably trying to keep
this from blowing up in our faces.

00:05:29.664 --> 00:05:32.867
One guard said there was too much
smoke for her to get a look at the thief.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.903
Second guard took a blow to the
head, but I hear should be okay.

00:05:36.037 --> 00:05:37.305
So this is our point of entry?

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:39.372
Yeah, and exit as far as we can tell.

00:05:39.507 --> 00:05:42.210
We had whatever this is sent
over to the lab for testing.

00:05:42.777 --> 00:05:44.822
Well, put a rush on the results
and see if we can get a log

00:05:44.846 --> 00:05:46.446
- of visitors the past few weeks.
- Okay.

00:05:47.682 --> 00:05:51.085
So the thief entered here, but the
Rembrandt's all the way over there.

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:54.264
Most thieves prefer not to bust
through the wall like the Kool-Aid Man.

00:05:54.288 --> 00:05:58.526
Okay, so this person took
the time to cut out the window,

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:01.494
<i>toss down a rope, slide down right here.</i>

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.966
And then just walks right by
Vermeer, Caravaggio,

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.203
Turner, Rubens, Delacroix, and Goya?

00:06:09.337 --> 00:06:12.139
Do you have any idea how much
all of those are worth?

00:06:12.273 --> 00:06:13.593
I'm sure you're going to tell me.

00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:15.375
A lot more than the Rembrandt.

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:16.978
If this heist was about money,

00:06:17.111 --> 00:06:19.471
the thief would have taken the
most valuable piece he could.

00:06:24.185 --> 00:06:26.587
<i>Our guy would have known that
this Goya was the real jackpot.</i>

00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:29.023
Maybe they didn't do their research.

00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:31.058
Every single detail
of this thing was planned.

00:06:31.192 --> 00:06:34.929
I mean, look at the frame, that perfectly
straight line down the inside seam.

00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:37.531
Removing this canvas
took precision and time.

00:06:37.665 --> 00:06:39.567
Somebody wanted this painting
for a reason.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.203
Whoever the thief was, they
were not in it for the money.

00:06:42.336 --> 00:06:43.871
This was personal.

00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:45.873
They wanted her.

00:06:49.777 --> 00:06:51.444
Did you say 22 million?

00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:53.991
Yeah, but if Morgan's right, we need
to find out more about the Rembrandt

00:06:54.015 --> 00:06:57.385
to figure out who might have taken
it. And what their real motivation was.

00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:09.297
Excuse me.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.998
Is this Major Crimes?

00:07:11.132 --> 00:07:13.901
You must be Mr. Eastman. I'm
Captain Wagner, we spoke on the phone.

00:07:14.035 --> 00:07:15.836
Of course, please, call me Rhys.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.774
Rhys flew in from Mexico City this
morning to help us find our missing girl.

00:07:19.907 --> 00:07:23.644
Yeah, I had a lead on Kahlo's <i>La
Mesa Herida,</i> but it didn't pan out.

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:26.113
Uh, help us how?

00:07:26.247 --> 00:07:29.951
I'm an art recovery specialist. I
recover lost, missing, or stolen art.

00:07:30.084 --> 00:07:32.461
They cram all the info right there
in the title, huh? That's helpful.

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:34.956
- And you are?
- Gillory works with us as a consultant.

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:38.458
She does, and she really feels as
though this painting has enough attention

00:07:38.592 --> 00:07:39.694
without flying someone in.

00:07:39.827 --> 00:07:41.429
Did the Fosters send you?

00:07:41.562 --> 00:07:44.799
No, the insurance company did. If I
can recover the Rembrandt safely,

00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:47.768
the insurance company can
avoid cutting a rather large check.

00:07:47.902 --> 00:07:50.571
Oh, good, good. What a relief.

00:07:50.705 --> 00:07:54.608
Okay, so this entire investigation is
about saving an insurance company money.

00:07:54.742 --> 00:07:58.346
That's awesome, right guys? Just wanted
to make sure you guys heard that. Go on.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.681
Morgan believes that the
Fosters' Rembrandt was targeted

00:08:00.815 --> 00:08:02.416
for a reason other than money.

00:08:04.118 --> 00:08:06.354
I mean, anything's possible,
but in my experience,

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.689
- it's always about money.
- Mmm.

00:08:08.823 --> 00:08:10.624
Well, not this time.

00:08:10.758 --> 00:08:13.928
I mean, thieves don't steal masterpieces
to hang on their walls, Ms. Gillory.

00:08:14.662 --> 00:08:16.797
Maybe this one did, Mr. Eastman.

00:08:18.566 --> 00:08:19.800
Morgan and I'll go see

00:08:19.934 --> 00:08:21.478
what the Fosters can tell us
about their painting.

00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:23.237
Great. Fill in Rhys on the way.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.808
Shall we?

00:08:39.854 --> 00:08:43.157
The moment we saw her at
auction, we knew we had to have her.

00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:46.961
I mean honestly,
we would have paid even more.

00:08:48.929 --> 00:08:50.331
We think she's priceless.

00:08:51.298 --> 00:08:53.968
Greg and I started a hedge fund
right out of college.

00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:56.804
We worked 80 hours a week
for decades.

00:08:56.937 --> 00:08:59.040
So by the time
we even thought about kids,

00:08:59.173 --> 00:09:03.044
we couldn't imagine chasing a
baby around here, making a mess.

00:09:03.177 --> 00:09:07.281
So, we often thought of the girl
in that painting as our daughter.

00:09:07.415 --> 00:09:09.626
Can you think of anyone who
may have wanted to steal from you?

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.318
No. You think this was personal?

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.556
- So, why share her?
- I'm sorry, what?

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:19.060
Mmm. Oh, just you're talking
about this painting like your daughter,

00:09:19.193 --> 00:09:21.062
and I've never put my daughter
in a museum.

00:09:21.195 --> 00:09:23.206
I'm just wondering why you
wouldn't keep it to yourself.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.068
Loaning out a masterpiece increases
its visibility and its reputation.

00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:29.870
And its value. Spend some time
in a museum, jacks up the price.

00:09:30.004 --> 00:09:31.314
You can sell it to the highest bidder.

00:09:31.338 --> 00:09:33.407
- She's not for sale.
- Mmm.

00:09:33.542 --> 00:09:35.352
Well, in my experience,
thieves are two things.

00:09:35.376 --> 00:09:37.278
They're greedy and chatty.

00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:39.180
And these masterpieces,

00:09:39.313 --> 00:09:42.059
they don't fetch the same price on the
black market as they do at an auction.

00:09:42.083 --> 00:09:44.051
So these thieves,
they like to talk to people.

00:09:44.185 --> 00:09:47.822
They ask around and all it will
take is one of these people to call me

00:09:47.955 --> 00:09:51.625
and I can help negotiate the
return of your lovely servant girl.

00:09:52.593 --> 00:09:54.328
Do you call her a servant girl?

00:09:55.096 --> 00:09:56.163
It's not a servant.

00:09:56.664 --> 00:09:57.698
Excuse me?

00:09:58.232 --> 00:10:00.768
She's leaning out the
windowsill looking for business.

00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:02.203
That's a working girl.

00:10:02.336 --> 00:10:04.872
Well, there's speculation that
the subject was a courtesan,

00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:07.245
but widely believed that
she was either a servant girl...

00:10:07.374 --> 00:10:09.610
A servant girl with a
gold braid? Come on.

00:10:09.743 --> 00:10:12.413
Look at the way she leans.
It's domestic, not provocative.

00:10:12.547 --> 00:10:16.417
It's upsetting, is what it is, because
she looks like a child, but she's working.

00:10:16.551 --> 00:10:18.018
She's contemplating life.

00:10:18.152 --> 00:10:20.921
- I-Is this important to the investigation?
- No, it's not.

00:10:21.055 --> 00:10:23.324
What else can you tell us
about the Rembrandt itself?

00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:27.428
The details about her
providence, they're all in here.

00:10:34.735 --> 00:10:37.606
This girl in the window's
traveled all over the world.

00:10:38.239 --> 00:10:42.676
Paris, London, Berlin. She's lived
a much more exciting life than me.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.222
Except now she's probably rolled
up in the back of somebody's van.

00:10:45.246 --> 00:10:49.116
Well, let's hope she got it all
out of her system first.

00:10:50.451 --> 00:10:52.319
- This is interesting.
- You got something?

00:10:52.453 --> 00:10:58.459
Maybe. Right after Rembrandt
painted the young girl in 1645, he sold it.

00:10:58.593 --> 00:11:01.153
At that point, it sort of bounced
around for a few hundred years,

00:11:01.262 --> 00:11:03.632
17th century Paris,
kind of skimmed this part,

00:11:03.764 --> 00:11:07.201
until it was purchased by a Prussian
nobleman who kept it until he died.

00:11:09.236 --> 00:11:11.138
Then his family kept it till 1932

00:11:11.272 --> 00:11:14.543
until Franz von Papen dissolved
the Free State of Prussia.

00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:16.253
I thought you said this was interesting.

00:11:16.277 --> 00:11:18.117
Look, I'm trying to care
about this case, okay?

00:11:18.212 --> 00:11:21.982
Which at the moment is just saving an
insurance company from having to pay money

00:11:22.116 --> 00:11:24.619
to a couple of people
who seem to be doing just fine.

00:11:24.752 --> 00:11:26.420
Where did she go next?

00:11:26.555 --> 00:11:30.991
To a Polish businessman in Kraków,
and he hung it in his family home.

00:11:31.125 --> 00:11:34.261
Then it just kind of bounced
around from collection to collection

00:11:34.395 --> 00:11:37.566
until good old Greg and Linda
paid a fortune for it.

00:11:37.698 --> 00:11:39.033
Why is any of this important?

00:11:39.668 --> 00:11:41.302
I don't know yet.

00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:43.813
Lab results came back on those
slags we found on the museum floor,

00:11:43.837 --> 00:11:47.007
tested positive for aluminum
oxide, so I did some research.

00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:49.376
<i>When aluminum
combines with ferric oxide,</i>

00:11:49.511 --> 00:11:52.079
<i>it creates a thermite reaction
hot enough to melt glass.</i>

00:11:52.213 --> 00:11:54.858
<i>Would explain why we didn't find
any glass shards under the sky light.</i>

00:11:54.882 --> 00:11:57.051
It also came up in a report
on another museum heist.

00:11:57.184 --> 00:12:00.454
Two years ago, a Matisse was stolen
from the Kunsthal Museum in Rotterdam.

00:12:00.589 --> 00:12:03.357
<i>And aluminum oxide was found
under the museum sky light.</i>

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.627
Which might mean this
isn't our thief's first rodeo.

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:07.261
You and Daphne look for others.

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:10.898
So far we found 19 heists around
the world with the same MO.

00:12:11.031 --> 00:12:14.636
Always a masterpiece stolen from a
gallery. Always worth 10 to 30 million.

00:12:14.768 --> 00:12:16.904
And traces of aluminum oxide
at every scene

00:12:17.037 --> 00:12:19.541
under a window
or a skylight just like ours.

00:12:19.674 --> 00:12:21.275
We have any idea who it might be?

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:24.345
Well, the internet seems to think
so. Some call him Jean-Baptiste.

00:12:24.478 --> 00:12:27.781
- He's French?
- No, but the first painting he stole was.

00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:30.084
"<i>The White Duck</i>
by Jean-Baptiste Oudrey."

00:12:30.217 --> 00:12:31.785
Stolen in Paris, 12 years ago.

00:12:32.353 --> 00:12:34.121
Tell me somebody's got eyes on him.

00:12:34.255 --> 00:12:35.389
Only once.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.560
He tried to steal a Picasso
in Madrid five years ago,

00:12:38.693 --> 00:12:41.395
but a guard shot him in the left
shoulder, and he fled empty-handed.

00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:43.073
Okay, so why can't
anybody find this guy?

00:12:43.097 --> 00:12:44.265
Because he might not exist.

00:12:44.965 --> 00:12:46.601
- He could be a myth.
- What do you mean?

00:12:46.735 --> 00:12:48.302
I mean, it's impressive work,

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:51.014
but the name Jean-Baptiste comes
up whenever there's a heist unsolved,

00:12:51.038 --> 00:12:54.341
the thief got in and out without a
trace, escaped with another masterpiece.

00:12:54.475 --> 00:12:55.776
Must be Jean-Baptiste.

00:12:55.909 --> 00:12:59.179
But is he real? Maybe.
It could be ten different guys.

00:12:59.313 --> 00:13:01.849
Check this out.
I searched public records.

00:13:01.982 --> 00:13:04.302
Someone sued claiming to be
the Rembrandt's rightful owner.

00:13:04.418 --> 00:13:06.053
We have a name?

00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:08.098
Yeah, an Ari Weisman, but it
looks like the records are sealed.

00:13:08.122 --> 00:13:10.525
Ari would be the first guy to
take matters into his own hands

00:13:10.659 --> 00:13:12.899
- when the court ruled against him.
- -We got an address?

00:13:13.027 --> 00:13:14.562
Yeah, looks like he's local.

00:13:15.095 --> 00:13:18.999
Captain, I could use a hand from
Detectives Ozdil and Forrester for a bit.

00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:20.602
Is this about that cold case?

00:13:22.637 --> 00:13:23.837
It is.

00:13:25.939 --> 00:13:26.974
You heard the lieutenant?

00:13:28.743 --> 00:13:30.077
Can I help with anything?

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.179
No, I'm good. I'll keep you posted.

00:13:34.181 --> 00:13:38.285
Why don't you guys go find out if this Ari
Weisman responds to the name Jean-Baptiste?

00:13:46.293 --> 00:13:48.162
We just wanted the painting back.

00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:49.330
How badly?

00:13:50.164 --> 00:13:52.132
Enough to sue, not steal.

00:13:53.735 --> 00:13:55.637
Sorry, you think
that painting belonged to you?

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.706
Not me, my grandma.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.276
My father bought that painting in 1932.

00:14:03.344 --> 00:14:07.448
I remember the day
he hang it up on the wall.

00:14:07.582 --> 00:14:13.020
<i>Whenever we all got together,
there was the girl smiling down to us.</i>

00:14:13.822 --> 00:14:16.357
Always felt she felt like part of the family.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.727
Your father had wonderful taste.

00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:20.094
It's a very special piece.

00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:22.496
One of my favorites.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.164
We lived in Kraków.

00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:31.004
My father, my mother, and my
two brothers, Jacob and Samuel.

00:14:31.773 --> 00:14:33.173
I was the youngest.

00:14:37.779 --> 00:14:40.414
The only one in our family that survived.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.719
When the Nazis came

00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:48.322
they took everything.

00:14:54.995 --> 00:14:56.130
I'm so sorry.

00:14:57.998 --> 00:14:59.133
We're still here.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.572
I'm guessing you searched
the auction catalogs for years.

00:15:04.706 --> 00:15:08.375
I thought she'd never find it, and
then one day there it was, up for sale.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:13.113
The owners. They wanted to sell it to us.

00:15:13.882 --> 00:15:15.449
For $20 million.

00:15:16.584 --> 00:15:19.687
We don't have $20 million.

00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:22.423
The court said we couldn't
prove it was stolen.

00:15:23.892 --> 00:15:24.925
Is that all?

00:15:29.564 --> 00:15:32.534
Actually, Ari, we have to ask,
where were you last night?

00:15:33.835 --> 00:15:36.270
I was here with my grandma.

00:15:37.237 --> 00:15:39.373
I saw your name
on the museum visitor logs.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.408
You were there a couple of days ago.

00:15:42.811 --> 00:15:45.078
I wanted to take a photo to show to her.

00:15:45.212 --> 00:15:47.390
Have you traveled outside
the country the last few years?

00:15:47.414 --> 00:15:48.550
No.

00:15:49.049 --> 00:15:51.418
No, but she keeps asking me
to take her to Poland.

00:15:51.553 --> 00:15:54.254
She wants to visit
the house where she grew up.

00:15:54.388 --> 00:15:55.890
She's not doing much traveling now.

00:15:56.423 --> 00:15:59.092
That painting was the closest
she'll come to going home.

00:16:00.093 --> 00:16:01.629
Please.

00:16:03.598 --> 00:16:04.833
Thank you.

00:16:14.909 --> 00:16:16.578
Thanks for the assist, you guys.

00:16:16.711 --> 00:16:20.113
Once every item is tagged,
photographed, and packaged for forensics

00:16:20.247 --> 00:16:23.016
I'll get TID to get started on
data extraction on his phone.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.219
Hopefully, we uncover
text messages, call logs.

00:16:25.352 --> 00:16:26.921
You want fiber analysis
on the backpack?

00:16:27.054 --> 00:16:28.523
All of it. I want the works.

00:16:28.656 --> 00:16:31.058
This much activity, people
gonna start asking questions.

00:16:31.191 --> 00:16:33.391
What are we saying if the
captain asks what we're doing?

00:16:33.494 --> 00:16:35.128
Tell him to talk to me.

00:16:35.262 --> 00:16:38.332
And let's run this stack of
photos through facial recognition.

00:16:38.465 --> 00:16:39.500
Okay.

00:16:45.205 --> 00:16:46.708
Okay, let's go over it one last time.

00:16:46.841 --> 00:16:49.343
- Mom, I got it. Trust me.
- I do trust you.

00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:52.379
That's why I'm paying you a
premium instead of hiring a babysitter.

00:16:52.514 --> 00:16:54.849
You've literally rejected
every babysitter in California.

00:16:54.983 --> 00:16:57.117
And I wouldn't say
you're paying me a premium.

00:16:57.251 --> 00:17:00.655
It is a perfectly reasonable wage
based on current market conditions.

00:17:00.788 --> 00:17:04.057
Listen, Chloe's routine has
changed since she's down a nap.

00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:05.359
So can you just indulge me?

00:17:05.492 --> 00:17:07.194
Nap time from one to three.

00:17:07.327 --> 00:17:08.963
Classical music on low.

00:17:09.096 --> 00:17:11.374
For lunch, she gets half a grilled
cheese and mushed up zucchini.

00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:13.944
After that, she can play with her
blocks, and if she gets frustrated,

00:17:13.968 --> 00:17:15.703
then distract her with the singing giraffe.

00:17:15.837 --> 00:17:17.677
- I wanna be very clear about something.
- Hmm.

00:17:17.705 --> 00:17:20.842
She's gonna get frustrated and
she will throw those blocks.

00:17:20.975 --> 00:17:22.810
- I'll be prepared.
- Okay, perfect.

00:17:23.343 --> 00:17:25.747
- Oh, wait, Mom. Hold on a sec.
- Can this wait? I got to go.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.050
I know, but I just wanted to know what the
cops are doing with Dad's stuff from his bag.

00:17:30.183 --> 00:17:32.020
Did they find anything yet?

00:17:33.487 --> 00:17:34.756
These things take time.

00:17:34.889 --> 00:17:36.991
I know, but can't you push them
to make it go faster?

00:17:37.124 --> 00:17:39.159
Can't you be patient, please?

00:17:39.293 --> 00:17:41.493
Listen, there's a reason
I gave his stuff to them, okay?

00:17:41.563 --> 00:17:44.140
They're gonna find something and
when they do, I'll let you know, I promise.

00:17:44.164 --> 00:17:45.867
- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.

00:17:46.901 --> 00:17:50.337
Also, I'm pretty sure that singing giraffe
is broken, so best of luck to you. Bye.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.439
- Is it really? No, Mom.
- Love you.

00:17:54.676 --> 00:17:56.109
And what is your job at the museum?

00:17:57.045 --> 00:17:58.680
I'm a gallery attendant.

00:17:58.813 --> 00:18:01.424
I've been the assistant curator at
The Harbach for almost twenty years.

00:18:01.448 --> 00:18:02.993
I just collect tickets and the paycheck.

00:18:03.017 --> 00:18:05.257
I don't know anything about
that painting getting stolen.

00:18:05.385 --> 00:18:07.698
Did you notice anything out of
the ordinary the past few weeks?

00:18:07.722 --> 00:18:09.222
Maybe a visitor lingering around.

00:18:09.356 --> 00:18:11.291
Mmm. One sneezed
on a Vermeer last week,

00:18:11.425 --> 00:18:16.396
so I showed him Caravaggio's <i>Judith
Beheading Holofernes</i> as a warning.

00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:19.232
How'd you get that bruise on your face?

00:18:19.734 --> 00:18:20.902
Took a nap on the floor.

00:18:22.604 --> 00:18:24.005
Hmm.

00:18:24.137 --> 00:18:25.849
Are you sure you haven't seen
anything out of the ordinary?

00:18:25.873 --> 00:18:28.676
I noticed a guy hanging around
the Rembrandt a few days ago.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:33.146
He looked familiar, like I'd see him a few
times, but I mean, we see a lot of faces.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.148
Do you remember anything
specific about him?

00:18:35.282 --> 00:18:38.218
- I remember thinking, he looked like he went for a run.
- Huh.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.458
Yeah, that's him.

00:18:49.731 --> 00:18:50.932
Oh, come on.

00:18:51.065 --> 00:18:52.800
We have to consider Ari a suspect.

00:18:52.934 --> 00:18:55.913
He has means, motive, and his alibi wants
the Rembrandt just as much as he does.

00:18:55.937 --> 00:18:58.057
Yeah, because the painting
belongs to her. Am I right?

00:18:58.573 --> 00:18:59.674
I don't disagree, but...

00:18:59.807 --> 00:19:01.208
No, but nothing.

00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:04.879
Listen, the Weismans are the
victims here, not the suspects.

00:19:05.013 --> 00:19:08.148
Are you picturing Miriam Weisman
rappelling through a skylight?

00:19:08.281 --> 00:19:10.985
Well, Ari's a gymnast. I can
totally picture him doing it.

00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:14.354
Look, all the museum employees
that we've talked to so far have alibis.

00:19:14.488 --> 00:19:15.890
Morgan, what are you doing?

00:19:16.024 --> 00:19:20.494
I am fixing our crime board
and correcting the timeline

00:19:20.628 --> 00:19:23.363
- to include the first time that the painting was stolen.
- In 1939?

00:19:23.497 --> 00:19:26.701
Well, why confine ourselves to
solving crimes in the 21st century?

00:19:26.834 --> 00:19:28.301
If we find <i>The Young Girl,</i>

00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:31.405
we should be returning it to
Miriam Weisman, not the Fosters.

00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:33.541
I got to take this.

00:19:34.942 --> 00:19:36.511
Morgan, it's not that simple.

00:19:36.644 --> 00:19:38.756
I don't know what to tell you.
There's gotta be something we can do.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.492
Well, even if we had the jurisdiction
to resolve a crime from 80 years ago,

00:19:41.516 --> 00:19:43.383
it's just not how the system works.

00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:45.551
I really wish there was
more we could do.

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:06.708
Who was that?

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:08.207
Excuse me?

00:20:08.308 --> 00:20:09.376
Who was that?

00:20:10.578 --> 00:20:12.379
You said that thieves love
to talk to people

00:20:12.513 --> 00:20:14.048
and sometimes those people call you.

00:20:14.182 --> 00:20:15.415
Was that people calling?

00:20:17.018 --> 00:20:18.720
A man called.

00:20:18.853 --> 00:20:21.856
Claims he knows where the painting
is. He wants to meet with me to discuss.

00:20:23.524 --> 00:20:24.559
Where?

00:20:25.459 --> 00:20:27.327
You don't wanna tell me

00:20:27.461 --> 00:20:30.007
'cause you're worried if the police
get involved, they're gonna ruin it?

00:20:30.031 --> 00:20:33.901
If we spook whoever this guy is,
we may never recover the painting.

00:20:36.904 --> 00:20:39.707
- Fine, then I'm coming with you.
- I can't show up with the cops.

00:20:39.841 --> 00:20:41.274
I don't see any cops, do you?

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:50.618
Where is this guy?

00:20:51.719 --> 00:20:52.720
He's late.

00:20:52.854 --> 00:20:54.488
And why exactly is he calling you?

00:20:55.489 --> 00:20:58.529
Well, not to sound insufferable, but
I'm the only person that does what I do.

00:20:59.927 --> 00:21:01.863
Sorry, you were trying
to not sound insufferable?

00:21:01.996 --> 00:21:05.465
Well, from what I gather, you're the
only person that does what you do too.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.267
It's a little different, but sure.

00:21:08.401 --> 00:21:11.371
Well, I think
we have some time to spare.

00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:13.941
Let's see how this guy got in.

00:21:14.075 --> 00:21:16.811
- Knock yourself out.
- Come on, you're coming with me.

00:21:18.311 --> 00:21:20.480
I need your insufferable
talents on that roof.

00:21:28.288 --> 00:21:30.423
If I could just Hello.

00:21:34.729 --> 00:21:36.130
Lieutenant, you got a second?

00:21:36.264 --> 00:21:37.297
Good news only.

00:21:37.832 --> 00:21:39.133
Well, TID is backed up.

00:21:39.267 --> 00:21:41.569
Hobson says cracking that
BlackBerry could take weeks,

00:21:41.702 --> 00:21:43.062
too many phones, not enough texts.

00:21:43.137 --> 00:21:45.337
Remind her of the parking
ticket I got her mother out of

00:21:45.405 --> 00:21:46.845
in front of the Van Nuys courthouse.

00:21:46.974 --> 00:21:48.009
She owes me.

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:50.419
You know the difference
between good news and bad?

00:21:50.443 --> 00:21:52.756
I ran those photos in the
backpack through facial recognition.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.782
No criminal record
on the ones we could match

00:21:54.916 --> 00:21:56.716
parking tickets, traffic stops,
nothing major.

00:21:56.818 --> 00:21:58.820
- And the ones we couldn't match?
- Only one.

00:22:04.158 --> 00:22:05.960
All right, I'll take it from here.

00:22:18.272 --> 00:22:20.875
Did you know there's a German
diaper derby competition?

00:22:21.943 --> 00:22:23.177
It's held annually in Bavaria.

00:22:23.311 --> 00:22:25.847
Contestants are judged
on speed, efficiency,

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.649
and the artistic flourish
of the diaper application.

00:22:29.482 --> 00:22:31.786
- I'd do well.
- Is Chloe napping or not?

00:22:31.919 --> 00:22:34.789
Yes, which brings me to my next point.

00:22:34.922 --> 00:22:38.526
Since I'm helping you babysit
and not being babysat

00:22:38.659 --> 00:22:40.360
I'll give you 10% of my pay.

00:22:46.499 --> 00:22:48.069
Fine, 20%.

00:22:48.202 --> 00:22:49.203
Deal.

00:22:49.837 --> 00:22:52.073
And I won't tell Mom you're
going through her clothes.

00:22:52.206 --> 00:22:53.440
How generous of you.

00:23:11.759 --> 00:23:13.728
What if we promise
not to touch anything?

00:23:14.528 --> 00:23:16.097
That works for me.

00:23:20.467 --> 00:23:21.869
Have you ever stolen anything?

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:24.437
Nothing with a provenance, you?

00:23:24.906 --> 00:23:27.642
Yes, stole a classmate's
trainers once in primary school.

00:23:28.242 --> 00:23:31.045
Scotland Yard know about this?

00:23:31.178 --> 00:23:32.479
He deserved it.

00:23:32.947 --> 00:23:36.183
Used to kick this kid, Gideon, in
the shins with those shoes at recess.

00:23:36.651 --> 00:23:38.418
Well, did you wear them to school?

00:23:38.552 --> 00:23:41.756
No, I donated them to a thrift
store right by the bus stop.

00:23:41.889 --> 00:23:44.792
That way he could see them every
time he looked through the window.

00:23:44.926 --> 00:23:46.060
You monster.

00:23:47.929 --> 00:23:50.598
- This glass is reflective.
- What do you mean?

00:23:50.731 --> 00:23:53.034
These skylights all have
a one-way window film on them.

00:23:53.167 --> 00:23:54.769
The thief wouldn't be able to see in.

00:23:54.902 --> 00:23:58.572
It's a risky little game, breaking
glass, not knowing who's down there.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.408
Excuse me.

00:24:02.176 --> 00:24:03.210
We were just leaving.

00:24:03.744 --> 00:24:06.280
The guard saw you come up here.
Are you Mr. Eastman?

00:24:07.248 --> 00:24:10.084
- Yeah, why?
- One of my docents found this at the front.

00:24:11.052 --> 00:24:12.353
They didn't see who left it.

00:24:29.103 --> 00:24:31.863
So you go back to the crime scene
on your own without a police escort?

00:24:31.973 --> 00:24:33.541
Well, yeah...

00:24:33.674 --> 00:24:35.686
- Detective Karadec, did you know about this?
- Know about what, sir?

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:39.013
The museum director just called me and
told me that your partner took Mr. Eastman

00:24:39.146 --> 00:24:41.015
on a tour of the crime scene.

00:24:41.148 --> 00:24:44.118
- That's.
- Ducked right under the tape, cut the seal.

00:24:44.752 --> 00:24:47.088
Are you trying to sabotage
this investigation?

00:24:47.221 --> 00:24:49.457
You made it quite clear
how you feel about this case.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.492
No, I'm not trying to sabotage
anything, okay? I was trying to help.

00:24:52.626 --> 00:24:55.529
He was going anyway. Would you
prefer I just let him go by himself?

00:24:55.663 --> 00:24:57.641
Neither of you should've
been there in the first place.

00:24:57.665 --> 00:24:59.633
Okay, I understand that. And I'm sorry.

00:24:59.767 --> 00:25:01.607
But if we didn't,
we wouldn't have gotten this.

00:25:01.702 --> 00:25:03.504
Whoever left this wants
to meet at 1:00 p.m.

00:25:06.474 --> 00:25:08.442
That gives us less than 2 hours.

00:25:08.576 --> 00:25:10.287
Are Forrester and Ozdil still
with the lieutenant?

00:25:10.311 --> 00:25:11.645
You thinking a surveillance op?

00:25:11.779 --> 00:25:14.181
Yes, and we need to see
the museum's security cameras.

00:25:14.315 --> 00:25:16.159
Maybe we can get eyes
on whoever dropped this off.

00:25:16.183 --> 00:25:18.295
Don't you think that Rhys should
take the lead on this though?

00:25:18.319 --> 00:25:21.088
- And why would we do that?
- Because I'm who they want to speak to.

00:25:21.222 --> 00:25:23.900
Great idea. I'll send Morgan with you
and you can tamper with more evidence.

00:25:23.924 --> 00:25:25.626
Hey, I'm sorry, okay?

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.362
I'm sorry I went to a building
without your permission first.

00:25:28.496 --> 00:25:30.898
- I see now that that was a bad idea.
- Bad idea?

00:25:32.133 --> 00:25:35.069
How about reckless and insubordinate?

00:25:36.003 --> 00:25:37.571
I just said I'm sorry.

00:25:37.705 --> 00:25:40.474
I know that you don't like rules,
but when you're in my precinct,

00:25:40.608 --> 00:25:42.943
I expect you to follow my command.

00:25:44.879 --> 00:25:46.280
You practice that in a mirror?

00:25:47.581 --> 00:25:51.052
- Morgan, calm...
- Do not tell me to calm down.

00:25:53.054 --> 00:25:54.855
We need to grab someone from the SIS.

00:25:54.989 --> 00:25:57.024
The sooner that we get
to the ransom's location,

00:25:57.158 --> 00:25:58.802
the sooner that we can start surveillance.

00:25:58.826 --> 00:26:00.626
- Okay, great. Rhys and I will follow you.
- No.

00:26:01.062 --> 00:26:03.764
Detective Karadec and I
can handle it from here.

00:26:03.898 --> 00:26:05.633
Our consultants have done enough.

00:26:05.766 --> 00:26:09.070
Are you kicking me off the case?

00:26:09.203 --> 00:26:10.771
I walked up on a roof!

00:26:10.905 --> 00:26:13.908
Oh, great. The Fosters are on
their way up. They want an update.

00:26:14.041 --> 00:26:16.441
Talk to them. I'll be waiting
downstairs. Just make it quick.

00:26:16.545 --> 00:26:18.279
What is going on?

00:26:19.246 --> 00:26:20.881
Morgan, what were you thinking?

00:26:21.015 --> 00:26:22.049
I get it!

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.888
This is why I work alone.

00:26:32.259 --> 00:26:33.427
Do you drink alone?

00:26:34.628 --> 00:26:36.797
- I prefer to have company.
- Great.

00:26:38.065 --> 00:26:39.366
Good luck.

00:26:46.907 --> 00:26:48.543
You believe that guy?

00:26:48.676 --> 00:26:51.479
Kicking me off the case so he
can go follow a lead that we found.

00:26:51.612 --> 00:26:54.648
He knows how I work. I do my
thing and then cases get solved, right?

00:26:54.782 --> 00:26:56.383
What's wrong with that?

00:26:56.518 --> 00:26:58.529
Nothing's wrong with that, Rhys.
That's the answer to that question.

00:26:58.553 --> 00:27:00.121
You have every right to be upset.

00:27:00.254 --> 00:27:02.756
Yeah, I know I do because
he called me out like I'm a child.

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:04.810
I have kids, I don't even
talk to them like that.

00:27:07.628 --> 00:27:08.662
What?

00:27:09.531 --> 00:27:11.098
Boys, girls, mix?

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.544
Mix. Don't change the subject.
I gotta get this out.

00:27:13.568 --> 00:27:14.802
And why are we still driving?

00:27:14.935 --> 00:27:17.271
Shouldn't we be
eating and-and drinking by now?

00:27:17.404 --> 00:27:19.541
Are you suggesting I go faster?

00:27:19.673 --> 00:27:22.385
Look at the kind of car you're driving.
We just got passed by a Subaru.

00:27:22.409 --> 00:27:23.944
You should be ashamed of yourself.

00:27:28.949 --> 00:27:29.950
Where did you get this?

00:27:30.084 --> 00:27:31.485
Our consultants came across it.

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.663
Good news is your painting
doesn't appear to be damaged.

00:27:33.687 --> 00:27:35.322
What happens now?

00:27:35.456 --> 00:27:36.857
We're supposed to pay the ransom?

00:27:36.991 --> 00:27:38.527
That's not what I said, sir.

00:27:38.659 --> 00:27:40.971
The LAPD never pays ransom.
We don't suggest that you do either.

00:27:40.995 --> 00:27:43.406
I don't believe this. Okay. So
what do you suggest that we do?

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:45.199
Are we just gonna sit here
and do nothing?

00:27:45.332 --> 00:27:47.368
Detective, we have been waiting
by the phone,

00:27:47.501 --> 00:27:49.837
and we have heard nothing,
and now-now this?

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:53.140
Who sent you this? Do you have
any leads? Anything?

00:27:53.274 --> 00:27:56.043
We're assembling a team to follow
that lead and recover your painting.

00:27:56.177 --> 00:27:59.648
And how long does it take
to assemble this team of yours?

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.458
They're assembling
in the war room right now,

00:28:01.482 --> 00:28:04.218
and I should be with them
instead of here.

00:28:04.351 --> 00:28:07.421
Detective, we just want her back.

00:28:07.556 --> 00:28:09.390
I understand, sir.
Let us handle the response.

00:28:09.524 --> 00:28:11.492
We'll get back to you
when we find out more.

00:28:12.627 --> 00:28:14.728
Thank you for keeping us
informed, Detective.

00:28:15.963 --> 00:28:16.997
Of course.

00:28:20.067 --> 00:28:21.570
- Just a little bit more.
- Yes, sir.

00:28:21.702 --> 00:28:22.870
Thanks, bro.

00:28:25.306 --> 00:28:29.076
<i>- This is Arthur.</i>
- Hi, this is Ava Sinquerra.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.344
Boss, you want us to...

00:28:30.477 --> 00:28:32.079
<i>Hello?</i>

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.381
Um.

00:28:35.349 --> 00:28:38.687
I just wanted to call you because
there's something I didn't get an answer to

00:28:38.819 --> 00:28:41.055
at the diner 'cause my mom flipped out.

00:28:41.188 --> 00:28:43.257
Well, how does your mom feel
about you calling me?

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:45.527
<i>Oh, this call never happened.</i>

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.597
Actually, I should probably tell
her so she won't ground me again.

00:28:49.063 --> 00:28:50.864
<i>Yeah, well, it sounds like a wise move.</i>

00:28:50.998 --> 00:28:53.702
Look, Ava, I'm in the middle
of working right now, so...

00:28:53.834 --> 00:28:56.136
You said that I reminded you of my dad?

00:29:00.007 --> 00:29:01.175
What was he like?

00:29:05.714 --> 00:29:06.747
Hello?

00:29:09.016 --> 00:29:11.785
Look, I won't bother you again.
I promise. I just.

00:29:14.355 --> 00:29:17.235
I'm sorry. Maybe this wasn't such
a good idea. I'll just leave you alone.

00:29:17.358 --> 00:29:20.094
No, no, just hold on a second.

00:29:21.195 --> 00:29:25.132
If you wanna have a serious talk about your
dad, then we have to do it the right way.

00:29:26.433 --> 00:29:28.902
I don't know, maybe me, you,
and your mom, we could.

00:29:29.837 --> 00:29:33.107
<i>I don't know. Find ourselves
back at that diner at some point.</i>

00:29:33.774 --> 00:29:35.075
<i>How does that sound to you?</i>

00:29:35.209 --> 00:29:36.777
Sure, yeah.

00:29:37.411 --> 00:29:40.247
Listen, Ava, until that
happens, you and I, we can't.

00:29:45.553 --> 00:29:48.989
Look, Roman didn't always
do things the easy way,

00:29:49.557 --> 00:29:52.293
<i>but he always did things the right way.</i>

00:29:52.426 --> 00:29:54.928
I mean, he had a lot to do with
me getting my life together

00:29:55.062 --> 00:29:58.432
and believe me,
he saved my ass more than once.

00:30:02.136 --> 00:30:04.972
He's a stand-up guy
through and through.

00:30:07.841 --> 00:30:10.010
Well, look, Ava,
I gotta get back to work here.

00:30:10.144 --> 00:30:11.845
- Hey, Arthur.
- Yeah.

00:30:14.081 --> 00:30:15.149
Thank you.

00:30:16.216 --> 00:30:17.686
Of course, sweetheart.

00:30:34.602 --> 00:30:37.838
Everything all right, Detective?
Something on your mind?

00:30:40.841 --> 00:30:42.610
You know, I read somewhere

00:30:42.744 --> 00:30:45.747
carrying around unexpressed frustrations
is like carrying a heavy backpack.

00:30:45.879 --> 00:30:49.784
Every unspoken thought adds
another stone to the load,

00:30:49.917 --> 00:30:51.952
making your journey much more difficult.

00:30:53.655 --> 00:30:55.322
- She's confused, sir.
- Hmm.

00:30:55.456 --> 00:30:56.490
Yeah, so am I.

00:30:57.124 --> 00:30:58.225
You're confused?

00:31:00.729 --> 00:31:02.496
Sir, is there something
you wanna tell me?

00:31:04.799 --> 00:31:08.469
I can't protect you
if I don't know where you are.

00:31:09.637 --> 00:31:13.073
I have to be in a position
to help if things go south.

00:31:13.207 --> 00:31:15.109
I need to know everything,

00:31:16.243 --> 00:31:18.212
and that's not because I don't trust her,

00:31:19.179 --> 00:31:20.715
but because I do.

00:31:24.218 --> 00:31:25.520
Still confused?

00:31:26.086 --> 00:31:27.756
No.

00:31:27.921 --> 00:31:33.093
Good. Because the same applies to
you and everyone else. You understand?

00:31:34.395 --> 00:31:35.530
Yes, sir.

00:31:37.665 --> 00:31:40.901
Next time you lose your cool with her,
I'd suggest you find a different approach.

00:31:41.034 --> 00:31:42.637
Oh, yeah. Why is that?

00:31:42.771 --> 00:31:45.048
Because if you don't, it's gonna
put me and you in a position

00:31:45.072 --> 00:31:47.241
where things will definitely go south.

00:32:04.458 --> 00:32:05.527
All clear.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.002
Just getting a little impatient.

00:32:15.135 --> 00:32:16.946
Don't worry. The ransomer
will turn up soon enough.

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:18.305
With you, Detective.

00:32:19.541 --> 00:32:21.308
Impatient with me. Why?

00:32:21.442 --> 00:32:24.612
We're sitting here nice and quiet.
Nothing but time for you to read me in.

00:32:24.746 --> 00:32:26.079
Read you in on what?

00:32:28.817 --> 00:32:30.184
Roman Sinquerra.

00:32:34.188 --> 00:32:35.189
Come on, Adam.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:37.826
You don't think I see things?

00:32:41.028 --> 00:32:42.095
What do you wanna know?

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.704
Oh. We don't have time
for this. It'll blow our cover.

00:32:51.606 --> 00:32:52.973
Or spook our ransomer.

00:32:53.106 --> 00:32:55.342
We're here for the
painting, not some car thief.

00:32:56.376 --> 00:32:57.411
Leave it alone.

00:32:57.879 --> 00:32:59.379
He's committing a crime. I

00:33:00.815 --> 00:33:01.950
I'll handle this.

00:33:02.082 --> 00:33:03.383
Detective.

00:33:03.518 --> 00:33:05.620
Hey! Hey, man, that's my car.

00:33:06.153 --> 00:33:09.256
What are you doing?
Bro, get out of my car now.

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:12.259
Whoa! LAPD, put the gun down.

00:33:12.827 --> 00:33:17.632
Now. At your feet. Let's go.
Put that gun down now.

00:33:20.635 --> 00:33:22.670
Drop it. On the ground.

00:33:25.773 --> 00:33:27.976
Good. Keep your hands
where I can see 'em, son.

00:33:29.844 --> 00:33:31.746
Hey, that's our guy. Let's go!

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:44.491
Hey! Hey!

00:33:45.827 --> 00:33:46.928
Move!

00:33:48.997 --> 00:33:50.497
Wait, so now you're stealing the car.

00:33:50.632 --> 00:33:52.600
That's right. It's your lucky day.

00:34:09.049 --> 00:34:11.485
- Detective.
<i>- You took my car, sir.</i>

00:34:11.619 --> 00:34:13.487
Yeah, I couldn't wait.
He was getting away.

00:34:20.895 --> 00:34:22.362
Well, I'm right behind you.

00:34:23.698 --> 00:34:25.600
What? You stole that car?

00:34:25.733 --> 00:34:29.637
<i>No, sir. I commandeered a private vehicle
in an emergency because you left me.</i>

00:34:29.771 --> 00:34:32.941
I had no choice. I told you
not to mess with that guy.

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:36.376
He was committing a crime!

00:34:43.918 --> 00:34:46.921
Get out of that car, Detective.
You hear me?

00:34:52.192 --> 00:34:53.795
Yes, I hear you, sir.

00:34:58.298 --> 00:34:59.801
Pull over right now!

00:35:00.902 --> 00:35:02.837
Pull to the side of the road.

00:35:08.776 --> 00:35:09.944
Need some help?

00:35:10.078 --> 00:35:11.445
I got it handled.

00:35:18.853 --> 00:35:21.188
- That was close.
- I'm well aware!

00:35:24.092 --> 00:35:25.760
I'm gonna make my move!

00:35:25.893 --> 00:35:27.662
What move? No move!

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.355
Let's pull a two-vehicle box-in.

00:35:55.489 --> 00:35:57.558
Just pull over and get
a chopper in the air.

00:35:57.692 --> 00:35:59.060
We need eyes in the sky.

00:36:01.129 --> 00:36:02.730
Just listen to me, Detective!

00:36:16.343 --> 00:36:18.880
Had we both been in one car,
I think that we.

00:36:23.051 --> 00:36:24.351
Never mind.

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:30.892
<i>I'm not even convinced
he should have the job.</i>

00:36:31.025 --> 00:36:33.427
I mean, Lieutenant Soto was
absolutely qualified.

00:36:33.561 --> 00:36:35.195
Well, how did he get the promotion?

00:36:35.328 --> 00:36:37.330
Politics, nepotism, I guess.

00:36:37.464 --> 00:36:40.001
You know what it might be? He's tall.

00:36:40.134 --> 00:36:42.654
Data shows taller people get
promoted faster. Did you know that?

00:36:42.704 --> 00:36:45.384
But if you can't buy pants off
the rack, what's the point of living?

00:36:45.439 --> 00:36:49.209
Okay. When's the last time
you bought pants off a rack?

00:36:49.342 --> 00:36:52.513
Pretty sure there's a tailor in London
who's got your inseam memorized.

00:36:52.647 --> 00:36:54.916
Well, you know, I do like clothes that fit.

00:36:55.049 --> 00:36:56.249
Mm-hmm, I can tell.

00:36:58.186 --> 00:37:02.190
You think you know me? But you
can't get past the accent, can you?

00:37:03.157 --> 00:37:06.561
I mean, you do sound like you
were born clutching a croquet mallet.

00:37:07.862 --> 00:37:09.864
Well, let me share something with you.

00:37:09.997 --> 00:37:12.499
My father, he was a bin man.

00:37:13.534 --> 00:37:15.837
Always out collecting
other people's rubbish.

00:37:16.571 --> 00:37:18.873
All the kids at school,
they used to make fun of me.

00:37:19.006 --> 00:37:23.878
They said that they could smell it on
me, but when I walked into a museum,

00:37:25.046 --> 00:37:29.083
I was staring up at the same beauty as kings
and queens, like, this kid from Stevenage.

00:37:29.884 --> 00:37:31.586
It didn't matter who I was.

00:37:32.352 --> 00:37:36.256
I mean, the <i>Mona Lisa</i> smiled at
me like she smiled at everyone.

00:37:38.025 --> 00:37:39.292
Mmm.

00:37:40.027 --> 00:37:43.296
I'm gonna be honest, I'm still really
pissed, so I wasn't fully listening,

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.701
but I did hear bin man and <i>Mona Lisa</i>.

00:37:46.834 --> 00:37:49.704
Not exactly sure how they're
connected, but I bet it was poignant.

00:37:49.837 --> 00:37:51.304
- It was.
- Mm-hmm.

00:37:51.438 --> 00:37:53.406
- I mean, I'm glad you didn't hear it.
- Mmm?

00:37:54.108 --> 00:37:58.012
You don't strike me as a girl that's attracted
to someone that's so sentimental anyway.

00:37:59.714 --> 00:38:01.983
Hmm. What am I attracted to?

00:38:04.284 --> 00:38:05.987
I think you appreciate a challenge.

00:38:11.125 --> 00:38:14.829
I think you need something exciting enough
to get you out of that head of yours.

00:38:14.962 --> 00:38:16.063
Really?

00:38:17.064 --> 00:38:18.099
Like what?

00:38:20.701 --> 00:38:21.769
I have a few ideas.

00:38:58.206 --> 00:39:00.286
<i>He tried to steal a Picasso
in Madrid five years ago.</i>

00:39:00.373 --> 00:39:03.644
<i>The guard shot him in the left
shoulder, and he fled empty-handed.</i>

00:39:03.778 --> 00:39:05.378
<i>I'm the only person that does what I do.</i>

00:39:05.478 --> 00:39:07.849
<i>Nineteen heists around
the world with the same MO.</i>

00:39:07.982 --> 00:39:09.584
<i>This isn't our thief's first rodeo.</i>

00:39:09.717 --> 00:39:11.586
<i>In my experience,
it's always about money.</i>

00:39:11.719 --> 00:39:13.120
Have you ever stolen anything?

00:39:13.254 --> 00:39:14.989
<i>Jean-Baptiste might not exist.</i>

00:39:15.122 --> 00:39:18.659
It could be a myth. It's a very
special piece, one of my favorites.

00:39:21.329 --> 00:39:22.362
I should get that.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.400
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

00:39:27.535 --> 00:39:30.004
I'm down at the museum, and
you're gonna wanna see this.

00:39:31.839 --> 00:39:33.608
Our case just got blown wide open.

00:40:10.511 --> 00:40:11.746
Who are you?

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:24.125
Where is it?

00:40:25.192 --> 00:40:26.761
I want that backpack.
