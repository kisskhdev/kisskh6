1
00:00:00.014 --> 00:00:08.014

2
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:25,712
Even though he’s hurting,

3
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:29,924
Arkin always thinks
about how you’re doing.

4
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:32,232
Cheers.

5
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:34,514
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

6
00:02:35,138 --> 00:02:37,766
Wait! Don’t leave yet.

7
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:39,893
Good thing you’re available.

8
00:02:44,856 --> 00:02:45,857
Via—

9
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:48,902
What should I do
if I see you again?

10
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,445
Hug me.

11
00:02:50,695 --> 00:02:52,822
Then let go of me again.

12
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,368
Hey! Why are you so quiet, Luna?

13
00:02:57,368 --> 00:03:00,079
I’m just feeling a little sad.
Sam’s leaving for New York,

14
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,374
and then Via’s
leaving soon, too.

15
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,585
You’re making me cry, too.

16
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,587
Go see Arkin to say goodbye.

17
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,172
It’s okay, Arkin.

18
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:13,136
I want all my firsts to be with you.

19
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:20,266
Via is leaving now.
She’s going to Spain,

20
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,807
and she’s going to work there.

21
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:26,147
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

22
00:03:26,147 --> 00:03:27,165
Cheers.

23
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,484
Wow. We’re so,
so proud of you guys.

24
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:30,902
Too bad the three
of them aren’t here.

25
00:03:30,902 --> 00:03:31,820
It’s annoying.

26
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,196
Come on, let’s take a photo first!

27
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,364
So I can send it to them.

28
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:35,698
Sure, let’s take a picture.

29
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:43,932
So, Via, what were you
going to say again?

30
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:48,837
First, congratulations to all of us.

31
00:03:49,587 --> 00:03:51,464
We’re finally all architects now.

32
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:54,843
I just want to thank you
guys, because

33
00:03:55,885 --> 00:03:57,136
you never left me.

34
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,596
Thank you...

35
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:01,975
for sticking with me,
no matter what.

36
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,688
I really want to keep working
with you guys as workmates…

37
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,899
but—

38
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,028
I’m leaving next week.

39
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:16,656
Where to?

40
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:18,032
For vacation?

41
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:19,033
For how many weeks?

42
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,869
The way you announced it,

43
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:22,620
it’s like you’re going
to be gone forever.

44
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,956
Where to? Boracay?
Siargao? Bangkok?

45
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:27,333
- We’ll go with you.
- Yeah. We’re coming with you!

46
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:29,752
To Spain.

47
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,547
I have an opportunity
to work there.

48
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:34,507
Maybe for a few years?

49
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,736
Or maybe for good.

50
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,179
- For good?
- For good?

51
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:41,389
Hold on—

52
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:42,765
To Spain?

53
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:43,867
Huh?

54
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:45,184
You’re moving to Spain?

55
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:47,103
Yeah.

56
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:48,771
I already booked a flight.

57
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:50,103
It’s next week.

58
00:04:51,065 --> 00:04:52,275
I already have a flight…

59
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:55,862
Sevi,

60
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,031
please don’t tell Arkin.

61
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:01,951
He doesn’t need
to know about this.

62
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:09,500
What kind of job
do you have there?

63
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:11,961
Do you have an agency?
This better not be a scam.

64
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,132
I’ll be working with my aunt.

65
00:05:16,424 --> 00:05:18,134
My aunt helped me
get the job there,

66
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:19,802
so don’t worry.

67
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:23,306
Wait, what about
Sam and Yanna?

68
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:24,515
Do they know about this?

69
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:26,559
I already told Yanna before.

70
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:29,145
I talked to Sam earlier.

71
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:34,150
Does it have to be next week?

72
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,237
Yeah.

73
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,990
I didn’t want to tell you yet.

74
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,452
I wanted to tell you
only when it was final.

75
00:05:45,787 --> 00:05:47,956
Now, it’s really final.

76
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:51,250
Damn, you’re actually going
to study in Spain,

77
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,669
not just España Boulevard.

78
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:54,796
But, no kidding?

79
00:05:55,296 --> 00:05:56,381
You’re leaving next week?

80
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:57,632
- You’re leaving already?
- Sevi, come on!

81
00:05:57,632 --> 00:06:01,386
Stop repeating it.
Yes, it’s next week.

82
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,555
This makes me sad.

83
00:06:05,223 --> 00:06:08,518
Sam’s already going,
and now you’re leaving too.

84
00:06:08,518 --> 00:06:11,688
Hold on, I’ll just
message the group.

85
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:13,022
We need to see each other

86
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:15,024
before we all go our
separate ways, okay?

87
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:17,944
Yeah. Let’s take a picture
so we can send it.

88
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,195
- Come on…
- Okay.

89
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:21,322
Look here.

90
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,616
One—

91
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,159
What? You’re not including me?

92
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:26,119
Never mind.

93
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,453
One, two, three—

94
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:30,415
Come on, Sevi. One, two—

95
00:06:30,415 --> 00:06:31,833
One, two—

96
00:06:36,337 --> 00:06:37,714
Awesome. I’ll send this, okay?

97
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:40,008
Oh, come on…

98
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:47,098
Guys, Sam and Via
are leaving soon.

99
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:49,225
Let’s do a farewell party, okay?

100
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,019
All right. Cheers, hurry up.

101
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:14,876
You’re making me cry, too.

102
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:17,086
Let me hold you, bestie.

103
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:18,963
You’re making us all cry.

104
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:29,182
We’re going to miss you, Sam.

105
00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:33,936
Don’t go.

106
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:35,563
I have to.

107
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:37,440
Visit me sometime, okay?

108
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:41,250
Via.

109
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:42,445
Yeah?

110
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:43,321
I’ll take you home.

111
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:44,258
Huh?

112
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:45,826
Sure, thanks.

113
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:46,935
Oh, it’s nothing.

114
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,228
I won’t be able to do
this often anymore.

115
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:54,207
Via.

116
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:57,293
Are you really not going to tell Arkin?

117
00:07:58,294 --> 00:08:01,089
Doesn’t he at least
deserve to know?

118
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,053
I already ended whatever we had.

119
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:10,100
There’s no connection
between us anymore.

120
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,940
Don’t you regret that
it just ended like that,

121
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,775
the connection between
the two of you?

122
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:24,362
After spending almost
your whole lives together.

123
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:30,034
I mean, I’m just worried
as a friend to both of you.

124
00:08:31,953 --> 00:08:34,705
With me, it was only five years,

125
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,916
and it was already so hard.

126
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:39,460
What more with you two?

127
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:45,258
He’ll be fine.

128
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:47,760
He can handle not having me.

129
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:52,265
And I’ll manage too,
so don’t worry, okay?

130
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:55,434
Besides, you can
tell him anyway.

131
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,270
After I’ve left.

132
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,234
Don’t you want to see him
one last time before you go?

133
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:05,736
Even just as friends.

134
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,702
Okay.

135
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:14,579
I’ll just get the car.

136
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:36,517
Have a safe flight.

137
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,740
I’m sorry, sir. I can’t let you in.

138
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,490
- Sir.
- Via!

139
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,326
Sir, please just listen
You’re really not allowed.

140
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,744
- Sir.
- Via!

141
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:55,703
You’re really not allowed, sir.

142
00:09:55,703 --> 00:09:56,704
I’m sorry.

143
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:58,812
This is as far as you can go, sir.

144
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,459
Please stay there, sir.

145
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:02,460
You really can’t go
past this point.

146
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,128
Sir, please don’t force it.

147
00:10:04,128 --> 00:10:05,087
Please don’t force it.

148
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:06,756
I just need to stop
someone from leaving.

149
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:08,049
I’m sorry, sir.
You’re really not allowed.

150
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:35,344
I wonder what he
looks like in person.

151
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:38,222
- I’ve waited for this my whole life.
- Yes! Me too.

152
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,558
Good thing he came
here to Spain, right?

153
00:11:40,558 --> 00:11:43,686
- If not, we’d be the ones going there.
- Perfect timing that we’re here.

154
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:44,937
Oh my gosh!

155
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,940
Larkin Sanchez is so handsome.

156
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:55,823
Oh my gosh, I’m so happy
we got great seats.

157
00:11:55,823 --> 00:11:57,992
- Exactly.
- We’re right in front!

158
00:11:57,992 --> 00:11:59,493
Come on, Via, let’s go.

159
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:01,412
We’re so excited for you
to meet Larkin!

160
00:12:02,246 --> 00:12:03,080
Let’s go.

161
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,540
You guys go ahead, I’ll follow.

162
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,208
- You sure?
- Okay then.

163
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,085
- I can’t wait anymore.
- Make sure you follow, okay?

164
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:09,670

It was nice

211
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,443
seeing you again.

212
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,364
Kino…

213
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,812
What an amazing welcome.

214
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:11,865
I wonder if his fans
still remember me?

215
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,543
Will they still recognize me?

216
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,154
Are they still mad at me?

217
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:20,777
You didn’t even
remove the traced letters.

218
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:21,625
You’ve got some nerve.

219
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,293
- You didn’t even help, girl.
- What?

220
00:18:23,627 --> 00:18:25,671
- Don’t start a fight with me.
- I came up with the concept. I did!

221
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,047
You came up with it, but—

222
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:29,717
Via!

223
00:18:30,134 --> 00:18:31,260
Via!

224
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:34,972
What—

225
00:18:34,972 --> 00:18:35,806
- You smell like Spain.
- We missed you!

226
00:18:35,806 --> 00:18:37,398
Is that what Spain smells like?

227
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,352
Stop, this is so embarrassing!

228
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,271
- Hide this. What the—
- Huh, why?

229
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:44,481
- Hide this. It’s embarrassing
- We worked hard on this. Look.

230
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:45,607
- We really put effort into this—
- Why—

231
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:46,900
- And now you want it hidden.
- Yeah, right.

232
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,901
- It’s beautiful.
- It’s really beautiful!

233
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:48,652
- So beautiful!
- Look at it.

234
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:49,445
Pretty, right?

235
00:18:49,445 --> 00:18:50,571
It’s so beautiful.

236
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,156
I missed you guys.

237
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,217
Hey, let’s go eat at the mall.

238
00:18:55,242 --> 00:18:57,786
Oh yeah. Sevi and Yanna
are going there too.

239
00:18:58,459 --> 00:18:59,251
Let’s go.

240
00:18:59,276 --> 00:19:00,222
Oh!

241
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:02,374
Who’s this handsome guy?

242
00:19:04,668 --> 00:19:06,503
- Let’s go.
- Come on.

243
00:19:06,503 --> 00:19:07,129
Fine.

244
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:08,297
Wait, my suitcase—

245
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:10,107
- I’ll hold on to it.
- Her bag might fall off—

246
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:12,718
Yeah, we’ll hold it. Come on!

247
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:13,719
- Careful now.
- Be careful with that.

248
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,679
- Be careful. I’m sorry. That’s heavy.
- Yes, I got it.

249
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,680
Oh my gosh.

250
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,724
Via, you have to tell me
about your love life there.

251
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,226
So, have you already given
in to the Spaniards?

252
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,770
Are they good? Are they big?
Oh my gosh!

253
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,146
Hey, Luna! Seriously…

254
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:26,064
I don’t have time for that.

255
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:26,940
It’s all just work.

256
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,734
Huh? Why? Don’t you
get bored there?

257
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:29,610
Right?

258
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,195
They say there are a lot
of handsome guys there.

259
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:32,112
True.

260
00:19:32,112 --> 00:19:34,448
But it’s not like I’m looking
for good-looking guys.

261
00:19:34,448 --> 00:19:35,783
I’m not interested.

262
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:38,035
I’m really just focused
on work there.

263
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:38,911
Really?

264
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,079
And I don’t want to flirt.

265
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,457
Life doesn’t revolve around flirting.

266
00:19:45,626 --> 00:19:46,835
I can’t relate.

267
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:48,462
I’m just kidding.

268
00:19:48,462 --> 00:19:50,005
I got it. All right, fine.

269
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:51,006
Okay.

270
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:54,301
By the way, your ex
is super famous here.

271
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:56,053
You know, we don’t even get
to hang out with him anymore.

272
00:19:56,053 --> 00:19:57,805
Even Sevi barely
gets to see him.

273
00:19:57,805 --> 00:19:59,014
Actually, that’s true.

274
00:19:59,014 --> 00:20:02,059
You know, when he
switched agencies,

275
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:04,144
his opportunities
really exploded.

276
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:07,898
Now he’s mostly focused on
music rather than acting.

277
00:20:07,898 --> 00:20:09,066
- Right?
- Yeah.

278
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:10,526
And then he even
had a concert.

279
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:12,528
It was awesome!
Tickets were sold out!

280
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:13,987
He even did a world tour.

281
00:20:13,987 --> 00:20:15,864
Shit. So cool!

282
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:18,033
Our solo artist is
really something, huh?

283
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,701
Good for him.

284
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:23,580
Also, I heard he has
a movie with Clea.

285
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,414
It’s a new movie.

286
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:26,083
Yeah, like their
comeback movie,

287
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,168
and people are excited.

288
00:20:28,335 --> 00:20:30,087
It’s been so long since
they last did anything, right?

289
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:33,215
You’ve got a lot
of updates, huh, Luna?

290
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:34,675
I don’t even want
to hear about it.

291
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:38,011
Yeah, she’s not interested,
so stop it.

292
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:39,763
- Let’s go.
- All right, I’ll shut up.

293
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:40,264
Come on.

294
00:20:40,264 --> 00:20:41,223
- Come on.
- Come on.

295
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:41,974
All right, fine.

296
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:42,975
- Come on.
- Don’t get mad.

297
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:43,475
So, really nothing?

298
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:49,815
Are you guys hungry?

299
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,984
- Yes.
- Tell me about it. I’m so hungry!

300
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:53,569
- Hi!
- Hi!

301
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:55,696
Wow, Via. I thought
you were a celebrity.

302
00:20:55,696 --> 00:20:57,531
- Your skin is flawless!
- You guys are early. Hi!

303
00:20:57,531 --> 00:21:00,158
Clearly coming from
a country with no polluted air.

304
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,911
[In Spanish] How are you, miss?

305
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:05,080
You’re annoying, Sevi!

306
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,540
Right? Seeing him now

307
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,327
just ruined my day.

308
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,835
Oh my gosh, same.

309
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,712
I just saw him.
No more. I’m done.

310
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:14,089
You guys are too much.

311
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:16,147
All right. I won’t
bother you guys.

312
00:21:17,168 --> 00:21:18,502
I’ll try to do better.

313
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:20,429
Such a sad boy.

314
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:21,638
So dramatic.

315
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:22,306
- Sad boy.
- Geez.

316
00:21:22,306 --> 00:21:23,307
He’s saying so much again.

317
00:21:23,307 --> 00:21:24,975
- All right, fine.
- Look at that face!

318
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:28,020
Bullies! It’s just Sam and
Avi on my side now,

319
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,563
and the other
one isn’t even here.

320
00:21:30,814 --> 00:21:31,565
Say, hi.

321
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:33,775
Avi!

322
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:36,528
Hello, Aunt Via! Welcome back.

323
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,947
I missed you.
How have you been?

324
00:21:38,947 --> 00:21:40,699
You keep getting taller, huh.

325
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,326
At this rate, we’ll be
the same height.

326
00:21:43,243 --> 00:21:43,952
Hey, Avi.

327
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:45,829
Show Aunt Via
what I taught you.

328
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:46,842
Come on.

329
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,964
Got something for me?

330
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:52,242
You’re teaching her
all kinds of nonsense.

331
00:21:52,336 --> 00:21:53,503
Ouch. Gag—

332
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:55,172
Gag reflex.

333
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:56,173
Right!

334
00:21:57,345 --> 00:21:58,471
- Hey!
- Oh.

335
00:21:58,592 --> 00:22:00,469
Look, it’s my dude, Larkin.

336
00:22:00,469 --> 00:22:01,803
He’s here to welcome you.

337
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:05,012
Stop being silly.

338
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,745
Mommy, let’s take a
picture with Uncle Arkin.

339
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,873
Sure. Baby, go on,
stand there.

340
00:22:11,188 --> 00:22:12,147
Wow.

341
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:12,940
A picture with Uncle Arkin.

342
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,690
- There you go.
- Smile.

343
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,983
With Uncle Sevi too, okay?

344
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:15,776
Okay, smile!

345
00:22:15,776 --> 00:22:18,779
- One, two, smile!
- Why’d you join too, Sevi?

346
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:20,405
You weirdo.

347
00:22:20,948 --> 00:22:22,824
- You?
- Me?

348
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:23,725
No.

349
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:25,285
Come on now. Let’s go inside.

350
00:22:25,285 --> 00:22:27,412
I miss Uncle Arkin.

351
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:30,791
I rarely see him nowadays.

352
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:34,544
Baby, your Uncle Arkin is busy.

353
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:38,006
Come on, let’s eat.

354
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:38,966
- Okay, let’s eat.
- All right!

355
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:40,717
Come on now.
We’ll go ahead.

356
00:22:40,717 --> 00:22:42,636
- I really need to pee, too.
- Avi’s already hungry.

357
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:43,553
Okay, I’ll follow.

358
00:22:43,553 --> 00:22:44,554
Okay.

359
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:48,141
Could it be that
I’m one of the reasons

360
00:22:48,141 --> 00:22:50,310
they don’t get to hang out
with Arkin anymore?

361
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,146
Did he distance himself
from the group because of me?

362
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,357
That makes mefeel really guilty.

363
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:59,319
I feel like I’m the one who
ruined our friend group.

364
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:02,364
Our breakup kind of forced
Arkin to leave the circle.

365
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:04,950
I just hope he still has
someone to talk to

366
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,702
when things get hard.

367
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:15,752
I’m hungry already.

368
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:16,712
Isn’t there anything else—

369
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:17,713
It’s taking so long.

370
00:23:17,713 --> 00:23:18,797
Hey, can I borrow that for now?

371
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,799
We’re getting really hungry now.

372
00:23:21,795 --> 00:23:23,956
This is starting to get annoying.

373
00:23:23,981 --> 00:23:27,109
Ever since I arrived,
all I keep seeing is his face.

374
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,266
Look at my dude, Larkin.

375
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:30,892
He even has a bundle deal.

376
00:23:31,268 --> 00:23:32,936
Wow.

377
00:23:32,936 --> 00:23:35,772
You really picked the
wrong restaurant, Sevi.

378
00:23:35,772 --> 00:23:37,899
How was I supposed to know
he’s an endorser here?

379
00:23:39,943 --> 00:23:41,153
But wait, Via…

380
00:23:41,528 --> 00:23:43,864
Have you not moved on
from Larkin yet?

381
00:23:45,852 --> 00:23:46,908
Huh?

382
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:48,243
That was a long time ago.

383
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:50,269
I’m fine now.
Of course, I’ve moved on.

384
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:52,622
Okay.

385
00:23:52,622 --> 00:23:53,730
So...

386
00:23:54,124 --> 00:23:56,585
we can invite Arkin here now?

387
00:23:58,211 --> 00:24:00,839
Sure. Invite him if you want.

388
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,217
But what if Arkin’s the one
who hasn’t moved on yet?

389
00:24:04,217 --> 00:24:07,679
He might totally lose it
when he sees Via here.

390
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,182
Are you saying Arkin
hasn’t moved on yet?

391
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,016
No.

392
00:24:11,224 --> 00:24:12,893
No, I’m just saying maybe.

393
00:24:12,893 --> 00:24:14,311
You never know, he might’ve
moved on already.

394
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:16,646
Via said that it was
a long time ago.

395
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:19,149
And because of that,
let’s just invite Sam instead.

396
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:20,484
Call her. Isn’t she in New York?

397
00:24:20,484 --> 00:24:21,621
Hey, call her.

398
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,863
My phone’s charging!

399
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,114
Mine too.

400
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:27,115
No. Let’s order first.

401
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:28,325
Waiter! Sir…

402
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:33,919
Do we get a discount if
we know the endorser here?

403
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,000
Can we order him instead?

404
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,543
- Yes.
- The endorser himself.

405
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,377
Sure.

406
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:40,420
- Is that okay?
- They said it’s okay.

407
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,922
Where is he?
They’re looking for—

408
00:24:41,922 --> 00:24:43,548
- She’s looking for him.
- There he is. That’s him.

409
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,801
- Come on now. Be serious.
- No, I’m just joking.

410
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:47,969
One what, Bundle A, B, C.

411
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,082
Is it your treat?

412
00:24:54,434 --> 00:24:55,644
There. These are the clothes,

413
00:24:55,644 --> 00:24:58,522
and those are
the groceries I bought.

414
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,607
That’s a lot, sweetheart.

415
00:25:00,607 --> 00:25:02,776
You didn’t spend all your
salary on gifts, did you?

416
00:25:02,776 --> 00:25:04,027
Oh no, Pa. No.

417
00:25:04,027 --> 00:25:05,946
Some of those
are from Auntie, too.

418
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,864
Thank you, Via.

419
00:25:07,864 --> 00:25:09,616
I’ve got something
nice to wear now.

420
00:25:09,783 --> 00:25:10,826
Is it like that?

421
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:12,953
You just have a classmate
you’re trying to impress.

422
00:25:12,953 --> 00:25:13,954
No, I don’t.

423
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,040
Aidan’s a big boy now.

424
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,958
- He has a crush on someone.
- Big boy!

425
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:19,347
I don’t, okay?

426
00:25:19,626 --> 00:25:21,628
So, how long are
you staying here?

427
00:25:21,628 --> 00:25:23,713
Do you plan on
working here again?

428
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,716
Just until the project
is finished, Dad.

429
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:28,802
That’ll probably take a few months.

430
00:25:28,802 --> 00:25:30,846
Well, I hope the project
takes a long time

431
00:25:30,846 --> 00:25:33,014
so we can have you here longer.

432
00:25:33,731 --> 00:25:35,274
You brought this too, Via?

433
00:25:39,396 --> 00:25:40,449
Oh.

434
00:25:40,564 --> 00:25:42,357
There’s another guitar here.

435
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:43,511
Who does that belong to?

436
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:47,779
That’s Mr. Benito’s, our neighbor.

437
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:50,136
I borrowed it because
I’m learning how to play.

438
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:53,326
You’re learning?

439
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:54,869
Someone teaching you?

440
00:25:55,996 --> 00:25:59,124
No. I’m learning
from online videos.

441
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:02,460
But since you’re here now,
you can teach me.

442
00:26:04,254 --> 00:26:06,230
Of course. I’ll teach you.

443
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:08,049
And we’ll also buy you
your own guitar

444
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:09,526
so you’ll have one.

445
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:11,011
There’s no need, it’s too much.

446
00:26:11,011 --> 00:26:13,013
You already brought me
so many gifts.

447
00:26:13,722 --> 00:26:14,598
It’s all right.

448
00:26:14,598 --> 00:26:17,225
It’s your reward for
getting high grades.

449
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:18,476
- Wow.
- Thank you, Via.

450
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:19,111
- Wow.
- Nice.

451
00:26:19,136 --> 00:26:21,313
If Aidan wants to pursue music,

452
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,731
I want to support him,
because that’s something

453
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:24,958
I wasn’t able to do
before with Arkin.

454
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,110
Aidan, just put the guitar
in the bedroom, okay?

455
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:28,652
Okay.

456
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:31,448
This goes in the fridge.

457
00:26:31,448 --> 00:26:33,241
- This is my favorite.
- That’s a lot, Via.

458
00:26:33,497 --> 00:26:34,628
What does that taste like?

459
00:27:01,895 --> 00:27:03,271
It’s so annoying.

460
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:04,397
Even in my own room,

461
00:27:04,397 --> 00:27:06,399
there are so many
reminders of him.

462
00:27:25,835 --> 00:27:28,922
Maybe I need to rearrange things

463
00:27:28,922 --> 00:27:30,840
so there’s no trace of him left.

464
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:55,876
Hi. I’m looking for Ms. Marj Garcia.

465
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,319
Sure, ma’am.
Please have a seat.

466
00:28:57,344 --> 00:28:58,444
Thank you.

467
00:29:02,682 --> 00:29:04,225
Architect Diaz?

468
00:29:04,225 --> 00:29:04,809
Hi!

469
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,144
- Hi, ma’am. Hello.
- Finally.

470
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,019
Hi. Hello.

471
00:29:08,396 --> 00:29:09,689
Everyone,

472
00:29:10,523 --> 00:29:12,650
meet Architect Avianna Diaz.

473
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,486
She’s one of
the architects handling

474
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,404
the Bulacan Airport Project.

475
00:29:16,404 --> 00:29:19,240
And she’s from Cuesta Architects
Barcelona branch—

476
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,493
and she’s one
of the top architects there

477
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,745
so I know we’re in good hands.

478
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:25,863
Thank you so much, ma’am.

479
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,999
Hi, nice to meet everyone.

480
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,918
I’m excited to work with all of you.

481
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,920
Same here, Architect.

482
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:35,090
This airport renovation
project is a big one,

483
00:29:35,115 --> 00:29:38,451
and I’m glad they sent
someone skilled to help us.

484
00:29:39,552 --> 00:29:43,890
Well, that’s a lot of pressure,
but I’ll do my best.

485
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:48,353
So, tell me, how’s your stay in Spain?

486
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,379
Yeah.

487
00:29:52,518 --> 00:29:53,519
It’s okay.

488
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:55,568
Good.

489
00:29:58,071 --> 00:29:59,364
Is that Clea?

490
00:29:59,572 --> 00:30:00,990
Yes. That’s her.

491
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,575
She’s our big client.

492
00:30:02,575 --> 00:30:06,121
And she’s looking for an architect
to design her new house.

493
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:17,293
What a small world.

494
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:27,725
Via, no backing out, okay?

495
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,352
You’re going to buy me a guitar.

496
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:33,456
Pick the guitar you want
before I change my mind.

497
00:30:33,481 --> 00:30:36,860
Actually, I’ve had my eye
on a guitar here for a while.

498
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,153
There, see?

499
00:30:38,653 --> 00:30:39,237
This one, sir?

500
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,947
Yeah. Please.

501
00:30:43,077 --> 00:30:44,286
It’s nice.

502
00:30:44,492 --> 00:30:45,869
Come on, sir,
let’s try the guitar.

503
00:30:45,869 --> 00:30:46,885
Take a look.

504
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:04,220
Should I buy it?

505
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:06,306
I don’t really use it.

506
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,975
All right, fine,
since I’m here anyway.

507
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:12,270
I’ll also get Aidan a pick.

508
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,112
Aidan?

509
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,699
Aidan, do you need a capo—

510
00:31:54,187 --> 00:31:55,813
Go ahead and take the guitar.

511
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:56,981
Let’s pay, Aidan.

512
00:31:58,441 --> 00:31:59,484
Okay.

513
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:00,902
Take care, Arkin.

514
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:12,764
This, too, please.

515
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,294
Total of 13,800, ma’am.

516
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,552
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

517
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:30,782
There. All set.

518
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:32,183
Thanks. Let’s go.

519
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:33,037
Yup.

520
00:32:34,435 --> 00:32:35,490
Let’s go.

521
00:32:35,728 --> 00:32:36,813
Hey, miss.

522
00:32:39,148 --> 00:32:40,608
You forgot something.

523
00:32:52,745 --> 00:32:53,746
Thank you.

524
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:55,790
Take care, Aidan.

525
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:03,965
I thought I wouldn’t be
surprised anymore

526
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:05,383
seeing him in person,

527
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:08,511
since I see his face
everywhere all the time.

528
00:33:09,178 --> 00:33:11,806
And did he reallyjust call me miss,

529
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:14,183
like I don’t evenhave a name?

530
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:15,768
Let’s go…

531
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:17,020
Miss.

532
00:33:21,691 --> 00:33:22,692
Come on.

533
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:30,742
There. What chord is that?

534
00:33:31,284 --> 00:33:32,035
G.

535
00:33:32,035 --> 00:33:33,786
That’s it. Strum it.

536
00:33:51,971 --> 00:33:55,141
Did he inherit
Mama’s musical talent?

537
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,751
He learns so fast.

538
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,189
Admit it.

539
00:34:01,814 --> 00:34:03,608
Have you been taught already?

540
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:04,859
Taught?

541
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,696
Taught how to play
the guitar before.

542
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,783
I actually learned
from Arkin before.

543
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:14,911
I ran into him at the music store

544
00:34:14,911 --> 00:34:17,455
when I was looking
for the guitar I wanted.

545
00:34:17,775 --> 00:34:20,411
He goes there a lot because
that’s where he buys his stuff, too.

546
00:34:23,336 --> 00:34:25,213
And you brought me there?

547
00:34:25,922 --> 00:34:28,007
I didn’t mean to, Via.

548
00:34:28,007 --> 00:34:30,385
I also didn’t know he would
go there yesterday.

549
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:35,390
And just because you’re
no longer a couple,

550
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,684
that doesn’t mean
we lost our connection.

551
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,978
He’s been a good older
brother to us, too, Via.

552
00:34:43,106 --> 00:34:45,525
That’s the hard part with
my relationship with Larkin.

553
00:34:45,525 --> 00:34:49,028
We got too close
to each other’s families.

554
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,783
I can’t really blame my siblings.

555
00:34:53,783 --> 00:34:56,619
It’s fine with me if they
still talk to each other.

556
00:34:56,619 --> 00:34:59,497
That’s what I want
for my friends, too,

557
00:34:59,789 --> 00:35:02,333
but Arkin is the one distancing
himself from them.

558
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:05,795
I feel bad that he had to lose
friends just because of me.

559
00:35:09,882 --> 00:35:10,967
All right.

560
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:13,636
Just play something for me

561
00:35:13,636 --> 00:35:15,263
so I can hear what
you can already play

562
00:35:15,263 --> 00:35:16,264
and know where to
start teaching you.

563
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:17,265
Okay.

564
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:20,059
Later, I’ll help you with
a room makeover, okay?

565
00:35:20,309 --> 00:35:20,810
Sure.

566
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:21,820
All right.

567
00:35:33,156 --> 00:35:35,078
You already know how to play.

568
00:35:36,784 --> 00:35:37,785
Excuse me.

569
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:40,371
There you go, Via.

570
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:41,998
Your room looks amazing now.

571
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,419
Thanks for all your help, guys.

572
00:35:46,669 --> 00:35:50,256
Why did you suddenly decide
to rearrange your room, Via?

573
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,049
It looks completely different.

574
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,875
A breath of fresh air.

575
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:55,928
And I’m an architect, remember?

576
00:35:55,928 --> 00:35:58,306
I want my space to be organized.

577
00:35:58,598 --> 00:36:01,267
Via, I noticed you look skinnier now.

578
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:04,103
Probably because you’ve been
exercising a lot in Spain, huh?

579
00:36:04,103 --> 00:36:06,481
Exercise? No.

580
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:07,815
Just walking.

581
00:36:07,815 --> 00:36:11,360
In Spain, everything
is so walkable,

582
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,406
and wherever you look,
it’s beautiful.

583
00:36:15,698 --> 00:36:18,093
I hope I get to go there too.

584
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:20,828
Of course. Come here,
I missed you all.

585
00:36:22,955 --> 00:36:25,583
You’ll be able to go
there too. I’ll take you.

586
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,918
Really, Via?

587
00:36:27,335 --> 00:36:30,379
Of course!
You’ll get to go anywhere.

588
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:32,256
Just study well, okay?

589
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,301
And I’m sure that
wherever you want to go,

590
00:36:35,301 --> 00:36:36,552
you’ll get there.

591
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:39,639
I promise, I’ll study hard

592
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:42,975
so all the effort you put into
our education won’t go to waste.

593
00:36:42,975 --> 00:36:45,269
Only the last two
years of college left!

594
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,921
Me too, Via!
I’ll make you proud, too.

595
00:36:48,189 --> 00:36:51,275
I’ll work even harder, Via,

596
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,778
so I can help you and Papa.

597
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,488
You’re so inspiring.

598
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:57,937
I’m so proud of you all.

599
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:03,496
And I’m sure you’ll achieve
even more than I have.

600
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:06,332
But promise me, okay?

601
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:10,670
That you’ll put your own dreams first.

602
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:12,630
Yes, Via.

603
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,756
- Okay?
- We promise.

604
00:37:13,756 --> 00:37:15,049
I missed you guys. Come here.

605
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:16,467
We missed you, too.

606
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,135
Wow, you’re so sexy now, Via.

607
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:19,929
- Wow.
- Oh, come on, you guys!

608
00:37:19,929 --> 00:37:20,721
Wow!

609
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:21,889
Wow. She’s really sexy.

610
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:23,307
And you,
have you been good?

611
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:24,600
– Maybe not.
- Yeah, why?

612
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,828
He’s picking on me.

613
00:37:26,102 --> 00:37:26,727
Wait, why—

614
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:27,728
Are you—

615
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,981
Are you two fighting?

616
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:30,898
No.

617
00:37:30,898 --> 00:37:32,400
I missed you all.

618
00:37:39,198 --> 00:37:40,074
You can do this, Via.

619
00:37:40,074 --> 00:37:41,492
Just finish this project,

620
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,226
and then you’ll be back in Spain.

621
00:37:43,286 --> 00:37:44,304
You can do this.

622
00:37:48,624 --> 00:37:49,750
Okay—

623
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,793
Can I see?

624
00:37:52,378 --> 00:37:53,379
Okay. This looks right.

625
00:37:53,379 --> 00:37:56,465
But let’s just make sure the
quality of the materials we’ll use

626
00:37:56,465 --> 00:37:57,884
matches what
we discussed, okay?

627
00:37:57,884 --> 00:38:00,469
Then we’ll follow up with
the engineers on the presentation

628
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:02,763
so we can proceed.

629
00:38:02,805 --> 00:38:03,806
Yes, ma’am.

630
00:38:05,975 --> 00:38:08,811
I’m planning a European
structural style.

631
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:13,671
Good thing we’re not working together.

632
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,654
It might get awkward.

633
00:38:21,115 --> 00:38:23,242
There’s apparently
a high school batch reunion.

634
00:38:23,242 --> 00:38:24,289
Are you going?

635
00:38:29,749 --> 00:38:32,877
I’ll think about it.
I might be busy with projects.

636
00:38:38,341 --> 00:38:39,592
Architect Diaz?

637
00:38:39,592 --> 00:38:41,052
Can you come with me?

638
00:38:41,677 --> 00:38:42,887
Yes, ma’am. Sure.

639
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:48,826
Hmmm...

640
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:49,936
What’s this about?

641
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:52,271
Please excuse me.

642
00:38:58,361 --> 00:38:59,253
Hi, ma’am.

643
00:38:59,278 --> 00:39:01,030
Please sit down, Architect Diaz.

644
00:39:05,493 --> 00:39:07,036
How can I help?

645
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:11,707
Are you open to taking on
an additional project?

646
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:15,586
Huh?

647
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:18,965
I’m asking because
we have our VIP client here,

648
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:21,384
the famous actress, Clea Aguilar.

649
00:39:21,384 --> 00:39:24,178
She’s looking for an architect
to design her house.

650
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,367
Hi, I’m Architect Diaz.

651
00:39:29,392 --> 00:39:30,434
Hello. Clea.

652
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:31,456
Hi.

653
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,732
Clea wants a European-style house,

654
00:39:36,732 --> 00:39:38,901
and I realized that it’s your forte.

655
00:39:39,235 --> 00:39:41,904
You see, Architect Diaz is originally

656
00:39:41,904 --> 00:39:43,447
from our branch in Spain.

657
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,366
She’s one of the best over there.

658
00:39:45,366 --> 00:39:48,494
That’s why she was sent here
to Manila for a big project.

659
00:39:50,746 --> 00:39:53,582
So, Architect Diaz, what do you think?

660
00:39:53,582 --> 00:39:55,167
Are you up for the challenge?

661
00:39:57,378 --> 00:39:58,379
Ma’am—

662
00:40:02,262 --> 00:40:03,799
It’s fine, Marj.

663
00:40:04,093 --> 00:40:07,805
I think Architect Diaz has
her hands full right now.

664
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:08,389
It's fine.

665
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:11,767
What a shame, Architect.
I think you’d be perfect for this.

666
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:13,602
Don’t worry about the workload.

667
00:40:13,602 --> 00:40:15,646
We’ll be partnering you
with Architect Herran,

668
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:16,939
so it won’t be too heavy.

669
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,151
This opportunity is too good to pass up.

670
00:40:22,278 --> 00:40:23,571
Avianna,

671
00:40:23,571 --> 00:40:26,574
stop letting your
personal feelings affect your work.

672
00:40:26,574 --> 00:40:28,826
You need the money
for your family.

673
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:31,287
You’re helping Papa
put your siblings through school,

674
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:34,040
so you don’t have
the right to turn this down.

675
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:37,126
Architect Diaz?

676
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,315
I will take it, Ma’am.

677
00:40:43,426 --> 00:40:44,567
Great!

678
00:40:44,662 --> 00:40:46,664
I think Clea is
available tomorrow.

679
00:40:47,063 --> 00:40:49,149
You can meet
and discuss the details.

680
00:40:49,388 --> 00:40:50,222
Great.

681
00:40:50,222 --> 00:40:51,724
Excuse me,
I’ll just take this call.

682
00:40:53,225 --> 00:40:54,226
Yes?

683
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:12,620
Via—

684
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,958
I hope doing this project doesn’t
make you uncomfortable.

685
00:41:18,307 --> 00:41:20,836
I know there were things
that happened before and I—

686
00:41:20,836 --> 00:41:22,880
Oh, no. It’s totally fine.

687
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,092
And let’s just leave
everything behind.

688
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:28,344
I’m really happy that we’re
doing this together now.

689
00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:30,554
All right.

690
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:31,557
Perfect!

691
00:41:31,847 --> 00:41:33,682
Okay. So, I’ll see you soon.

692
00:41:33,933 --> 00:41:34,963
Yeah.

693
00:41:35,267 --> 00:41:36,268
I’ll go ahead.

694
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:39,955
Thank you so much for
accepting the project.

695
00:41:40,089 --> 00:41:42,091
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the trust.

696
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,459
Bye!

697
00:41:43,484 --> 00:41:44,485
Bye.

698
00:41:57,623 --> 00:41:59,542
Why did I accept that?

699
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,629
But they said I’ll just
be helping anyway.

700
00:42:04,463 --> 00:42:06,173
Yeah, that’s my forte.

701
00:42:06,173 --> 00:42:08,175
I’m used to that kind of design.

702
00:42:08,342 --> 00:42:09,385
Right.

703
00:42:09,385 --> 00:42:11,095
It’ll only be for a short time.

704
00:42:11,971 --> 00:42:14,849
This is for my siblings
and for Papa.

705
00:42:18,352 --> 00:42:19,436
It’s just temporary.

706
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,522
Just work, nothing else.

707
00:42:32,741 --> 00:42:33,742
Thank you.

708
00:42:35,327 --> 00:42:37,288
Okay. So for the exteriors,

709
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,957
I want a European countryside feel.

710
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:42,042
Maybe think Spanish farmhouses.

711
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:45,379
Lots of stone details,
warm and earthy tones.

712
00:42:46,046 --> 00:42:48,007
But I also want to see
your take on it, too.

713
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:49,842
Your vision, Architect.

714
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:57,391
I’m thinking we can still
do more landscaping here.

715
00:42:57,647 --> 00:43:00,942
And is the size of
the pool okay for you?

716
00:43:07,276 --> 00:43:10,404
I think I can finish the sketches
and the full concept

717
00:43:10,404 --> 00:43:12,156
in about two weeks.
Would that be okay?

718
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,073
Perfect!

719
00:43:13,073 --> 00:43:14,950
I’ll be busy with filming,

720
00:43:15,075 --> 00:43:18,454
but I’ll message you where
we can meet for the design.

721
00:43:18,787 --> 00:43:21,665
Yeah. You can message me here.

722
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,392
You can contact me anytime.

723
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:26,003
All right. Thank you so much.

724
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,088
Also, please don’t hesitate
to message me

725
00:43:28,088 --> 00:43:30,466
if the schedule gets tight.

726
00:43:31,023 --> 00:43:32,483
I don’t wanna overwork you.

727
00:43:33,928 --> 00:43:36,483
Sure, thanks. Okay.

728
00:43:36,508 --> 00:43:39,511
Just to finalize—

729
00:43:42,144 --> 00:43:44,605
I worked on this for several days.

730
00:43:44,897 --> 00:43:46,982
A house isn’t just a project.

731
00:43:47,316 --> 00:43:48,901
This is a home.

732
00:43:48,901 --> 00:43:51,695
Someone will live here
and make memories.

733
00:43:52,905 --> 00:43:55,282
So even if it’s hard
and exhausting,

734
00:43:55,282 --> 00:43:58,410
I have to give it my all to
make it feel like home.

735
00:44:09,338 --> 00:44:12,174
Hi, sorry. I have a
shoot this Friday.

736
00:44:12,174 --> 00:44:15,302
Can we meet at a cafe near
our shooting location?

737
00:44:23,143 --> 00:44:25,187
Okay. No worries.

738
00:44:25,187 --> 00:44:26,355
See you.

739
00:44:35,948 --> 00:44:38,158
Let me present to you,

740
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:40,119
Casa Aguilar.

741
00:44:42,204 --> 00:44:43,622
Here’s the other side.

742
00:44:44,498 --> 00:44:46,208
There. What do you think?

743
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,418
I love it!

744
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:50,296
It really feels like a Spanish
farmhouse in Manila.

745
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,674
Though, I just have
a few comments.

746
00:44:53,674 --> 00:44:57,511
So, maybe the outdoor patio
could be a little bit wider.

747
00:44:57,511 --> 00:44:58,053
Okay.

748
00:44:58,053 --> 00:45:00,055
Since we do have the
square footage after all.

749
00:45:00,055 --> 00:45:00,723
Okay.

750
00:45:00,723 --> 00:45:02,891
And then just
a reminder about the—

751
00:45:02,891 --> 00:45:04,310
- the living room.
- Okay.

752
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,728
I want it a little bit bigger.

753
00:45:05,728 --> 00:45:07,104
- That’s it.
- Okay. Got it.

754
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:11,391
Anything else?

755
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:12,776
That’s it.

756
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,030
- Okay.
- It’s so pretty.

757
00:45:18,824 --> 00:45:19,633
It’s taking so long.

758
00:45:19,658 --> 00:45:20,676
Shit.

759
00:45:20,701 --> 00:45:21,672
Hey!

760
00:45:22,536 --> 00:45:23,704
Are they still setting up?

761
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:25,664
Yeah. That’s why
I stepped out for a bit.

762
00:45:26,165 --> 00:45:27,166
Okay.

763
00:45:27,499 --> 00:45:29,376
Can you get my order,
the croissant,

764
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:31,128
from the counter, please?

765
00:45:34,256 --> 00:45:35,549
Real bossy now, huh?

766
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:37,825
Okay. Sure, madam.

767
00:45:37,926 --> 00:45:39,553
Thank you.

768
00:45:41,513 --> 00:45:43,140
Are they a couple now?

769
00:45:44,433 --> 00:45:45,891
I’m sorry. Where were we?

770
00:45:47,353 --> 00:45:50,105
If you have
any more comments…

771
00:45:50,105 --> 00:45:51,844
No. That’s all.

772
00:45:52,107 --> 00:45:53,442
Just a few comments.
That’s it.

773
00:45:53,442 --> 00:45:54,376
Okay.

774
00:45:54,401 --> 00:45:55,944
Sir, Clea’s order please?

775
00:45:55,944 --> 00:45:57,154
Please wait—

776
00:45:57,571 --> 00:46:01,533
Architect, your idea is spot on.

777
00:46:02,714 --> 00:46:04,461
You really got exactly what I want.

778
00:46:05,245 --> 00:46:07,247
I think we have the same taste.

779
00:46:12,294 --> 00:46:14,213
Here’s your order, ma’am.

780
00:46:14,213 --> 00:46:15,313
Thank you.

781
00:46:15,419 --> 00:46:16,586
Shit. I’m sorry.

782
00:46:18,717 --> 00:46:19,843
- Are you okay?
- You okay?

783
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:22,679
- I’m okay. I’m fine.
- Are you okay?

784
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,348
- Do you have ice? Sir?
- No. It’s all right.

785
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:25,224
Are you okay?

786
00:46:25,224 --> 00:46:26,642
- I’m okay, it’s all right.
- Get some ice, please!

787
00:46:26,642 --> 00:46:27,184
Yes, sir.

788
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:28,435
- It’s all right.
- Please wait...

789
00:46:28,435 --> 00:46:29,353
- I’m okay.
- Are you okay?

790
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:30,479
Yeah, I’m okay. Don’t worry.

791
00:46:30,479 --> 00:46:31,480
Are you sure?

792
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,481
- Yeah!
- Okay.

793
00:46:32,481 --> 00:46:34,316
It’s all right. I’m okay.

794
00:46:34,608 --> 00:46:35,649
Wait a minute.

795
00:46:36,235 --> 00:46:37,361
Lea is calling.

796
00:46:38,237 --> 00:46:39,281
Our producer.

797
00:46:39,655 --> 00:46:40,656
I’m sorry.

798
00:46:41,448 --> 00:46:43,242
Yes, Lea?

799
00:46:43,242 --> 00:46:44,453
We’re going back now.

800
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:45,524
Okay.

801
00:46:45,895 --> 00:46:46,896
I’m sorry.

802
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:50,791
We need to go, Clea.

803
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:52,251
The director is about to lose it.

804
00:46:52,251 --> 00:46:54,586
We need to finish all the sequences

805
00:46:54,586 --> 00:46:56,630
since we won’t have
a shoot until next week.

806
00:46:57,131 --> 00:46:58,340
Okay, got it.

807
00:46:58,538 --> 00:46:59,914
So, are you guys done?

808
00:46:59,955 --> 00:47:00,831
Yeah.

809
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:03,554
Thank you so much,
Architect, for today.

810
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:04,513
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

811
00:47:04,513 --> 00:47:05,848
- Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you.

812
00:47:05,848 --> 00:47:06,828
Thank you.

813
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:08,392
We’ll go ahead.

814
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:09,766
Yeah.

815
00:47:30,275 --> 00:47:31,276
Here.

816
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,916
Looks like the rain is getting heavy.

817
00:47:36,378 --> 00:47:37,129
Thank you.

818
00:47:37,129 --> 00:47:38,152
We’ll go ahead.

819
00:47:39,214 --> 00:47:40,215
Thank you.

820
00:47:49,641 --> 00:47:51,768
Did Arkin ask her to give this?

821
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:26,196
Just a quick glance.

822
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:31,413
Just one smile from you, and I’ll leave.

823
00:49:34,788 --> 00:49:37,332
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

824
00:50:08,655 --> 00:50:10,657
Why did you suddenly
ask me out for drinks?

825
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:12,242
Am I not allowed to?

826
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:13,744
Of course, I missed you, bro.

827
00:50:14,369 --> 00:50:16,788
We just don’t get
to see you anymore.

828
00:50:17,372 --> 00:50:19,958
By the way, Mom had
your favorite dish cooked,

829
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:20,709
it’s in the car.

830
00:50:20,709 --> 00:50:22,336
So you’d have something
to eat at the condo.

831
00:50:22,794 --> 00:50:24,630
Perfect timing.
I missed Auntie’s cooking.

832
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:26,326
Tell her thank you.

833
00:50:28,133 --> 00:50:32,888
By the way,
Via’s coming back to Manila.

834
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,557
Saturday. 11 AM. Terminal 3.

835
00:50:35,557 --> 00:50:38,585
Luna and Ke will pick her up.

836
00:50:38,977 --> 00:50:40,520
No big deal.

837
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,105
Just sharing, bro.

838
00:50:43,023 --> 00:50:46,401
All right, I’ll grab the food
so I can give it to you.

839
00:51:04,753 --> 00:51:05,754
Hi.

840
00:51:06,713 --> 00:51:09,811
Please cancel all my schedules
this Saturday morning.

841
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:11,718
Got some important errands.

842
00:51:13,053 --> 00:51:13,845
All of them, sir?

843
00:51:13,845 --> 00:51:14,897
All of them. Yes.

844
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:17,599
All right, sir. I’ll clear
your schedule on Saturday.

845
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:18,934
Thank you.

846
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,150
Come on.

847
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:27,818
- Come on.
- Come on.

848
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:28,527
All right, fine.

849
00:51:28,527 --> 00:51:29,528
- Come on.
- Don’t get mad.

850
00:51:29,528 --> 00:51:30,529
So, really nothing?

851
00:51:30,529 --> 00:51:31,530
- Nothing.
- Seriously?

852
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:40,330
Welcome home, Via.

853
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:47,963
Via, no backing out, okay?

854
00:51:47,963 --> 00:51:49,214
You’re going to buy me a guitar.

855
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:53,635
Pick the guitar you want
before I change my mind.

856
00:51:58,515 --> 00:51:59,641
Arkin?

857
00:51:59,641 --> 00:52:00,559
Hey! Aidan!

858
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:01,560
Arkin!

859
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,245
What’s this? Are you buying it?

860
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:04,563
Yes. This is the one I want.

861
00:52:04,563 --> 00:52:06,273
I already know how to play.
You taught me.

862
00:52:06,648 --> 00:52:08,275
- Can you help me out?
- Now you know how.

863
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:10,152
Don’t talk about… You know what.

864
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,737
- It’s a secret.
- It’s our secret.

865
00:52:11,737 --> 00:52:13,029
All right, then.

866
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:15,866
Who are you with?

867
00:52:17,784 --> 00:52:19,745
Aidan, do you need a capo—

868
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,425
Go ahead and take the guitar.

869
00:52:33,425 --> 00:52:34,593
Let’s pay, Aidan.

870
00:52:36,136 --> 00:52:37,179
Okay.

871
00:52:37,179 --> 00:52:38,263
Take care, Arkin.

872
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:53,987
There. All set.

873
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:54,952
Thanks.

874
00:52:55,322 --> 00:52:56,382
Let’s go.

875
00:52:59,229 --> 00:53:00,230
Hey, miss.

876
00:53:02,671 --> 00:53:03,963
You forgot something.

877
00:53:14,007 --> 00:53:15,046
Thank you.

878
00:53:16,134 --> 00:53:17,385
Take care, Aidan.

879
00:53:20,138 --> 00:53:21,139
Miss…

880
00:53:23,183 --> 00:53:24,226
I miss you.

881
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:44,037
Are you Architect Diaz?

882
00:53:44,037 --> 00:53:45,038
This way, please.

883
00:53:47,499 --> 00:53:48,500
And—

884
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:49,709
Three, two, one—

885
00:53:50,043 --> 00:53:51,044
Action!

886
00:53:53,048 --> 00:53:54,215
If that’s the case, then—

887
00:53:54,589 --> 00:53:55,590
Cut!

888
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:57,008
It’s terrible! Damn it!

889
00:53:57,008 --> 00:53:58,802
Arkin, what is happening to you?

890
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,763
I told you he’s not going.

891
00:54:03,557 --> 00:54:04,683
Hi!

892
00:54:06,935 --> 00:54:08,186
How are you?

893
00:54:08,808 --> 00:54:12,270
- Shot!
- Shot!

894
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,352
I’m sorry.

895
00:54:20,073 --> 00:54:20,949
I’ll see you on-site?

896
00:54:20,949 --> 00:54:22,325
What are you staring at?

897
00:54:22,534 --> 00:54:23,827
I’m changing.

898
00:54:23,852 --> 00:54:25,126
This is the dressing room, remember?
