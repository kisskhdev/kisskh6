00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.019
Hawthorn

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.299
Red bean

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.599
Orange

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.040
They were all three cents

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:00.019
Cream

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:01.060
Two-color

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:01.920
Chocolate

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.500
They were all five cents

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:04.819
My memory is flawless

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.019
That's not right

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:08.099
The two-color popsicle was

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.000
three cents a stick

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.800
You remember it wrong

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.159
I remember it wrong

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.620
Impossible

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.319
I have a nickname

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.099
"Never Forget"

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.319
Ms. Liu

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.020
You be the judge

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.020
I also remember it being five cents

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:23.340
See

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.379
I remember it was three cents

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:26.520
See

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:27.539
Muddlehead

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:28.020
Stubborn mule

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.319
Muddlehead

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.620
Grandpas, stop arguing

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.280
It's just a popsicle

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.379
I'll buy them for you

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.620
One for each of you

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.439
Is that okay

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:37.419
It's not about the popsicle

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.639
It's about proving my memory is good

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.460
Unlike some people

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.819
Who are glued to a computer all day

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:43.939
You think I can't use one

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.360
You know how to use it

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.819
My brain works better than a computer

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:47.719
Why would I use that thing

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:49.460
President Li

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:51.479
Jiajia asked you to reply to her WeChat

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.939
No

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:56.560
Where did I leave my phone

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.539
And you call that a good memory

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:59.719
Let me ask you then

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.520
Yesterday, did you play Mahjong first or

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.439
go fishing

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.080
Then the 500 yuan you owe me

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.860
When are you paying it back

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:11.960
Once I find the phone

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:12.479
Good

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.379
When did I ever owe you money

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.439
Is the two-color popsicle five cents

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.960
President Li

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.780
Let me introduce you

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.060
This is

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.360
Mr. Lv Tienan

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.319
He was sent by the company

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.099
to visit all you executives

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.500
Mr. Li

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:33.500
Hello.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.500
Why are you shouting?

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.099
I'm not hard of hearing.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.400
Not hard of hearing, huh.

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:39.159
Little Ma sent you, right?

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:40.280
Yes.

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:41.120
Right.

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.139
It's, uh, well...

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.139
Mr. Ma sent me.

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.060
Mr. Ma mentions you often.

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:45.800
He says you...

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.580
...are a great hero of the company.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.639
Really?

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:49.680
Really.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.919
That sounds more like it.

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:53.219
What else did he say?

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.020
He also said...

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.020
He also said...

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.800
Mr. Ma said that you...

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.599
...have worked hard and achieved much.

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:01.879
And have a wealth of experience.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.439
Right.

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:04.159
He said you...

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.139
...led our company through its growth.

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.400
You must be full of valuable experience.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.979
Isn't that right?

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.780
He said you're probably idle...

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.620
...and should take these experiences...

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.000
Idle?

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.800
I'm busy!

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.740
I attend to ten thousand matters a day!

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:18.180
That's right.

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.019
Mr. Ma's exact words were...

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.139
...that amidst your busy schedule...

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.980
...you should find time...

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.339
...to write down all your valuable experiences.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.519
The educational value for our younger generation...

00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:30.639
...would be immense.

00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:33.220
That is a very important suggestion.

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:35.879
However, although right now I...

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.180
Although...

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:38.220
...I am reluctant to leave...

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:39.019
...but...

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.399
...I really cannot...

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:42.660
...disturb your rest any longer.

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:43.800
I'll take my leave now.

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:45.220
Stay busy, old leader.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.079
Who's next?

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.699
Elder Sun, Elder Fu.

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:51.279
And Mr. Zheng.

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:52.519
They are all in that VIP building ahead.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:54.439
Are they all this hard to deal with?

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:56.139
Even harder.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.920
Therefore, I have decided...

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.319
...while my memory is still good...

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.680
...to immediately start a rescue effort to...

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:05.779
...write my memoirs.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.459
Yusheng, help me type.

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:08.959
You got it.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:11.540
When the book comes out, the byline will be...

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:13.560
Dictated by Li Jianguo.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.600
Compiled by Ji Yusheng.

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.000
You got it, no problem.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.040
Ms. Liu, do you want to write one?

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.660
Your memoirs would surely be fascinating.

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:21.379
Me?

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.279
No, I'll pass.

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:24.980
I really have nothing to write about.

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:26.439
No, you have to write!

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:27.160
You must write.

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:28.819
I want to write one too.

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:30.420
I can't write one.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.740
Look, when I was young...

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.279
...I was either pasting boxes at the neighborhood factory...

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:36.560
...or selling two-eight sauce at the grocery store.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.319
If I write it, no one will read it.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.759
Well, if you put it that way...

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:42.000
If I write a memoir...

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.980
...it would definitely be a bestseller.

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:43.959
Why?

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:45.540
There's so much juicy gossip in the arts.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.160
My daughter acts in so many plays...

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.480
...and has so many fans.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.040
Then...

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.839
Then...

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:51.019
Then I'll write one too.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.060
Write.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.680
Let's write.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.439
Professor Fan, what about you?

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:57.120
Writing memoirs is for old people.

00:05:57.579 --> 00:05:59.459
For a comrade like me who has just passed middle age...

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.439
...writing this is probably premature, isn't it?

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.420
Are you throwing up?

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:07.139
I resolutely resigned and plunged into business...

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.879
Why aren't you writing?

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.980
I'm thinking about this title.

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.259
Isn't it a bit too grand?

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:19.600
*Jianguo's Memoirs*.

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:21.220
Me.

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.000
Li Jianguo.

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:24.980
My memoirs.

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:25.399
Right.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.500
Nothing wrong with that.

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.079
Okay.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.459
Where was I?

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.959
Uh...

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:31.939
Going into business.

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:34.300
In the beginning,

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.879
Jia Zhixin, President Jia, and I...

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.279
just the two of us.

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:39.759
We started by flipping wire rods.

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:40.420
Wait.

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:42.579
What does "wire rod" mean?

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.560
Is it a Beijing snack?

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.379
Can you stop thinking about food?

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:47.019
Lead wire.

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:48.279
Wire rod.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.519
Rebar.

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:51.019
Those were all...

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:52.720
scarce building materials back then.

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:56.779
Thanks to our joint efforts,

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.279
very quickly,

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:00.620
our company began to take shape.

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:02.600
It became...

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.120
a major enterprise with six people.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.920
What are you laughing at?

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.339
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, get it?

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:13.160
So I led President Jia...

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:15.180
We worked our hearts out,

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:17.019
we cut through thorns,

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.519
we moved mountains...

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:19.660
Enough with the idioms.

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:21.560
So,

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.600
how did this President Jia later...

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.860
become the Chairman?

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:26.300
And you became number two?

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:29.379
Me?

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:31.399
Isn't that just because I'm too decent?

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:33.339
But what about Old Jia?

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:34.920
Before he stepped down,

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.560
he took his son-in-law...

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.720
put him in the top spot,

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.920
and kicked me down.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.759
Think about it.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.759
Without me, Li Jianguo,

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:47.120
would the Jia family be where they are today?

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:48.639
Grandpa Li,

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:49.519
come on.

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:51.220
My condolences.

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:52.279
No,

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:53.279
calm down.

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:54.819
How about...

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:56.399
we continue writing another day?

00:07:56.579 --> 00:07:57.060
No.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.220
Continue.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.600
In 1997

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.920
That was a spring

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.199
The dazzling superstar of the Chinese world

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:11.459
Rose from my hands

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.139
Diva Bai Jingjing's Biological Father: Past Middle Age

00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:16.699
100 Amazing Stories That Must Be Told

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.079
This title is great

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:23.139
Then let's start with me and this Bai Fengqin

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:24.220
Start writing from there

00:08:24.259 --> 00:08:24.680
Okay

00:08:24.899 --> 00:08:25.439
This...

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:26.920
No

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.560
Mentioning my ex-wife

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.759
I get so furious

00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:31.779
I'm out of quick-acting heart pills too

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:32.120
No

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:32.960
Skip this chapter

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.559
Okay

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.860
Write directly about Bai Jingjing's childhood

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:36.340
Sure

00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:39.059
Starting from when Bai Jingjing went to primary school

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:40.440
Her grades were excellent

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:42.019
Wait a moment

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.639
How did we jump to primary school?

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:45.779
Shouldn't we start from that...

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.840
Write from infancy?

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.460
Infancy...

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:52.419
I was quite busy back then

00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:53.440
Didn't participate much

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:54.679
I'll make something up later

00:08:54.899 --> 00:08:56.440
No, I mean, I'll recall it later

00:08:56.659 --> 00:08:57.740
Just start from primary school

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.279
Okay

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.080
So she...

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.639
Which primary school did she attend?

00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:03.539
Which primary school...

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.879
Is this important?

00:09:05.019 --> 00:09:06.059
It is important

00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:07.279
It has to be written down

00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:10.320
That shows you have exclusive info

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.980
This exclusive info about primary school...

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.139
I...

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:15.620
I don't exactly have a grip on it

00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:18.580
You call and ask

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:19.779
Right

00:09:29.379 --> 00:09:29.980
You take it

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:30.500
Okay

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.440
Hello

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.799
Ms. Bai is filming

00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:35.700
Who is this?

00:09:36.799 --> 00:09:37.980
Uncle Liang

00:09:38.539 --> 00:09:40.039
Hello

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.659
Yes, Sister Jingjing is filming

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.500
Yes, in Beijing

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.740
Not far from your retirement community

00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:51.759
Sister Jingjing wants you to come visit the set

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:53.620
Good

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.840
She wants you there as soon as possible

00:09:58.299 --> 00:09:59.740
Who told you to tell him that?

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.940
And "as soon as possible"?

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.100
Isn't this causing me trouble?

00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:04.000
I thought you...

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.960
Are you stupid?

00:10:05.019 --> 00:10:05.799
If he comes

00:10:05.799 --> 00:10:07.240
What if he runs into my mom?

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:18.519
Then this memoir of Dad's will

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:19.220
temporarily

00:10:19.779 --> 00:10:20.600
be put on hold

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.279
Just don't write it

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.720
You don't even know where I went to elementary school

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.279
You're just making things up here

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:28.500
Aren't you just attracting haters for me

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:30.960
Dad is doing this because

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.179
I missed out on that part of your growing up

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:34.480
so I want to

00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:35.399
make up for it

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:36.940
Enough

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.860
Do you have anything else

00:10:38.919 --> 00:10:40.720
If not, I'm going to study my lines

00:10:41.379 --> 00:10:42.059
No

00:10:42.059 --> 00:10:43.039
Look

00:10:43.779 --> 00:10:45.779
Dad will just sit here and keep you company for a while

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:48.840
Dad can do anything for you

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.980
How about Dad becomes your assistant

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.639
That way I can take care of you every day

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.120
Do you know how to be an assistant

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:58.840
Well

00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:00.580
Being an assistant is too simple

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:02.639
Isn't it just carrying bags, grabbing chairs, holding umbrellas

00:11:03.139 --> 00:11:04.399
Serving tea, pouring water, and cooking

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:05.899
Massaging the boss's shoulders when free

00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:08.399
Then what am I supposed to do

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.580
You may look ugly

00:11:11.299 --> 00:11:12.980
but you sure dream big

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.000
Bai Fengqin

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.379
No

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.539
Why is she here

00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:18.500
The daughter I raised with so much hardship

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.740
Why shouldn't I come

00:11:20.779 --> 00:11:22.539
As for you, Liang

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:23.440
Please

00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:25.240
stay away

00:11:25.539 --> 00:11:26.340
from my daughter

00:11:27.039 --> 00:11:27.980
Who is this

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:28.659
You two

00:11:28.659 --> 00:11:31.259
Stop filming

00:11:31.419 --> 00:11:32.299
Stop filming

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:33.779
Change

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.440
"with the assistance of comrades"

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.440
to

00:11:38.139 --> 00:11:39.200
"all by myself"

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.340
"single-handedly"

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.799
"All by myself, single-handedly"

00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:42.639
Right, good

00:11:42.879 --> 00:11:44.080
Still writing

00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:46.519
Can't you spare the kid

00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:47.820
Then you type for me

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.019
Let me take a look first

00:11:49.639 --> 00:11:50.840
How's the writing going

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.179
Old Li

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.500
Listen to this paragraph

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.059
It was May Day, 1980

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:03.480
My fiancée and I went on our first date

00:12:05.539 --> 00:12:08.100
We watched the movie *Shaolin Temple*

00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:11.259
It was truly an unforgettable night

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.179
How is it

00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:13.899
Jealous, aren't you

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.179
Fed you a mouthful of dog food

00:12:16.299 --> 00:12:17.759
Pah, you're the dog

00:12:17.919 --> 00:12:18.740
Dog brain

00:12:19.059 --> 00:12:19.820
*Shaolin Temple*

00:12:19.879 --> 00:12:20.899
What year was it released

00:12:21.179 --> 00:12:21.840
1980

00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:22.379
Wrong

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.399
It was '82, okay

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:25.720
Right

00:12:25.899 --> 00:12:26.679
Look it up

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:27.879
I checked

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.320
*Shaolin Temple* really was released in 1982

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.379
See

00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:33.919
Listen to this part of yours again

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:38.500
The poem she loved

00:12:38.659 --> 00:12:40.120
I wrote in the love letter

00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:43.879
The most memorable was Xu Zhimo's *Fragment*

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.419
You

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.419
stand on the bridge viewing the scenery

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.840
Never heard of this poem

00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:52.580
Classy, right

00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:54.200
Who hasn't heard of it

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.120
Check it

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.240
Who is the author

00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.799
The author isn't Xu Zhimo

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:01.200
It's Bian Zhilin

00:13:02.139 --> 00:13:03.220
So much for "classy"

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.559
Again

00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:07.480
Listen to this part again

00:13:08.419 --> 00:13:10.440
After the Spring Festival of 1992,

00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:13.639
Mr. Jia and I flew to Shenzhen for the first time.

00:13:14.039 --> 00:13:16.700
The free Maotai served on the plane...

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.379
Mr. Jia got dead drunk.

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:20.440
That's right.

00:13:21.039 --> 00:13:22.779
I remember this very clearly.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.480
Maotai.

00:13:23.679 --> 00:13:24.440
It was definitely Maotai.

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:25.259
Can't be wrong.

00:13:25.539 --> 00:13:26.679
Actually, it is wrong.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.240
Free Maotai on planes...

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.179
that part is true.

00:13:30.379 --> 00:13:31.639
But in the late 80s,

00:13:31.759 --> 00:13:32.519
it was discontinued.

00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:35.100
Look it up.

00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:38.200
Hey, don't you have anything better to do?

00:13:38.879 --> 00:13:40.039
Why are you causing trouble here?

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:41.259
Get out.

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.480
Me, get out?

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:45.740
This is my room too.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.960
Where am I supposed to go?

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:48.220
Stop filming.

00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:50.120
I said stop filming.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.500
Do I have to turn off the phone?

00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:54.820
Look at you.

00:13:55.179 --> 00:13:57.679
You're causing so much trouble for Jingjing.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.480
Couldn't you just stay in that nursing home?

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.139
Why did you run over here?

00:14:02.539 --> 00:14:03.980
You've been scolding me for ages now.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.480
I'm going easy on you in front of our daughter.

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:07.740
Don't go on and on.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.860
How am I going on and on?

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.840
Can you two stop arguing?

00:14:11.139 --> 00:14:12.340
You fight as soon as you meet.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.740
Isn't it annoying?

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:16.480
Fine.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.299
Old Bai.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.740
Ma'am.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.980
Can we sit down calmly?

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.720
You *are* sitting.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:26.820
And have a talk.

00:14:28.139 --> 00:14:29.960
You were just like this back in the day.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.779
Nothing was ever good enough for you.

00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:34.419
Pulling a long face all day.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.259
Like everyone on the street owed you money.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.860
Nonsense. Slander.

00:14:38.559 --> 00:14:39.639
When was I ever like that?

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.159
Actually,

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:42.080
Mom,

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.600
you really were a bit like that.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.879
Our daughter said so, I'm right, aren't I?

00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:47.379
Actually, back then,

00:14:47.379 --> 00:14:49.080
I put up with you for so long.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.639
I really didn't want to divorce you.

00:14:50.799 --> 00:14:51.720
Wasn't it just because back then,

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.879
you wouldn't let go of that one little thing?

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.820
No matter how I apologized or promised, it wasn't enough.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.840
You insisted on divorcing me.

00:14:58.019 --> 00:14:59.179
You apologized?

00:14:59.259 --> 00:15:00.200
Admitted your mistake?

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.419
Was your apology or promise worth anything?

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.620
You were possessed back then.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.080
You were completely deluded.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.159
You were dead set

00:15:07.159 --> 00:15:08.759
on leaving with that little vixen.

00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:10.820
You dumped us, mother and daughter, just like that.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.039
You're making it up, nonsense.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Am I that kind of person?

00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:15.700
Actually,

00:15:15.799 --> 00:15:16.279
Dad,

00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:18.220
you are exactly that kind of person.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.139
See?

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:21.720
Even our daughter knows about it.

00:15:21.779 --> 00:15:22.299
Right?

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.379
And you still won't admit it.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.379
Go on then.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.019
Go live with that little vixen.

00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:28.179
Why come back to find us?

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.200
Well, in the end,

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.360
I didn't marry her.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.700
Aren't I still single now?

00:15:35.299 --> 00:15:36.480
That's because

00:15:36.559 --> 00:15:38.000
you left with absolutely nothing.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
She despised you and wouldn't be with you.

00:15:40.259 --> 00:15:41.320
That's not true.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.100
Can you two stop arguing?

00:15:45.679 --> 00:15:46.740
All these years,

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:48.559
how many times have I dreamt

00:15:48.559 --> 00:15:50.419
of our family reuniting?

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.360
I even fantasized you two might get back together.

00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:54.320
But looking at it now,

00:15:54.759 --> 00:15:55.940
forget it.

00:15:56.299 --> 00:15:57.659
You fight the moment you meet.

00:15:57.659 --> 00:15:58.799
You smash things at the drop of a hat.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.460
I remember it all now.

00:16:01.659 --> 00:16:03.960
I beg you, don't meet each other anymore.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.360
I really can't handle the embarrassment.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.019
How about...

00:16:16.179 --> 00:16:16.759
Old Bai,

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:18.480
we just

00:16:19.039 --> 00:16:20.259
shake hands and make peace?

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:21.759
That's good.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.820
Why don't you two just get back together?

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.960
It's great for Sister Jing's image.

00:16:26.019 --> 00:16:27.440
Trending for at least five days.

00:16:32.539 --> 00:16:34.299
That's not completely out of the question

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:36.960
I'm mainly thinking about

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.240
My daughter's career

00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:40.480
What are you saying?

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.440
Your daughter?

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.340
That is *my* daughter

00:16:44.419 --> 00:16:46.659
Bai Jingjing's surname is Bai

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.240
Think about it carefully

00:16:48.259 --> 00:16:49.799
Did you care for her growing up?

00:16:49.799 --> 00:16:51.080
What did you ever do for her?

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.759
Did you take her to the park?

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.480
Or attend her parent-teacher meetings?

00:16:54.559 --> 00:16:56.639
Or take her to the children's hospital for shots?

00:16:56.659 --> 00:16:59.259
Or go with her to tutoring classes?

00:16:59.539 --> 00:17:01.899
It was me who endured the hardships

00:17:01.899 --> 00:17:03.779
To raise my daughter into an adult

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.359
And make her a big star

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:05.680
You...

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.500
Now you show up

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.059
You just want to reap the benefits, don't you?

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.440
Let me tell you, Liang

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.900
You get out of here right now

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.779
Don't let me see you again

00:17:13.559 --> 00:17:14.180
Look at you

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.700
You turn on people just like that

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.759
You haven't changed a bit in all these years

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:18.240
I...

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.940
I remember it all now too

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.240
I was right to leave you back then

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.880
I'm going

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.200
If I ever come looking for you again...

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.240
I wasn't looking for you this time anyway

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.720
Didn't I say stop filming?

00:17:30.779 --> 00:17:31.500
Delete it all

00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:33.319
Or we'll take up the weapon of the law

00:17:34.099 --> 00:17:35.299
Everyone knows

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.839
If you don't believe me, let's ask Ms. Liu

00:17:37.359 --> 00:17:37.980
Ms. Liu

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.559
There's a modern poem called *Fragment*

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:41.960
Who is the author?

00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:44.420
It's Bian Zhilin, right?

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.160
See?

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.440
Bian Zhilin

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.400
I knew that

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:48.680
Right?

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.920
The Hong Kong TV star

00:17:50.299 --> 00:17:52.140
You're talking about Guan Zhilin

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.240
Mr. Li

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.460
The first draft of your memoirs

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.319
I've typed it out for you

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.619
Here, take a look

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.380
Hurry, read it out

00:17:59.380 --> 00:17:59.920
Read it

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
I just love listening to stories

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.599
Love listening to stories

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.400
Alright

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.400
I'll read you a section

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.539
Pick an exciting part

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:10.980
How about this part

00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:14.799
The year 1997

00:18:15.059 --> 00:18:16.559
Was a glorious year

00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:19.220
At the time, with great foresight

00:18:19.279 --> 00:18:20.500
I overcame all dissenting opinions

00:18:20.579 --> 00:18:22.559
Financial investment, planning approval

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.940
I ran my legs off

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.299
I wore out my lips talking

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:27.680
Finally, in the place where I once fought

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.519
A Sanjiang Bridge rose from the ground

00:18:30.579 --> 00:18:32.880
It was truly a bridge flying north and south

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.819
Turning a deep chasm into a thoroughfare

00:18:35.319 --> 00:18:36.339
Keep blowing

00:18:36.339 --> 00:18:37.519
You're blowing it out of proportion

00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:40.559
I'm not blowing, this is real

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.319
Mr. Li

00:18:41.859 --> 00:18:43.220
When we write an autobiography

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.819
We must seek truth from facts

00:18:44.819 --> 00:18:45.640
It is not suitable

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.140
To exaggerate too much

00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:49.240
I didn't exaggerate

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.119
Not exaggeration

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.079
It's pure fabrication

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.059
I...

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.680
I have a witness

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.140
The Chief Engineer back then, Hu Yuguang

00:18:57.299 --> 00:18:58.339
Was my old subordinate

00:18:58.539 --> 00:18:59.299
A good partner

00:18:59.539 --> 00:19:00.880
He can testify for me

00:19:01.539 --> 00:19:02.579
A bear harvesting corn

00:19:02.579 --> 00:19:03.279
Pure nonsense

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:06.579
You don't believe me, right?

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:10.579
Tomorrow I'll go find Chief Engineer Hu

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.079
And verify

00:19:12.079 --> 00:19:13.619
Some of the technical details from back then

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:14.779
Yusheng

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.400
Come with me tomorrow

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.460
Be my witness

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.039
Use facts

00:19:20.279 --> 00:19:21.640
To strike back at his

00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:23.440
Cynical mockery

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:35.759
Come in.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.019
Xiao Hu.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.440
Long time no see.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.380
Who is this?

00:19:46.839 --> 00:19:48.259
Mr. Know-It-All.

00:19:49.339 --> 00:19:49.920
President Li.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:50.640
President Li.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.740
Don't call me President Li.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.539
I'm retired.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.240
Xiao Hu.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:58.880
No.

00:19:59.359 --> 00:20:00.200
Old Hu.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:01.819
President Hu.

00:20:03.299 --> 00:20:04.299
How have you been lately?

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.400
Doing great.

00:20:06.579 --> 00:20:08.160
Not working with you anymore,

00:20:08.259 --> 00:20:09.220
how could I not be?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:11.940
Uncle.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.900
How can you say that?

00:20:14.359 --> 00:20:15.539
That's just too...

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.839
rude, isn't it?

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:18.599
Handsome.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.200
If you knew how we used to

00:20:21.839 --> 00:20:22.900
work together back then,

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.880
you wouldn't say that.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:26.680
I do know.

00:20:27.539 --> 00:20:28.720
Back in '97,

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.759
it was you and President Li

00:20:29.759 --> 00:20:31.259
who built the Sanjiang Bridge together.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:32.900
At the time, President Li

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:33.940
showed great foresight,

00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:35.160
overruled all objections,

00:20:35.259 --> 00:20:37.160
and fully supported your design and construction.

00:20:37.539 --> 00:20:38.680
You two...

00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:40.700
weren't you great partners at work?

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.140
Is that how you tricked him?

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.259
Yeah, that's how I tricked...

00:20:43.539 --> 00:20:44.680
No, how is that a trick?

00:20:45.279 --> 00:20:46.839
It's the honest truth!

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.119
How come you don't remember?

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.180
How can I remember something that never happened?

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.380
Back then, you were clearly giving blind orders.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.779
An amateur leading the expert.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.019
Why do you think I changed jobs later?

00:20:57.579 --> 00:20:59.099
Why did I come to this company?

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.500
It's all his fault.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.319
How is it my fault?

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.000
That project back then,

00:21:05.339 --> 00:21:06.480
we were on the same team.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.039
That part is true.

00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:07.839
See? Right?

00:21:08.839 --> 00:21:09.799
But... however...

00:21:11.539 --> 00:21:12.880
I said right from the start,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.500
the geological conditions there

00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:15.880
weren't suitable for building a bridge.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.700
Did I say that or not?

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.640
Seems like that happened.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.859
But that project of ours

00:21:22.859 --> 00:21:24.660
was to benefit the local people!

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.160
Give me a break.

00:21:26.299 --> 00:21:27.279
Actually, he...

00:21:27.279 --> 00:21:29.160
just wanted to show off

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.480
in front of the locals.

00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:33.279
Actually, the geological conditions 10km away

00:21:33.319 --> 00:21:34.619
were much better for a bridge.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.940
And the people in that county

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.019
really needed that bridge too.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.339
So what?

00:21:42.339 --> 00:21:43.480
I was a senior executive.

00:21:43.519 --> 00:21:45.160
I fully listened to

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.799
opinions from all sides

00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:48.559
before resolutely making the final call

00:21:48.619 --> 00:21:49.839
to build the bridge at the original site.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.579
Great foresight,

00:21:50.579 --> 00:21:51.519
overruling objections, right?

00:21:53.539 --> 00:21:55.299
It's true you were an executive.

00:21:55.819 --> 00:21:56.640
But you can't just

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.180
meddle in everything blindly.

00:21:58.539 --> 00:21:59.299
Do you know

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.240
what we call him in private?

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.599
Mr. Know-It-All.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:04.740
Fine.

00:22:05.019 --> 00:22:05.640
Enough.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.339
Stop spreading that around.

00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:11.420
Every place has a few backward folks.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.160
Right?

00:22:12.839 --> 00:22:13.859
Let's get back to work.

00:22:14.819 --> 00:22:16.240
After that project was built,

00:22:16.799 --> 00:22:18.400
didn't it benefit the locals?

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.519
The company also made a profit.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.700
Half the credit goes to you.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.579
Shouldn't half of it be mine too?

00:22:25.859 --> 00:22:27.319
I had no part in a lot of it.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.180
Let me ask you.

00:22:29.839 --> 00:22:32.299
That construction team for the bridge contract...

00:22:32.599 --> 00:22:33.660
...you decided on them, right?

00:22:33.839 --> 00:22:35.240
That foreman, Liu Big Head...

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.400
...is an acquaintance of yours, right?

00:22:37.279 --> 00:22:38.900
No, his grandfather and I were close.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.059
I introduced him.

00:22:40.339 --> 00:22:40.960
But...

00:22:41.799 --> 00:22:43.019
...his construction team...

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.240
...was seriously underqualified.

00:22:45.559 --> 00:22:46.119
Also...

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.460
...the project budget...

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.140
...you had the final say, right?

00:22:49.299 --> 00:22:49.859
Of course.

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:51.700
I'm the head of the company.

00:22:53.359 --> 00:22:54.619
My original design...

00:22:54.839 --> 00:22:56.099
...was sturdy and durable.

00:22:56.099 --> 00:22:57.200
And cost-effective.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.400
But him?

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.980
He just had to meddle in it.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.799
Nitpicking everything.

00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:04.019
The bridge was nearly half built...

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.099
...and he insisted on tearing it down and starting over.

00:23:06.359 --> 00:23:07.059
And what happened in the end?

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.559
The budget ran out.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.420
We had to cut corners.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.500
Finally...

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.680
...it became a tofu-dreg project.

00:23:15.839 --> 00:23:16.700
Grandpa Li...

00:23:17.339 --> 00:23:18.619
...is this true?

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:22.140
Why is this completely different...

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.000
...from what I remember?

00:23:25.359 --> 00:23:26.019
Handsome...

00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:28.160
...do you still think...

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.539
...I'm being rude to him?

00:23:32.359 --> 00:23:33.980
How could it be like this?

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.259
But regardless...

00:23:36.579 --> 00:23:38.440
...from a young novice...

00:23:39.099 --> 00:23:40.279
...if not for me...

00:23:40.839 --> 00:23:41.940
...if not for this project...

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.900
...would you have been fast-tracked to Chief Engineer?

00:23:45.519 --> 00:23:47.480
You should at least thank me for that.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:48.299
Yes.

00:23:49.599 --> 00:23:51.319
I'm especially grateful to you.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.440
The year before last...

00:23:54.539 --> 00:23:56.740
...it rained for days, and flash floods hit.

00:23:56.819 --> 00:23:57.680
That bridge...

00:23:59.160 --> 00:23:59.980
...collapsed.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:01.960
Collapsed.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.279
Luckily, there were no casualties.

00:24:06.099 --> 00:24:07.119
Later, when they investigated...

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.119
...who designed this bridge?

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:10.400
Well, there it is.

00:24:11.599 --> 00:24:12.480
So...

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.640
...I changed jobs...

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.299
...and came here to do administration.

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:18.779
I'm especially grateful for that bridge.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.799
Thank you, Mr. Li.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.059
For giving me this black mark on my record.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.000
How could it be like this?

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.000
Seems memory is quite unreliable.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:36.720
Mr. Hu...

00:24:37.319 --> 00:24:39.259
...I completely understand you now.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.819
I just hope when I start working...

00:24:44.099 --> 00:24:44.579
...I don't run into...

00:24:44.579 --> 00:24:46.920
...a boss like Grandpa Li.

00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:48.400
Why are you like this?

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.000
Whose side are you on?

00:24:50.279 --> 00:24:50.799
I...

00:24:53.099 --> 00:24:54.059
He has a point.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:24:59.839
What happened next?

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:01.920
Brother Liang.

00:25:02.039 --> 00:25:03.779
You're not writing your memoirs anymore?

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:05.119
Not anymore.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.099
Professor Fan is right about this.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.240
We are still young.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.079
No rush to write memoirs.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.000
Grandpa Li.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.000
Are you getting rid of all these drafts?

00:25:15.539 --> 00:25:16.400
Shred them all.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.240
Don't leave a single word.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.599
So *Jianguo's Memoirs* is halted too?

00:25:22.339 --> 00:25:23.500
Through this recollection,

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.319
I realized many past events

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.259
don't match my memory,

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.160
or are even the exact opposite.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.700
Many were just things I imagined.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.619
So,

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.180
I decided not to write it.

00:25:35.299 --> 00:25:36.599
Scrap it and start over.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:38.839
Seek truth from facts.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:39.619
Verify carefully.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.460
Even the embarrassing stuff,

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.400
I will write it all down.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.039
To warn future generations.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:44.880
Yes.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:45.420
Good.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.019
Right?

00:25:47.059 --> 00:25:49.119
Professor Fan, what are you strolling around for?

00:25:49.599 --> 00:25:50.559
Writing my memoirs.

00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:52.059
I need to trace back some details.

00:25:52.059 --> 00:25:53.259
I came out to clear my head.

00:25:53.779 --> 00:25:54.180
You...

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.579
Didn't you say you weren't in a rush to write them?

00:25:56.779 --> 00:25:58.079
I thought about it again.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.980
My precious life experiences

00:26:01.339 --> 00:26:03.339
should be salvaged and excavated.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:04.420
Left for the future

00:26:04.539 --> 00:26:05.500
generations of students.

00:26:05.599 --> 00:26:07.059
I expect it will cause

00:26:07.319 --> 00:26:08.779
quite a sensation in the academic world.

00:26:09.519 --> 00:26:10.759
This guy is bragging again.

00:26:10.759 --> 00:26:11.319
Tell me,

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.559
why is he like this?

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.940
Probably caught it from you.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:14.420
Right.

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:15.480
Who?

00:26:15.839 --> 00:26:16.519
Everyone,

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:17.940
my memoirs

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.079
will start from the resumption of the entrance exams.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.099
That was the turning point of my life.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.279
The fighting year of 1977.

00:26:24.319 --> 00:26:25.880
I stepped onto the university campus.

00:26:26.099 --> 00:26:26.680
Hold on.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.039
Which year did you say?

00:26:29.359 --> 00:26:30.579
1977.

00:26:30.759 --> 00:26:31.720
I'm Class of '77.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.619
The first batch.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.180
Wrong.

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:36.160
You students of the Class of '77

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.720
passed the exam in '77,

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.740
but entered campus in '78.

00:26:41.119 --> 00:26:42.319
How is that possible?

00:26:42.539 --> 00:26:43.680
Don't mess with my train of thought.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.920
I have to go continue writing.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.680
1978.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.160
Must stick to the facts.

00:26:47.799 --> 00:26:48.579
1978.

00:26:49.259 --> 00:26:50.720
Another Muddlehead.
