WEBVTT

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.839
We can grow two seasons of grain a year in Hainan

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.119
But mostly we grow tropical fruit trees

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.640
It's basically traditional farming

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:37.159
The level of mechanization isn't high

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.200
Because of the tropical climate

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:40.280
There's a lot of rainfall

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.920
So preventing mold and rot is also quite important

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.600
What did I do to deserve this?

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.039
Why does the department have to go to Hainan?

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:49.520
To work on experimental planting fields?

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.520
Can I not go?

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.640
I don't want to go back to Hainan

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.159
I want to go on a vacation

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:53.640
Xiaoyin

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.399
Darn it

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:02.399
Xiaoyin, for this field trip, I'd like to

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.719
assign you to lead the team

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.000
See if that works for you

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.200
It works

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.040
That's great

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.400
I feel much more at ease with you there

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.519
Thank you, Xiaoyin

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.040
The trees for this experimental planting

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.200
have already been planted at the base

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:19.319
and professionals are responsible for their cultivation

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.280
As for the new tree species

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.840
mainly in terms of pest control

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.280
some upgrades and modifications were made

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:25.959
so we need to collect a large amount of field data

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:28.799
Professor, so for the data collection this time

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.000
will we use the lab's latest equipment

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.400
to go "Dudu"?

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.519
We won't be going "Dudu" this time

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.439
The main task for undergraduate students this time

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.439
is counting bugs

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:44.760
Guifang, I'm scared of bugs

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.359
I can't do it, bugs are what I fear most

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:47.799
I really don't want to go count bugs

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:49.640
However

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.879
is the holiday internship linked to the postgraduate recommendation?

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.359
The number of bugs is one data point

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:00.680
Of course, there are other data to record

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.280
This is a very rare opportunity for practice

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.519
Although it's very hard work

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.599
and quite boring

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.799
I still hope

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.800
students will sign up enthusiastically

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:09.840
I'll sign up

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.000
Good

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.439
Guifang, you're the best

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:14.639
You're going to keep me company, right?

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.120
Professor Wang

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.840
Do we have that insect atlas?

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.800
So how should we classify these bugs?

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.680
Besides counting, do we have to kill them?

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:23.479
What date are we leaving?

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.000
I'll answer you later

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:29.520
I've left the sign-up sheet with team leader Chen Xiaoyin

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.120
Students who want to go can sign up with her

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.520
You don't need to rush

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.879
Think it over for the next couple of days

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:34.560
Consider it carefully

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.639
Class dismissed

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.120
As expected of Kong Guifang, who took the college by storm

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.000
Thanks to her

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.599
I'm still carrying a disciplinary record

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:48.680
Suddenly I don't know if I should be afraid of Guifang

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.000
or afraid of the bugs

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.719
Does anyone else want to sign up?

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.919
Xiaocan

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:25.960
Come with us to Hainan later

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:33.840
Why wear a hat and sunglasses at home?

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:01.680
So your mom became like this

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.520
all because of you, right?

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.120
You... listen to me.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.759
I heard everything.

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:05.599
What else is there to say?

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.120
You've instantly turned into a boiled egg.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.120
And you're still making things up.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.479
It's... it's a bit complicated.

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:12.719
So you're dying, aren't you?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.680
It's possible, but...

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.839
Was that an alien just now?

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.600
Yes.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:19.480
Call him back.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.519
I'm telling you, the consequences are serious.

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:24.079
It's you, isn't it?

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:26.360
You made him like this, right?

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.199
Change him back right now.

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.120
It's my job.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.120
What kind of bullshit job is that?

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.480
Does a job give you the right to disregard life?

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:32.439
Are you even human?

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:33.680
Well, I'm not human to begin with.

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:34.639
Change him back immediately.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.480
Hurry up!

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:37.199
Xu... Xu Rui.

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.319
Don't... don't be rash. Um...

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.920
Where is he?

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.120
He has a teleportation power.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.279
I can't control him either.

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.279
But you were right to scold him just now.

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.160
And you, Kong Xiaocan.

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:47.519
You think treating your life like a joke

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:48.360
makes you noble, huh?

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:50.000
No, call him back right now. Quick!

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:51.839
No, it's useless if I call him.

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:53.000
He's never listened to me.

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:54.439
She knows too much.

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:55.000
I must...

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.639
You...

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:59.879
See? I told you you can't catch him.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.519
Kong Xiaocan!

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.360
Don't ask me again.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.399
I really can't catch him.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.160
I'll erase her memory.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.399
Quick!

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.240
You run pretty fast.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.360
Yeah.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.120
This time, it's this way.

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:26.319
Xu Rui, actually, about this...

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.079
I did it willingly.

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:30.160
I did make a trade to save my mom's life.

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:31.879
Although the price is high...

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:33.199
but look at my mom now.

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:34.279
She really is...

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.519
Run! My hair, my hair!

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.639
Keep running!

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:41.519
I won't run, I won't run! You're pretty fast.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.199
Change him back right now. Quick!

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.720
I can't change him back.

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:47.399
Because I made a deal with him.

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:48.639
If you keep interfering...

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.160
things will get even more chaotic.

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:50.839
What do you mean?

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.040
It means that...

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.040
an outsider like you who hasn't made a deal...

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.240
could put him in even greater danger.

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:00.399
Yes, that's right.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.639
Then I'll make the trade.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.480
Rui, don't be impulsive.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.680
He's a profiteer.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.879
Don't worry.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.120
I know what I'm doing.

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:24.399
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.319
Based on your life experience,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.720
here is a customized deal for you.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.519
Please take a look.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.560
Simple.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.839
Clear.

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:31.800
Efficient.

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:33.560
Here is another one.

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:36.560
But having said that,

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:39.399
I usually customize requests for clients.

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:42.600
I didn't expect someone to seek me out for a deal.

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:43.959
This is a first.

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:45.800
Come, let me introduce this to you.

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:47.199
Like this one.

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:50.240
This is the Permanent Dark Circle Removal Package.

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:53.399
No matter how late you stay up, no dark circles.

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:55.639
Giving you back beautiful big eyes.

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:57.720
It only costs eight years of lifespan now.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.920
What exactly is this life energy?

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:04.319
Why do you want it?

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:07.480
What is life energy?

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:08.839
Good question.

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:11.279
Life energy is like gasoline.

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:13.959
A car only runs when you add gas.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.759
Only then can it drive normally.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.160
The difference is,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.160
you lifeforms on Earth

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.000
can replenish energy through photosynthesis

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.720
or by eating food.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.399
But we cannot.

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:34.959
We can only

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:37.639
extract a portion of energy from you.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.120
Just like this.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.879
However, it's hard for you to get energy too.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.519
So,

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.399
we provide some benefits

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:53.160
as compensation.

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:54.680
Like curing diseases, becoming beautiful or handsome,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.839
changing your appearance, and so on.

00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:58.560
Isn't that just robbery?

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:00.439
It's not robbery.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.560
We can't just extract energy whenever we want.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.680
You have to go through complex approval processes.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.160
Uploading, approving...

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.120
Approval? Who approves it?

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:08.959
The company supervisors.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.120
We also follow rules and procedures.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.519
The word "company,"

00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:14.040
we actually learned it from you humans.

00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:14.959
Very efficient.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.759
Let me introduce another one.

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:18.720
The Eat-Without-Gaining-Weight Package.

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:20.279
You won't gain weight no matter how much you eat.

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:21.680
It only costs twenty years of lifespan.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.680
Twenty years?

00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:26.680
Do you know the average human lifespan?

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.480
You ask for twenty years right off the bat?

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.160
Are you crazy?

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.040
There are cheaper ones.

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:31.279
Curing your ankle is very cheap.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.159
Only six years.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:34.799
Restore Xiaocan and Auntie Kong to normal.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.480
Cancel the deal. How many years?

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:39.480
Dear, I'm afraid that's not possible.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.399
Putting aside that we have no return or refund policy,

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:43.320
even if we did,

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:44.639
she has cancer.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.679
To cure her completely

00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:47.840
and let her live a healthy life,

00:08:48.039 --> 00:08:50.240
might require hundreds of years of life energy.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.600
Humans cannot afford this price.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.759
Won't you really consider these plans?

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:58.960
I'm not interested.

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:01.200
Give me time to think it over.

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:02.440
I'll tell you when I've decided.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.080
Do you have a phone number?

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.080
No.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.600
How can I contact you without a phone?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.759
Don't tell me you'll come if I snap my fingers?

00:09:10.039 --> 00:09:10.360
Yes.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.200
As long as you snap your fingers,

00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:14.360
I'll be there anytime.

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:17.600
Do you want to look again?

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:18.879
Leave now.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.600
Looking forward to our next collaboration.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.120
You made up your mind so fast?

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.120
I'll just give it a try.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:41.759
Then next time...

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.120
Say,

00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:51.360
when we get to Hainan,

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.000
will we have unlimited fruit?

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.440
Not really.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.679
Even apples are rare in Hainan.

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.480
It's mostly mangoes and coconuts.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.360
You'll get sick of them in two days.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.039
Xiaoyin, look.

00:10:00.799 --> 00:10:01.480
Which one looks better?

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:05.000
They both look good. Take them both.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.679
I think so too.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:06.919
I think these two...

00:10:06.919 --> 00:10:08.320
go really well with the sea.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.279
But, the color of the sea...

00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:12.559
mainly depends on the weather at the time.

00:10:12.799 --> 00:10:13.639
I checked the weather forecast.

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:15.480
It says it might rain the two days we're there.

00:10:15.639 --> 00:10:16.559
Rain is great!

00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:17.279
If it rains,

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.279
our saplings can drink their fill.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.279
Fang'er, why do you like Hainan so much?

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:24.879
Don't you like your hometown?

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:27.600
Forget it.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.120
Professor Wang asked me to book tickets.

00:10:30.519 --> 00:10:31.320
I was thinking,

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.639
we students should save the school some money.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.320
So I'll book hard sleepers on the train.

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:37.600
It's 944 per person for a round trip.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.159
I'm going to book it. Hanging up now.

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:39.960
Wait a minute.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.000
Can we bring a few people at their own expense?

00:10:43.679 --> 00:10:45.679
I want to invite Xiaocan and the others.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.000
Just treat it as a vacation.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.240
Then when there's nothing to do,

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.799
they can help us count bugs.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.879
Sure, let them come.

00:10:51.879 --> 00:10:52.679
We can hang out together.

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:54.000
Actually,

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.480
otherwise I'd be farming every day,

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.600
and having to face my mom.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.759
You don't need to worry about accommodation.

00:10:58.759 --> 00:10:59.799
Stay at my place. My house is big.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.279
Then I won't be polite.

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:01.799
No problem, no problem.

00:11:01.799 --> 00:11:03.159
Send me the ticket information.

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:04.399
I'll have Xiaocan and the others book the same one.

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:05.519
Okay, I'll send it to you in a bit.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:06.919
Hanging up. Bye-bye.

00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:08.200
Xiaocan.

00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:11.279
Go tell Xu Rui, Li Wai, and the others,

00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:12.519
we're going to Hainan together.

00:11:12.799 --> 00:11:14.559
And don't worry about accommodation.

00:11:14.559 --> 00:11:15.720
Xiaoyin has arranged it.

00:11:19.639 --> 00:11:19.960
Okay.

00:11:27.919 --> 00:11:28.360
Look at you...

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.240
What's wrong?

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.120
I just wanted to go for this look.

00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:32.200
Isn't it cool?

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:33.919
Cool.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.200
I'm off then.

00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:36.480
Where are you going?

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:38.080
To watch Xu Rui's competition.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.919
Remember to tell Xu Rui about the Hainan trip.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:42.679
Okay.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:46.960
Finally gone.

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:48.679
Out of sight, out of mind.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:51.440
Chairman Fang.

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:55.480
About the Nanshang TV Spring Festival Gala...

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.919
we still need to trouble you.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.519
To find a small segment for our Xiao Tian.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.200
Just to show his face.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.080
Singing or dancing.

00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:05.039
Sir, I can perform a skit.

00:12:05.799 --> 00:12:07.480
And promote my hometown's potatoes.

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:09.120
The dry matter content is very high... No, no, no.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:09.639
Alright, alright.

00:12:11.879 --> 00:12:12.399
Singing works.

00:12:12.559 --> 00:12:13.840
He sings better than he speaks, right, brother?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.840
If he goes off-key...

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.840
we'll just switch to rap.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.039
Add some autotune or something.

00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:18.320
Dancing is no problem either.

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:19.960
This kid has great stamina.

00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:21.519
And my potatoes...

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.519
Okay, okay, okay.

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:24.080
No, no, stop with the potatoes.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.120
This... this kid.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:26.879
Fine.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.080
We can arrange a duet.

00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:31.759
Our company has a girl to promote right now.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.720
Later, they could co-star in a mini web series.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:35.960
Hype them up as a couple or something.

00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:37.519
That's wonderful.

00:12:37.919 --> 00:12:38.279
Brother.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.639
As his manager...

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:40.960
regarding his...

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.399
career path planning...

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.600
I'm also considering whether to...

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.679
steer him down the acting path.

00:12:45.679 --> 00:12:46.039
Right?

00:12:46.039 --> 00:12:46.639
Yes, yes, yes.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.159
Has your kid studied acting?

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.120
I've trained him.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.879
Brother, has your kid studied acting?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.799
Does acting need to be learned?

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.240
No need. Just knowing how to speak is enough.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.000
Can you speak?

00:13:03.039 --> 00:13:04.600
I... I guess so.

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:06.240
It's a deal.

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:08.000
Brother.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.039
Come on, let's us two brothers...

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.559
have a good catch-up, shall we?

00:13:16.159 --> 00:13:16.720
Brother Maizi

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.039
I need to take this call.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.000
Okay, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:23.840
Hello, Guifang.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.240
Can you talk right now?

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.120
Yes, go ahead.

00:13:27.159 --> 00:13:28.559
Do you have plans for the holidays?

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:30.240
Holidays?

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:33.039
What the heck is this?

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.679
The kid's mind is just full of potatoes right now.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.080
I don't know what else to say about him.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:39.639
You...

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.039
You're different. You're potato chips.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.399
Bro, is there anything else?

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:47.519
I don't have plans for this holiday.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.799
Like that movie...

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:51.159
Going to Hainan for fun.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.399
Sure!

00:13:53.039 --> 00:13:54.960
I, Li Wai, was born for sun and sand.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.399
Don't get too excited yet.

00:13:57.759 --> 00:13:59.240
My mom wants us to help count bugs.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.240
That's fine.

00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:02.200
No, bro, there aren't many people here.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:02.919
Where are you?

00:14:02.919 --> 00:14:03.559
I don't see you.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.679
I'm right here.

00:14:04.799 --> 00:14:05.440
Where are you?

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.279
I'm raising my hand.

00:14:08.039 --> 00:14:09.279
There's a popcorn head in front of me.

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:10.200
The kind with curls.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.039
Do you see me?

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:14.639
It's Reggae style.

00:14:18.039 --> 00:14:18.360
Me.

00:14:18.919 --> 00:14:19.799
Oh my god.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.320
No...

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.000
Bro...

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:23.320
How did you... You, you, you...

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.600
Why did you get this hairstyle?

00:14:24.679 --> 00:14:25.519
It's definitely shocking.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.120
Fashion. Retro.

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:28.639
This look of yours has exceeded...

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:30.320
...the scope of my understanding of fashion.

00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:32.600
Xu Rui!

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:33.799
Xu Rui!

00:14:34.279 --> 00:14:34.759
Xu Rui!

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:35.799
Xu Rui!

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.440
Xu Rui!

00:14:42.039 --> 00:14:43.360
Go, Sister Rui!

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:44.759
Number One Long Legs!

00:14:44.919 --> 00:14:46.159
Sister Rui, Sister Rui!

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.360
Come on, Xu Rui!

00:14:47.559 --> 00:14:48.399
Your attention seeker.

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:48.919
Come on!

00:14:48.919 --> 00:14:50.360
Go, Xu Rui!

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:51.919
I just like how he stands out.

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:53.320
Xu Rui, Xu Rui!

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.679
You stand out even more.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.360
Look at this PDA.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.600
Go, Xu Rui!

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.759
Number One Long Legs. Come here, let me say a few words.

00:14:58.759 --> 00:14:59.480
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.279
Listen to me for a moment.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:00.879
Students.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.360
Today is our...

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.240
...last training session before the competition.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.279
I hope everyone can seize this window of opportunity...

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.240
...to ramp up the intensity.

00:15:08.559 --> 00:15:09.960
So that during the competition...

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.360
...we can get a good result.

00:15:11.559 --> 00:15:12.159
Do you have confidence?

00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:13.240
Yes!

00:15:13.559 --> 00:15:14.440
Let's go! Let's go!

00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:15.639
Stretch out, stretch out.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.120
Xu Rui

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:24.600
Sister Rui

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.200
Come on

00:15:25.519 --> 00:15:26.159
Come on

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.159
Come on

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.960
Come on

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:31.559
Come on

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.759
Come on, Kong Xiaocan

00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:35.759
Why can you still smile so brightly?

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.320
Like nothing happened.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.679
So your mom becoming like this...

00:15:38.679 --> 00:15:39.519
...is all because of you, isn't it?

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.919
This thing... it's a bit complicated.

00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:42.039
So you're dying soon, right?

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.519
It's possible.

00:15:44.919 --> 00:15:45.480
Time to run.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.519
Everyone ready?

00:15:49.679 --> 00:15:51.399
On your marks.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.120
I traded fifty years of life energy for my mom.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.720
This matter...

00:15:55.919 --> 00:15:56.799
...if anyone finds out...

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:57.879
...there will be a punishment.

00:15:57.879 --> 00:16:00.639
A very, very severe punishment.

00:16:01.039 --> 00:16:02.720
Just forget everything I just said.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.639
I... I hope you'll be happy.

00:16:04.919 --> 00:16:06.240
But there are things I can't explain. Fine.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.360
It's a bit complicated. Anyway, it has nothing to do with me anymore.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.559
You know how much I like you.

00:16:08.559 --> 00:16:09.279
I have no choice.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.519
I'm sorry.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.000
So...

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:14.759
...this is the secret you couldn't tell me.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.559
The secret you've been carrying alone for so long.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.039
Xu Rui.

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:27.279
What happened?

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:27.799
Are you okay?

00:16:38.519 --> 00:16:39.679
I thought it was all healed.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.200
This is on me too.

00:16:43.159 --> 00:16:45.080
I knew you still had issues with that jerk...

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.480
...yet I still increased your training intensity.

00:16:46.799 --> 00:16:48.639
I only considered that your body could take it.

00:16:49.159 --> 00:16:50.440
I didn't consider your state of mind.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.120
My mistake.

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:54.720
Don't blame yourself, Coach.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.159
It's my fault for not adjusting my state properly.

00:16:57.159 --> 00:16:57.559
Say no more.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.080
I'll go reflect on it.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.680
Dear.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.960
What are you doing here?

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.960
Do you want to consider...

00:17:09.039 --> 00:17:10.640
...the trade to cure your ankle?

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.119
Last time I told you six years.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.119
Now I'm offering a huge discount.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.400
Five years and eleven months.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.720
I told you already.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.400
I'm not interested in your stuff.

00:17:18.519 --> 00:17:19.559
I don't know if others would trade.

00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:20.519
But I won't.

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:21.200
That's cheating.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.720
Then all those people outside...

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.559
...they are all your fellow athletes.

00:17:25.799 --> 00:17:26.960
Do any of them need a trade?

00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:29.039
You want me to help you drum up business, right?

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:31.920
Then I'll go myself.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:36.759
Let me ask you.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.759
You took fifty years from Xiaocan.

00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:41.480
What will the result be?

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.119
The result is Xiaocan lives fifty years less.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:48.759
Then...

00:17:52.279 --> 00:17:53.400
...when will he die?

00:17:54.079 --> 00:17:54.720
How will he die?

00:17:55.119 --> 00:17:56.079
Can you tell me?

00:17:57.319 --> 00:17:57.759
Dear.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.640
I am very sorry.

00:17:59.799 --> 00:18:01.680
I cannot comment.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.440
Business calls.

00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:08.880
I'll take my leave.

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:24.519
Are you okay, Xu Rui?

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.599
I'm fine. Just a scratch.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.319
You guys carry on.

00:18:26.599 --> 00:18:27.240
Are you sure?

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.039
I'm sure. I'm off.

00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:28.680
Take it easy then.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.039
It's fine.

00:18:31.359 --> 00:18:31.880
Xu Rui.

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:33.319
Xu Rui.

00:18:35.359 --> 00:18:35.880
How is it?

00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:38.039
Does it hurt now? Is it swollen?

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.799
Did they spray that medicine on you just now?

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.759
Can... can you still walk?

00:18:41.799 --> 00:18:42.279
Are you okay?

00:18:43.119 --> 00:18:44.200
Slow down. Slow down, slow down.

00:18:44.839 --> 00:18:46.160
What did they wrap this with?

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.519
It doesn't look swollen.

00:18:48.279 --> 00:18:49.720
Do you want to go to the hospital to check again?

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:51.680
Does... does it really not hurt?

00:18:52.319 --> 00:18:53.640
Are... are you unhappy?

00:18:57.799 --> 00:18:58.960
Don't... don't be unhappy.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.640
Bumps and bruises are normal.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.039
If... if you're really worried...

00:19:03.039 --> 00:19:04.240
Maybe we should still go to the hospital.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.440
It's fine.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.799
Come with me somewhere.

00:19:10.079 --> 00:19:11.319
Hurry up.

00:19:11.319 --> 00:19:12.559
Wait, is this necessary?

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:13.440
Taking photos too?

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.839
It took a lot of effort to get this look.

00:19:14.839 --> 00:19:15.720
It's embarrassing. Hurry up.

00:19:16.359 --> 00:19:17.720
So embarrassing. I've been styled like this.

00:19:19.119 --> 00:19:19.640
Come on, come on.

00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:20.480
Look forward. Look forward.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.640
Look happier.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.039
Smile.

00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:13.319
I'm done.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.359
No, no, no.

00:20:19.359 --> 00:20:20.759
What are you doing? I... I can't...

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.759
What? You still have an idol image?

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.440
I've always been in this lane.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.400
It'll look so ugly if I take it off.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:25.880
Don't move.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:26.759
No, you...

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.039
Is... is your foot okay?

00:20:29.119 --> 00:20:29.839
Do you want to go check it?

00:20:29.839 --> 00:20:30.400
It's fine now.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.559
I can even jump.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.440
Really, I'm fine.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:33.720
Don't move.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.519
No, no.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.519
This... this...

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.160
It's so ugly.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.759
This... of course it's so ugly.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.079
No way.

00:20:41.079 --> 00:20:42.160
I feel like I'm naked.

00:20:42.839 --> 00:20:44.240
Can't I just draw them on for you?

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.240
Let go.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.440
Don't move.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.400
This looks much better.

00:21:30.759 --> 00:21:32.680
A Fu's punishment is really strange.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.920
If it weren't for the hair and eyebrows falling out together...

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.000
For girls, this would be painless permanent hair removal.

00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:40.640
They'd wake up laughing from their dreams.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.759
Xu Rui, I shouldn't have dragged you into this.

00:21:47.559 --> 00:21:49.559
I'm actually quite happy.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.720
I finally know

00:21:52.279 --> 00:21:53.559
why you broke up with me.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.720
Why you wouldn't get back together.

00:21:56.519 --> 00:21:59.079
I finally understand your predicament.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.240
I'm sorry.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.519
No need to apologize.

00:22:04.359 --> 00:22:06.039
I know that to save your mom...

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.160
...you had no other choice.

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:08.480
Hiding it from me...

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.880
...was because you didn't want to make me sad.

00:22:13.319 --> 00:22:15.519
But I've already decided.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.079
No matter how long you have left to live...

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.680
...I will be with you.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.039
Maybe I'll be sad or regret it in the future...

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.119
...but I'm willing to bear that future.

00:22:39.799 --> 00:22:40.400
Xu Rui.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.440
Don't get emotional just yet.

00:22:43.839 --> 00:22:45.160
Have you thought about what to do later?

00:22:45.599 --> 00:22:46.240
What "later"?

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.119
You know...

00:22:49.079 --> 00:22:50.519
...if you really die.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.720
If I kick the bucket, I kick the bucket.

00:22:54.839 --> 00:22:56.000
Live well while I'm alive.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Cherish the present.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.559
And leave no regrets when I die.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.359
I knew you'd say that.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.000
And then?

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.480
Leave Auntie to us after she loses her son?

00:23:05.079 --> 00:23:07.039
Let me and Li Wai explain to Auntie...

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.400
...that to trade your life for hers...

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.480
...you left so early?

00:23:09.559 --> 00:23:10.359
You can't say that.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.039
Kong Xiaocan, let me tell you.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.319
You clean up your own mess.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.519
Figure out what to do.

00:23:18.079 --> 00:23:18.720
Also...

00:23:20.279 --> 00:23:21.839
Don't go around with that head. It's so ugly.

00:23:22.759 --> 00:23:23.160
Xu Rui.

00:23:26.759 --> 00:23:27.680
You turn hostile so fast.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.920
I don't think I ever thought about what comes after.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.359
What will my mom do without me?

00:23:41.039 --> 00:23:41.720
Regret it now?

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.039
If I hadn't traded my lifespan back then...

00:23:44.039 --> 00:23:45.640
...couldn't I have grown old with Xu Rui?

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.279
But...

00:23:48.119 --> 00:23:50.319
...could I just watch my mom leave me?

00:23:54.839 --> 00:23:55.480
Xiaocan.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.079
Xiaocan, look.

00:23:57.599 --> 00:23:59.160
Look at this selfie stick I just bought.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.240
It only cost 38.8.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.200
It's the upgraded version, too.

00:24:01.519 --> 00:24:02.519
It even has this little light.

00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:04.039
It makes people look really good.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:04.799
Let me tell you...

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:06.160
...let's take lots of photos this time.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.480
We haven't gone out for fun in ages.

00:24:09.039 --> 00:24:10.279
Your hair...

00:24:12.519 --> 00:24:13.400
Anyway, it's better than this morning.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.799
Come on, let's take a picture.

00:24:21.079 --> 00:24:21.920
One, two...

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.920
If I'm gone...

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.079
...how could my mom possibly accept it?

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.480
You silly child

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:35.319
What did I tell you?

00:24:36.759 --> 00:24:38.119
I told you to slack off a bit during training

00:24:38.519 --> 00:24:39.400
But you just had to work so hard

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.759
Luckily you didn't hurt the bone

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.960
Next time you train,

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.119
listen to Mom

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.279
You don't need to run so fast

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.000
Does it hurt?

00:24:55.519 --> 00:24:56.680
Did Mom press too hard?

00:25:02.839 --> 00:25:03.720
What's wrong?

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.000
What is it?

00:25:08.119 --> 00:25:09.720
Tell Mom what's on your mind

00:25:14.359 --> 00:25:15.039
Okay, don't say it, don't say it

00:25:15.599 --> 00:25:16.440
Don't cry. Don't cry

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.720
Stop crying. Stop crying

00:25:19.079 --> 00:25:19.519
Sweetheart

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.720
It's okay. Mom is here

00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:28.119
Hurry up, you two

00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:33.119
I really regret agreeing to go to Hainan

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.240
Why aren't we taking a plane?

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.319
Shut up, you two

00:25:36.759 --> 00:25:38.359
Look how diligent our Agricultural College classmates are

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.359
Look at what time Xiao Tian gets up to memorize words

00:25:40.359 --> 00:25:42.119
And look at what time Xu Rui gets up to train

00:25:43.359 --> 00:25:44.680
Other people's kids are always better

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.599
Even my mom thinks you're much better than me

00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:47.920
Everyone's mom thinks that

00:25:50.279 --> 00:25:51.279
Fang'er! Over here! Here!

00:25:51.359 --> 00:25:51.839
Here! Here! Here!

00:25:51.839 --> 00:25:52.599
Come on! Come on! Come on!

00:25:52.599 --> 00:25:53.000
Coming

00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:53.640
Fangfang

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.759
Fang'er, sit, sit, sit. Sit here

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.720
Okay, put it down. Leave it. I'll get it, I'll get it

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.279
Come, come, come. Put it over here

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.480
What did you bring? My goodness

00:26:01.079 --> 00:26:01.799
Careful

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.200
Careful. Careful. Careful

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.440
Then the two of us will be in front

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.359
We're going ahead now

00:26:05.359 --> 00:26:06.240
Okay, okay, okay. Bye

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.200
You guys chat. You guys chat

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:07.759
See you later

00:26:08.359 --> 00:26:09.440
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.640
Finally on board

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.039
Why are so many people going?

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:14.480
They all say they don't want to go,

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.920
but actually, they're either afraid of missing grad school points,

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.119
or they want to pad their resumes

00:26:18.359 --> 00:26:19.000
You have no idea

00:26:19.359 --> 00:26:21.079
After you chased Professor Wang out that day,

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.799
everyone signed up so enthusiastically

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:24.440
Come, come. Sit here

00:26:24.559 --> 00:26:26.039
Have you had that Hainan chicken rice?

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.400
It's here

00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:28.200
Did... did it go well?

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:28.720
Is it tasty?

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:29.319
Sister Rui

00:26:29.599 --> 00:26:30.079
Brother Xiaocan

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:30.839
Brother Li Wai

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:37.880
Let me check my bunk

00:26:39.599 --> 00:26:40.119
Cool

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:40.880
Cool, right?

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.279
Cool

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.960
Um, this spot is taken

00:26:43.079 --> 00:26:44.759
This is our bunk. Pass

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.039
Is the pork trotter rice from here?

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:46.920
No

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.759
Then it's from Guangdong

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:48.640
Come on

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.400
What's wrong?

00:26:49.839 --> 00:26:51.759
They're sitting on our bunks

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:53.960
Are you in the lower bunks?

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.880
It's a straight, can't help it

00:26:56.799 --> 00:26:57.759
Excuse me, excuse me

00:26:58.599 --> 00:27:00.359
Is your seat here on the lower bunk?

00:27:00.759 --> 00:27:01.880
We're just sitting for a bit

00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:02.880
Come on, hurry up

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.240
No, we're just playing cards...

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.720
This spot belongs to these young girls

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:08.920
I'll bomb you

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:09.799
Can I see your tickets?

00:27:09.799 --> 00:27:11.799
These two girls say this spot is theirs

00:27:12.839 --> 00:27:14.119
No, show me your ticket

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:15.799
Three with a pair

00:27:16.079 --> 00:27:16.920
These two girls...

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.079
...need to rest now

00:27:18.079 --> 00:27:19.519
You are occupying their seats

00:27:19.599 --> 00:27:19.960
Pass

00:27:21.519 --> 00:27:22.559
Did you hear what I said?

00:27:24.079 --> 00:27:24.880
If you keep this up...

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.799
I'm going to get the conductor and the train police

00:27:27.319 --> 00:27:27.640
Pass

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.160
Stop playing, stop playing

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.359
You're sitting in their spots

00:27:30.359 --> 00:27:31.359
Did you get their permission?

00:27:31.599 --> 00:27:32.480
Did you ask them?

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.759
They need to rest now

00:27:33.759 --> 00:27:34.640
Get out of here, now

00:27:35.319 --> 00:27:36.920
Where's your ticket? Hurry up, pack up

00:27:37.519 --> 00:27:39.359
Come on, let's go play cards over at my side

00:27:39.839 --> 00:27:40.480
What a killjoy

00:27:43.519 --> 00:27:44.680
Young girls these days...

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.240
You even got their bed dirty

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.079
Rest up, rest up

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.359
Thanks, Guifang

00:27:52.359 --> 00:27:52.960
Thanks

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.920
Guifang is really amazing

00:27:56.119 --> 00:27:58.400
Why am I starting to like her a little?

00:28:10.599 --> 00:28:11.440
Are you the only one here?

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.480
Take a corn to eat, hurry

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.279
Take it and eat

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:14.960
Okay, don't be shy

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:16.920
Here, taste what we developed ourselves

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:17.599
Take a bag with you

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:18.720
Professor Wang

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.200
Sit here, sit here

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.079
You cuties are here

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.519
Taste it, our self-developed products

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.400
Have a corn

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.359
I... I turned on the beauty filter

00:28:37.559 --> 00:28:38.799
Beauty filter is on, snap away

00:28:40.559 --> 00:28:41.519
Not taking photos anymore, never mind

00:28:43.839 --> 00:28:45.079
Why are you so uptight?

00:28:45.839 --> 00:28:47.240
Am I a tiger? Will I eat you?

00:28:48.759 --> 00:28:49.839
Am I usually that fierce?

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.599
No, no

00:28:50.599 --> 00:28:51.519
Am I fierce in class?

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.079
Professor Wang

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.920
This tomato is really delicious

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:56.720
What variety is it?

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.519
Newly developed

00:28:57.519 --> 00:28:58.039
Good, right?

00:28:59.000 --> 00:28:59.599
That explains it

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.039
I feel like tomatoes these days have less and less flavor

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:02.839
This is really good

00:29:02.839 --> 00:29:03.759
This not only has flavor...

00:29:03.759 --> 00:29:05.400
...but is also easy to transport and store

00:29:05.559 --> 00:29:06.400
So more people...

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.640
...can taste our new variety

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.759
This is why we study agriculture

00:29:12.759 --> 00:29:13.559
There's a rehearsal today

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.680
I'll pick you up in a bit

00:29:29.039 --> 00:29:29.720
My head.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.440
My intelligence and wisdom.

00:29:31.799 --> 00:29:32.480
All knocked out of me.

00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:33.400
Are you okay, Brother Li Wai?

00:29:33.799 --> 00:29:35.400
My god, this upper bunk is hard on the head.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.559
My god, I can't even straighten my back.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.400
Can't straighten my legs either.

00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:41.599
But do you know what this upper bunk is good for?

00:29:44.279 --> 00:29:45.960
Doing planks.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.000
Godmother, what good stuff are you eating?

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:53.880
There's good food over there.

00:29:54.319 --> 00:29:54.640
Let's go.

00:29:55.599 --> 00:29:55.960
Let's go.

00:29:56.359 --> 00:29:58.319
I'll count one, two, three, see who climbs down faster.

00:29:58.559 --> 00:29:58.960
Okay.

00:29:59.559 --> 00:29:59.960
One.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.000
Three.

00:30:10.119 --> 00:30:11.319
I can't find the foothold, wait a sec.

00:30:12.839 --> 00:30:13.640
This is too hard to get down from.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.000
Sorry, brother.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.440
Brother Xiaocan, Sister Xu Rui.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.119
Why don't you join us...

00:30:22.119 --> 00:30:22.759
Tian, Tian, Tian.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.240
Uh, let's go eat something good.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.119
Let's not stay here and watch the PDA.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:25.920
Let's go.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.119
Godmother.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.400
Godmother.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.680
Before, I...

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.960
didn't feel it that much.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.759
But these past two days, I've been really scared.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.960
Can't sleep at night.

00:30:41.599 --> 00:30:42.200
I was thinking,

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.880
if I really just suddenly disappeared,

00:30:47.359 --> 00:30:48.559
what would my mom do all alone?

00:30:54.039 --> 00:30:55.319
You're only scared now?

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:02.880
Alright, alright.

00:31:03.039 --> 00:31:04.440
Go, chat with them.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:05.559
Go.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.240
You saw it.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.680
Saw it this time.

00:31:12.279 --> 00:31:12.799
We...

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:13.440
No.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.160
That must be someone sticking their head out.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:15.920
Get me two oranges.

00:31:17.119 --> 00:31:17.440
Here.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:17.880
Give me one.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.359
Thanks, thanks.

00:31:20.119 --> 00:31:21.480
And that corn smells really good too.

00:31:22.079 --> 00:31:22.720
The size is a bit bigger.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.039
Right?

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.200
This corn is a new variety too.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.759
Didn't you notice it's bigger than the others?

00:31:53.799 --> 00:31:54.119
Right?

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.839
Didn't you notice this corn...

00:31:55.839 --> 00:31:56.359
The orange dropped.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.599
It's okay, I got it, I got it.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.480
Excuse me, sorry.

00:32:00.079 --> 00:32:00.799
Sorry, excuse me.

00:32:00.799 --> 00:32:01.200
Sorry.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
The tomato is really delicious.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
It looks good too.

00:32:11.319 --> 00:32:12.200
Taste this.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.640
Seemed like something flashed by.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.599
This is just an orange.

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:15.039
Is it?

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.599
Try it, maybe I'm seeing things.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:23.799
It is indeed quite tasty.

00:32:23.799 --> 00:32:24.240
Thanks.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.200
This is my Coke.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:27.960
Forget it, you drink it.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:28.480
I don't want it anymore.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:53.680
Husband.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.799
Let's name our child Aotian.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.200
Xiaocan.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:19.400
Xiaocan.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.680
Are you okay?

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:22.799
Xiaocan.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.200
Open the door, please.

00:33:24.759 --> 00:33:25.839
Open the door first.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:27.160
Xiaocan.

00:33:27.559 --> 00:33:28.400
Open the door!

00:33:29.359 --> 00:33:29.880
Xiaocan.

00:33:30.079 --> 00:33:32.240
I'm fine, just let me be alone for a while.

00:33:37.119 --> 00:33:38.839
It's just that gathering energy is hard for you too.

00:33:38.839 --> 00:33:40.559
We will provide a portion of benefits...

00:33:40.559 --> 00:33:41.319
as compensation.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.880
Like curing diseases, becoming beautiful or handsome.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:43.960
Changing appearance and stuff.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.400
Are you this unprofessional?

00:34:02.799 --> 00:34:03.359
Dear

00:34:03.839 --> 00:34:06.200
Don't summon me on a vehicle.

00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:07.920
It's tiring for me to chase you.

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:08.880
I want to make a trade.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:09.800
Dear

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:11.000
What do you want to trade?

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:11.920
Xiaocan's hair.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.280
Dear, the punishment cannot be revoked.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.119
It's not revoking.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.280
It's exchanging life energy for Xiaocan's hair follicles.

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:20.719
Three months.

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:22.199
It should grow this long.

00:34:22.599 --> 00:34:23.480
I'll give you one month.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:24.719
To make his hair grow this long.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.719
Dear, a discount on such a small trade?

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.719
One month minus the cost, and I'd be losing money.

00:34:32.039 --> 00:34:33.880
You only look at immediate gains and losses.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.920
That's why your business won't grow.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.880
Look at how we Earthlings do business.

00:34:37.039 --> 00:34:38.320
The first order always gets a discount.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.239
So there will be a second order.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.920
You aliens need to have a long-term vision.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.159
A one-time deal

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:45.000
Is not as good as a steady, continuous stream.

00:34:45.519 --> 00:34:46.840
Just consider it securing me as a repeat customer.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:47.719
Okay?

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:48.800
No.

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:50.360
I haven't tried this before.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:50.880
Hurry up.

00:34:51.079 --> 00:34:51.599
Okay.

00:35:20.519 --> 00:35:21.000
Xu Rui.

00:35:26.039 --> 00:35:28.039
Okay, since the trade is complete,

00:35:28.239 --> 00:35:29.079
I'll take my leave now.

00:35:29.679 --> 00:35:30.559
What did you trade?

00:35:30.559 --> 00:35:31.079
See you next time.

00:35:31.079 --> 00:35:31.519
You...

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:32.880
Open up for me.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:33.440
Xiaocan.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:33.960
Open up.

00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:34.519
Xiaocan.

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:35.000
Open up.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:35.480
Xiaocan.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:35.880
Open up.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.440
Alright, alright.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.360
What trade did you make with him?

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.639
It was all voluntary. Voluntary.

00:35:38.719 --> 00:35:39.440
How much time did you trade?

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.599
Not much, just one month.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.039
One month.

00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:44.519
No way.

00:35:44.519 --> 00:35:45.320
I'm fine.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.400
Not even a day, not even a second.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.400
Why did you get tricked?

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.000
Don't...

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:48.960
It's really not necessary for my hair. It's fine.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.760
I did it voluntarily. Voluntarily.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.079
And the trade can't be cancelled. Open up.

00:35:51.199 --> 00:35:52.440
There's no way to cancel it.

00:35:52.599 --> 00:35:53.159
It was worth it.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.039
It was worth it, Xiaocan.

00:35:54.119 --> 00:35:55.800
This hair is so handsome.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:56.880
Look.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.199
It grew out.

00:36:01.239 --> 00:36:02.320
Didn't I tell you?

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.119
I will face this future together with you.

00:36:06.079 --> 00:36:07.159
You can rely on me.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.400
Everything will be alright.

00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:15.280
I don't know how much time I have left.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.639
But I'll use this short life I have left...

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:21.760
To treat you well.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.480
Did I make a loss?

00:36:47.519 --> 00:36:48.000
A Fu.

00:36:48.559 --> 00:36:49.159
This month,

00:36:49.159 --> 00:36:51.199
You're still short 150 years of life energy.

00:36:51.559 --> 00:36:53.360
If you don't finish, your wages will be deducted.

00:36:54.239 --> 00:36:54.840
Don't deduct, don't deduct.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.280
I can definitely finish it.

00:36:57.039 --> 00:36:57.719
Good luck.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.639
I heard Hainan's mangoes are huge, sweet, and cheap.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.920
What kind of magical place is Hainan?

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.440
Is there a way to make fruit delicious there?

00:37:15.639 --> 00:37:16.480
Hainan.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.519
Passengers,

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.000
The train is about to be split and loaded onto the ship.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.039
To cross the Qiongzhou Strait.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.239
Due to uncontrollable natural causes,

00:37:38.679 --> 00:37:40.440
The train will arrive late.

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.960
Please accept our apologies for the inconvenience.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.000
Not sleeping yet?

00:38:14.599 --> 00:38:15.480
If I sleep a while longer,

00:38:16.239 --> 00:38:17.559
I'll spend a little less time with you.

00:38:20.519 --> 00:38:21.840
Then do you know,

00:38:22.639 --> 00:38:25.360
Staying up late like this makes you die faster?

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:30.679
Okay.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:31.920
Goodnight then.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:35.840
Go to sleep.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:46.480
Godmother

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.559
Godmother

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.239
Look at Aotian, whom my Xiaoyin gave birth to

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.639
He looks so much like Xiaocan

00:38:56.519 --> 00:38:58.239
Right, Sister Rui?

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.519
You're up alone in the middle of the night?

00:40:38.639 --> 00:40:39.119
I...

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.760
I can't sleep on the train

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:42.239
How about you?

00:40:44.159 --> 00:40:44.760
Me neither

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.639
What's wrong?

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.039
Something on your mind?

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.079
Tell me about it

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.880
Originally, I signed with Brother Maizi

00:41:11.559 --> 00:41:13.000
because I wanted to help the folks back home

00:41:14.199 --> 00:41:15.760
I wanted to find a market for everyone's potatoes

00:41:16.679 --> 00:41:17.480
and improve their lives

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.039
I didn't want to leave my impoverished hometown behind

00:41:23.719 --> 00:41:25.159
I wanted my hometown to leave poverty behind

00:41:29.079 --> 00:41:30.079
But why do I feel like

00:41:31.079 --> 00:41:32.519
that path is getting further and further away from me?

00:41:36.639 --> 00:41:37.480
If I said

00:41:38.639 --> 00:41:39.760
I want to terminate the contract and quit

00:41:40.519 --> 00:41:41.079
what would you think?

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.800
I don't really understand the entertainment industry

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.519
but if you say you don't want to do it anymore

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.199
then I'll definitely support you

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.760
I just realized this current path is wrong

00:42:01.079 --> 00:42:02.039
But I also don't know

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:03.880
what to do after terminating the contract

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.360
Before

00:42:13.719 --> 00:42:15.000
my life goal

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.880
was just to go to college

00:42:18.519 --> 00:42:19.519
Now that's been achieved

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.760
But what then?

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.440
Is my life for Xiaocan?

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.920
Or is it like you

00:42:29.519 --> 00:42:30.400
promoting my hometown?

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:32.960
Or perhaps

00:42:34.239 --> 00:42:36.199
I can be like Professor Wang

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.760
and have a greater purpose?

00:42:42.159 --> 00:42:42.840
I don't know

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000
But I believe

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.239
that is the meaning of our hard work in studying

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.440
As long as we study hard

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.960
someday in the future

00:42:57.639 --> 00:42:58.679
we will all be able to find

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.400
the path that belongs to us

00:43:17.559 --> 00:43:18.159
A shooting star!

00:43:18.719 --> 00:43:19.079
Where?

00:43:19.079 --> 00:43:19.440
Look

00:43:32.679 --> 00:43:33.599
I wish

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:37.840
that Xiao Tian can be himself, free and at ease

00:45:08.519 --> 00:45:08.960
Classmates

00:45:09.559 --> 00:45:11.360
Get up, get up, get up! Look at the sunrise!

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:12.039
Hurry, hurry, hurry

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:13.840
Hurry! Get up!

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:14.400
Watch the sunrise

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.760
The sun rises so early at sea

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:35.519
Hello?

00:46:35.599 --> 00:46:36.400
Hello? Hello? Brother?

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.840
What time is it? What time is it?

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:38.880
I'm...

00:46:39.119 --> 00:46:39.960
Where are you?

00:46:40.119 --> 00:46:41.039
I... I'm at the door.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.679
Which door are you at?

00:46:43.119 --> 00:46:44.079
This door, Brother.

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:48.880
Sorry, Brother.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.000
I'm l-late. I'm late.

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.320
Wait a second, wait, wait.

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.800
Why are you alone? Where's Xiao Tian?

00:46:54.079 --> 00:46:54.679
X-Xiao Tian...

00:46:55.079 --> 00:46:55.760
Yes, yes.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.280
I just got the news myself.

00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.840
It's such bad timing.

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.760
Xiao Tian's grandma is having a second child.

00:47:02.159 --> 00:47:03.320
Yeah, anyway, he...

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.519
He really has a family emergency.

00:47:04.519 --> 00:47:05.519
It's urgent. He can't make it.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.440
But it's okay, it's okay, Brother.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:08.679
The rehearsal won't be delayed.

00:47:09.559 --> 00:47:10.000
Brother.

00:47:11.239 --> 00:47:11.880
I'll fill in for him.

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.280
No...

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.519
Boss, am I supposed to play a couple with him?

00:47:19.719 --> 00:47:21.639
No, no, no, sister. No, no, sister.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:22.360
Don't worry.

00:47:22.639 --> 00:47:23.599
It's with our artist.

00:47:23.599 --> 00:47:24.480
It's just that for today's rehearsal,

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.320
I-I... I'll just walk through the blocking for him.

00:47:26.639 --> 00:47:27.320
Don't worry, Brother.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.199
The blocking, the positions, I've memorized them all.

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.199
It's all in my head.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:34.559
Don't be like that. I really know how.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.119
Did you forget when we were kids,

00:47:36.119 --> 00:47:37.519
we entered a dance competition together?

00:47:37.519 --> 00:47:38.039
Shut your mouth.

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:39.800
I'm telling you one more time.

00:47:40.239 --> 00:47:41.079
I don't know you.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.400
Understood. No, no, no.

00:47:43.039 --> 00:47:44.239
L-Look at my memory.

00:47:44.519 --> 00:47:45.000
It's like this.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000
If you don't believe me, watch.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.559
I really can do it. I really can. You...

00:47:48.039 --> 00:47:48.519
Look.

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:49.960
Right? Yes.

00:47:50.039 --> 00:47:50.800
Right? Right? Right?

00:47:51.119 --> 00:47:51.679
Ballroom.

00:47:52.039 --> 00:47:52.519
Ballroom.

00:47:53.079 --> 00:47:54.039
You really are a fool.

00:47:54.199 --> 00:47:55.519
No, don't doubt me.

00:47:55.519 --> 00:47:56.800
I... Look at this Moonwalk.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.719
I want to kill you right now.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:01.480
Come on, get out.

00:48:02.039 --> 00:48:03.639
I said get out! Get out! Don't stay here.

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:04.679
I said get out...

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.280
I said... I said get out...

00:48:06.639 --> 00:48:07.360
I said get out...

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:09.480
Brother, Brother!

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:10.920
The rehearsal! Don't delay the rehearsal!

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:11.480
Get lost!

00:48:12.159 --> 00:48:13.119
No, wait, wait, wait...

00:48:13.119 --> 00:48:14.119
Should we reschedule or...

00:48:14.119 --> 00:48:14.760
Get lost!

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:15.320
Alrighty!

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:17.679
Then same time next year we...

00:48:18.119 --> 00:48:18.760
Get lost!
