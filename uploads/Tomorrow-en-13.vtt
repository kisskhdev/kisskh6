00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:29.781
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:35.078
Favorite movie.

00:00:35.078 --> 00:00:37.246
It feels like this
song is for you.

00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:39.999
It’s funny because they
thought it was for Clea.

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:41.125
You do love me, right?

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:42.627
If I say yes, what will you do?

00:00:43.086 --> 00:00:44.712
Your aunt called earlier.

00:00:45.213 --> 00:00:46.464
What about, Pa?

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.051
She said she’ll take care
of your papers for Spain.

00:00:51.678 --> 00:00:54.889
For our anniversary,
we have an out-of-town—

00:00:56.432 --> 00:00:57.266
shoot.

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.102
But that’s our anniversary.

00:00:59.102 --> 00:01:01.604
I miss my boyfriend so much.

00:01:01.604 --> 00:01:03.147
He’s there with someone else.

00:01:03.147 --> 00:01:04.816
With another girl. I’m done.

00:01:04.816 --> 00:01:06.359
- Love? Come on, let’s go.
- Oh my gosh, Arkin.

00:01:06.693 --> 00:01:07.443
Stand up.

00:01:09.362 --> 00:01:10.363
I’m sorry.

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:14.993
I love you more than every
lyric I could ever write.

00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:18.454
I love you so much, Kino.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.292
Via! Have you seen this?

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.119
Oh my gosh, that make-out
session is so hot!

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:42.163
Everyone here who’s single
is jealous again!

00:02:42.163 --> 00:02:44.864
Please, ArClea is such
a power couple!

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:46.872
Don’t break up, please!

00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:03.669
Are you heading out now,
sweetheart?

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.937
Are you feeling okay now?

00:03:07.313 --> 00:03:09.649
Yes, Pa. I’m feeling
a bit better now.

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:12.276
And I really need to
go to school today.

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.779
We have an exam next week.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.908
Don’t push yourself
too hard, okay?

00:03:18.908 --> 00:03:19.951
Make sure you rest.

00:03:22.161 --> 00:03:24.163
And sweetheart,
whatever's going on,

00:03:24.914 --> 00:03:26.791
it’s okay to cry to Papa.

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.755
It’s okay to tell me if you’re
struggling or if you’re hurting.

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:35.383
You know Papa
is always here for you.

00:03:38.052 --> 00:03:39.053
Yes.

00:03:39.804 --> 00:03:41.097
Thanks, Pa.

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:49.480
I can carry all your
pain for you, okay?

00:03:57.238 --> 00:03:58.781
Papa, thank you.

00:03:59.907 --> 00:04:01.325
Thank you.

00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:11.169
Pa, I need to go now.

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:12.587
I’m going to be late.

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:14.630
All right then.

00:04:15.006 --> 00:04:16.549
Have dinner here, okay?

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.092
I’ll cook something good.

00:04:18.092 --> 00:04:19.051
Yeah.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.636
Thank you.

00:04:35.902 --> 00:04:38.196
Kino, how are you?

00:04:38.196 --> 00:04:39.739
I’m starting to worry about you.

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:41.282
Please let me know you’re okay.

00:04:41.282 --> 00:04:42.950
Kino!

00:04:56.172 --> 00:04:57.757
Via, I heard you’re coming to school?

00:04:57.757 --> 00:04:59.717
Are you okay now?
Are you on the way?

00:05:04.222 --> 00:05:05.556
I’m okay.

00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:07.350
I just need to print some things.

00:05:07.767 --> 00:05:09.769
I’ll probably eat here first.

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:12.021
I’ll go there. Wait for me.

00:05:13.731 --> 00:05:15.733
Okay. Take care.

00:05:19.153 --> 00:05:20.238
Via.

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:24.617
Don’t you dare touch me.
Just stay there.

00:05:27.662 --> 00:05:28.663
Via, please.

00:05:31.415 --> 00:05:34.460
You couldn’t even text
or call me last night.

00:05:37.672 --> 00:05:39.090
Via, it’s because—

00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:46.138
Don’t follow me.
Your fans might see you.

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:49.475
Via, wait—

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:51.644
Via, please listen to me first.

00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:54.522
I didn’t want any of it to happen.

00:05:57.858 --> 00:05:59.568
Why did you only show up now?

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.697
Do you even care
about how I feel?

00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:04.031
Did it really mean nothing to you

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:06.784
that I was almost losing my
mind over all the scenarios

00:06:06.784 --> 00:06:08.160
running through my head?

00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:10.663
Larkin, why?

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:15.668
Via, I’m sorry I couldn’t talk
to you right away.

00:06:18.004 --> 00:06:19.880
My manager took my phone.

00:06:20.756 --> 00:06:22.049
He didn’t even want
me to come today,

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:24.510
but I snuck out just to be here.

00:06:26.971 --> 00:06:28.431
Are you happy right now?

00:06:30.975 --> 00:06:33.352
Are you happy you get
to kiss her all the time?

00:06:39.483 --> 00:06:41.277
Are you happier with her?

00:06:42.278 --> 00:06:43.404
Via…

00:06:43.404 --> 00:06:44.405
Via, no.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.871
I only did that to protect you.

00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:56.792
Via, I’m so sorry.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.130
I wasn’t happy doing it.

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:05.092
I never wanted to do it
behind your back.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.389
This is the only way
for me to protect you

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:13.351
from what you’re most afraid of.

00:07:13.351 --> 00:07:14.560
I’d do it, Via.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.436
I would do everything.

00:07:15.436 --> 00:07:16.771
You know that, right?

00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:19.148
You’ll protect me?

00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:23.027
How are you protecting me
with what you did, Larkin?

00:07:23.027 --> 00:07:24.945
You just hurt me.

00:07:26.614 --> 00:07:28.032
Do you even have any idea?

00:07:33.204 --> 00:07:34.455
Via, I didn’t want to do it.

00:07:34.455 --> 00:07:36.123
Please, just listen to me first, okay?

00:07:36.665 --> 00:07:37.875
Let’s talk.

00:07:38.626 --> 00:07:40.336
Just not here.
There are too many people.

00:07:49.595 --> 00:07:52.223
Via, are you okay?

00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:55.309
Do you have a fever?

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:57.436
Fuck.

00:07:57.895 --> 00:07:59.855
What are you feeling? Huh?

00:07:59.855 --> 00:08:00.981
Are you okay?

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.568
Oh my gosh, it’s Larkin Sanchez!

00:08:04.568 --> 00:08:06.112
Hey! It really is Larkin!

00:08:06.112 --> 00:08:06.904
Come on!

00:08:06.904 --> 00:08:08.447
- Is it really him?
- Larkin!

00:08:08.447 --> 00:08:10.199
Larkin! Take a photo with us!

00:08:12.118 --> 00:08:15.329
- Larkin! Larkin!
- Take a photo with us, Larkin!

00:08:15.955 --> 00:08:19.166
- Larkin! Larkin!
- It’s really Larkin!

00:08:20.126 --> 00:08:20.918
Via!

00:08:24.296 --> 00:08:25.840
Larkin Sanchez!

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.883
Larkin Sanchez!

00:08:28.134 --> 00:08:29.218
Larkin Sanchez!

00:08:30.094 --> 00:08:33.180
- Larkin! Larkin!
- Via!

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.140
Larkin!

00:08:38.894 --> 00:08:39.895
Larkin!

00:08:40.771 --> 00:08:41.772
Via!

00:08:41.772 --> 00:08:44.191
- Larkin!
- Larkin!

00:08:44.608 --> 00:08:46.360
- Larkin!
- Via!

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.653
Larkin Sanchez!

00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:00.666
Via?

00:09:01.333 --> 00:09:02.585
- Larkin!
- Larkin!

00:09:02.585 --> 00:09:03.586
Larkin!

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.851
Via?

00:09:06.714 --> 00:09:08.257
- Larkin!
- Larkin!

00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:12.031
Via!

00:09:12.887 --> 00:09:14.597
- Larkin!
- Come on!

00:09:17.433 --> 00:09:18.309
Idol!

00:09:18.309 --> 00:09:20.936
Via, come on, get up.
Oh my gosh.

00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:37.036
- Larkin!
- Larkin!

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:48.797
Say hi to my followers.

00:09:49.715 --> 00:09:51.342
Larkin’s right here!

00:09:51.842 --> 00:09:52.843
Larkin!

00:09:55.179 --> 00:09:57.973
- Larkin!
- Larkin!

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.351
Idol!

00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:04.832
That Arkin is such an asshole,

00:11:04.832 --> 00:11:06.917
having the nerve
to cheat on Clea.

00:11:06.917 --> 00:11:09.795
Seriously, Larkin Sanchez?
You’re disgusting.

00:11:09.795 --> 00:11:11.714
Whoever that girl
is in the picture,

00:11:11.714 --> 00:11:14.174
I hope you know the guy you’re
hugging already has a girlfriend!

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.969
Guys, let’s wait for
Larkin’s explanation first.

00:11:16.969 --> 00:11:19.179
Let’s not judge too quickly.

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:21.849
We all know how
much Arkin loves Clea.

00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:25.269
All I know is you’re already
so lucky to have Clea, Arkin.

00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:28.397
You’d be an idiot to even think
about cheating on her.

00:11:31.525 --> 00:11:33.694
I wonder how Kino is feeling.

00:11:38.532 --> 00:11:43.370
“Larkin Sanchez talks about
the girl in the photo!”

00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:51.211
No, we’re not in a relationship.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.047
She’s just a close fan of mine.

00:11:53.047 --> 00:11:55.591
I just happened to pass by
the area to buy something,

00:11:55.591 --> 00:11:56.925
and that’s when she saw me.

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:59.094
But why were you
embracing each other?

00:11:59.553 --> 00:12:00.763
No, we weren’t.

00:12:01.138 --> 00:12:03.307
She was sick, she passed out,

00:12:03.307 --> 00:12:05.184
and I was just helping her up.

00:12:05.184 --> 00:12:07.186
I mean, of course...

00:12:07.186 --> 00:12:08.604
I couldn’t just leave a fan like that.

00:12:08.604 --> 00:12:11.398
I mean, if anyone passed out
in front of me, right?

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.359
Does Clea know about it?

00:12:13.359 --> 00:12:14.526
Of course.

00:12:15.319 --> 00:12:16.737
I explained everything to her.

00:12:16.737 --> 00:12:18.197
She understood the situation.

00:12:18.697 --> 00:12:20.282
Actually, I’m on my way
to see her right now.

00:12:20.282 --> 00:12:21.659
I just want to
make sure she’s okay.

00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:23.285
So don’t worry.

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:24.870
We didn’t fight.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.829
We’re good.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.124
And yeah, it wasn’t a big deal.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:31.919
Thank you.

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:33.337
Sorry, I’ve got to go.

00:12:33.337 --> 00:12:34.367
Thank you.

00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:42.012
I’m sorry, Kino.

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:47.685
I know it hurts for you
to say all of that.

00:12:52.356 --> 00:12:54.149
This is really hard.

00:12:54.692 --> 00:12:57.945
I just want to keep you to myself,
away from everyone.

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:23.387
Hey! Isn’t the girl who hugged
Larkin from our school?

00:13:23.387 --> 00:13:24.179
Also the same course, architecture.

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:25.408
Could she be our batchmate?

00:13:26.265 --> 00:13:28.809
Honestly, she looks
kind of familiar.

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:31.270
Didn’t Larkin already
clear that up last night?

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.229
She’s just a fan.

00:13:32.229 --> 00:13:33.897
Don’t make such a big deal out of it.

00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:34.982
Why don’t you just review instead?

00:13:34.982 --> 00:13:36.150
The exam’s coming up.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.359
The heck?

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:39.027
Aren’t you here to gossip, too?

00:13:39.403 --> 00:13:40.738
- Familiar, right?
- Hey, let me see.

00:13:40.738 --> 00:13:42.322
Looks really familiar.

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:44.032
Right?

00:13:44.533 --> 00:13:45.451
Yeah, it’s her.

00:13:45.451 --> 00:13:46.785
I know her.

00:13:54.084 --> 00:13:55.085
What?

00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:56.336
Are you going to tell me again

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.213
that Larkin is actually cheating on Clea?

00:13:58.213 --> 00:13:59.214
No.

00:13:59.882 --> 00:14:01.550
They said they’re fine, right?

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:03.886
People are just really being
too much these days,

00:14:03.886 --> 00:14:06.221
assuming things
over a simple photo.

00:14:06.555 --> 00:14:07.389
The way they’re reacting,

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:10.267
you’d think Larkin was
making out with another girl.

00:14:56.188 --> 00:14:58.816
Guys, let’s put the issue
to rest already, okay?

00:14:58.816 --> 00:15:00.567
Larkin already clarified it.

00:15:01.193 --> 00:15:03.987
Exactly! Let’s trust Larkin’s word.

00:15:03.987 --> 00:15:07.241
Let’s just support him and
not add to the hate train!

00:15:52.995 --> 00:15:54.048
Via.

00:15:55.859 --> 00:15:56.860
Here’s a jacket.

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:58.141
Huh?

00:15:58.166 --> 00:15:59.454
You were sick recently, right?

00:16:03.005 --> 00:16:04.047
Wear it already.

00:16:04.868 --> 00:16:05.869
I’ll carry this.

00:16:13.724 --> 00:16:14.725
Via!

00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:18.395
I’m sorry.

00:16:20.147 --> 00:16:21.481
Huh? For what?

00:16:26.859 --> 00:16:27.902
I’ll take this.

00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:29.698
Via—

00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:31.617
Let him be. Come on.

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:34.036
Never mind him. Just let it be.

00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:36.496
Via, hey.

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:42.085
Isn’t she the girl Arkin was hugging
in España?

00:16:42.085 --> 00:16:43.211
Who the fuck is that girl?

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:44.563
I thought she was just a fan!

00:16:44.588 --> 00:16:45.923
You’re such a slut!

00:16:45.923 --> 00:16:47.799
I know her. She’s Avianna Diaz.

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.760
I hope karma hits you both!

00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:53.305
Seriously, Arkin?
You’d replace Clea with that trash?

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:54.806
She’s ugly.

00:16:55.853 --> 00:16:57.559
- Whore!
- Cheater!

00:16:57.584 --> 00:16:58.587
Via?

00:17:00.479 --> 00:17:01.480
Are you okay?

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.733
It’s not true. Come on.

00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:08.362
Via!

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:27.673
Via?

00:17:32.678 --> 00:17:34.304
I’m just right here, okay?

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:38.392
Do you want to go outside?

00:17:41.228 --> 00:17:43.188
Come on, let’s talk.

00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:47.484
Via?

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:24.855
Via.

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:29.026
It’s okay.

00:18:32.154 --> 00:18:34.156
I’m right here.

00:18:34.156 --> 00:18:35.657
We’re here.

00:18:37.159 --> 00:18:39.828
You don’t deserve
the things they’re saying.

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:43.540
Because none of it is true.

00:18:45.167 --> 00:18:46.835
That’s not who you are.

00:18:48.045 --> 00:18:50.047
And Arkin knows that.

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:52.716
Sevi knows,

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:55.719
Sam knows,

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.346
Ke knows.

00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:01.516
We all know.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.687
We know the truth, Via.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:15.243
Do you want me
to make a scene, too?

00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:18.909
So they can all
gang up on me, too.

00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:20.619
I’ll go through it with you.

00:19:30.796 --> 00:19:33.131
I want to go home, Luna.

00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:38.553
I know.

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:41.515
Just stay strong, okay?

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:46.478
You and Arkin will talk about this.

00:19:47.896 --> 00:19:50.148
Everything will be okay.

00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:55.403
But if you want to cry right now,

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:58.615
I’ll be here with you.

00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:01.326
We’ll cry together.

00:20:04.121 --> 00:20:05.539
Don’t cry anymore.

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:21.429
Oh my gosh!
Have you seen it?

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:24.307
Who’s that girl clinging
to Larkin, like, seriously?

00:20:24.307 --> 00:20:26.560
She’s so ugly.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.397
Like, Larkin is for Clea only.

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:32.149
No one else.

00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:34.818
Poor Clea,

00:20:34.818 --> 00:20:37.320
she got replaced by a
girl who isn’t even pretty.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.948
But he doesn’t eat betamax.

00:20:40.282 --> 00:20:41.366
It’s kikam—

00:20:42.033 --> 00:20:43.034
Via!

00:20:43.034 --> 00:20:44.744
- Hey! Are you okay?
- Miss, be careful.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:46.830
Does anything hurt?
Are you okay?

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.792
Side-chick! You’re a digrace.

00:20:52.377 --> 00:20:53.962
Rye, thank you so much.

00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:54.754
Congratulations!

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.007
That’s how much I love you.

00:20:57.174 --> 00:20:58.925
Wow!

00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:01.219
A very heartwarming message.

00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:02.679
Thank you, Rye!

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:06.099
Thank you, Rye!

00:21:18.968 --> 00:21:21.846
Via? Are you okay?

00:21:24.288 --> 00:21:25.456
I’m okay.

00:21:26.891 --> 00:21:28.017
I’m just here, Via.

00:21:28.042 --> 00:21:29.836
If you need anything, I’m here.

00:21:31.895 --> 00:21:33.021
Thanks.

00:21:54.618 --> 00:21:57.162
Cheaters and liars should go to hell.

00:21:57.162 --> 00:22:00.248
The same goes for
women who are willing

00:22:00.248 --> 00:22:02.793
to ruin a relationship
just to satisfy their urges.

00:22:18.896 --> 00:22:20.267
They’ve been together
for a long time,

00:22:20.292 --> 00:22:21.430
since high school!

00:22:21.544 --> 00:22:24.214
I was schoolmates
with both of them.

00:22:24.369 --> 00:22:27.237
I feel like Clea was just used
so he could become famous.

00:22:29.867 --> 00:22:31.746
Do you really think
you know the people

00:22:31.746 --> 00:22:33.289
you see on TV?

00:22:33.289 --> 00:22:36.126
Arkin beat me up back
when he was in high school.

00:22:36.568 --> 00:22:39.174
Damn him, he’s a bully,
that asshole.

00:23:04.057 --> 00:23:05.553
Are you okay?

00:23:20.289 --> 00:23:21.456
Be careful, all right?

00:23:21.481 --> 00:23:24.333
You might get sick if you
don’t wipe off your sweat.

00:23:24.543 --> 00:23:26.211
And when you run,
you might trip.

00:23:26.211 --> 00:23:27.170
So be careful.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:27.963
Okay.

00:23:27.963 --> 00:23:29.756
- We’re just gonna play in front.
- All right.

00:23:34.094 --> 00:23:35.095
Hi, Via!

00:23:35.637 --> 00:23:37.556
- Via, I’ll take care of that.
- No, it’s okay.

00:23:37.556 --> 00:23:38.557
- It’s fine.
- No, it’s okay.

00:23:38.557 --> 00:23:39.725
Just go take a bath.

00:23:39.725 --> 00:23:41.351
- Just go upstairs and take a bath.
- Are you sure?

00:23:41.351 --> 00:23:42.060
Yes.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.204
- Just bring this, and this too so—
- Okay.

00:23:44.229 --> 00:23:45.355
- we can clean this mess.
- I’ll handle this.

00:23:45.355 --> 00:23:46.356
All right.

00:24:03.402 --> 00:24:06.166
Clea, you don’t deserve
someone like Arkin, queen.

00:24:06.191 --> 00:24:08.015
Break up with him.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.402
We don’t care about
the love team anymore.

00:24:10.521 --> 00:24:14.854
Let him be with his
ugly mistress. @aviannadiaz

00:25:53.658 --> 00:25:56.035
Via, can we talk?

00:26:01.533 --> 00:26:02.701
I’m sorry.

00:26:03.438 --> 00:26:05.732
Sorry about the
pictures that came out.

00:26:06.243 --> 00:26:09.330
Huh? Why are you apologizing?

00:26:09.624 --> 00:26:12.169
Even before the photos
of you with Larkin were released,

00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:13.670
I had already seen them.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.145
My older brother was the
one who took those pictures.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:24.556
He said it would be big news

00:26:24.556 --> 00:26:26.558
and that he could
get a lot of money

00:26:26.558 --> 00:26:28.118
from Larkin’s management.

00:26:28.143 --> 00:26:31.021
But the management blocked
my brother’s photos.

00:26:32.105 --> 00:26:34.441
They released pictures
of Clea and Larkin

00:26:34.441 --> 00:26:36.902
kissing at the same spot

00:26:36.902 --> 00:26:38.778
where you two were photographed.

00:26:40.363 --> 00:26:42.073
So they kissed...

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.744
just to cover up what was
going on with me and Arkin?

00:26:45.744 --> 00:26:46.745
Yes.

00:26:47.162 --> 00:26:48.497
But an issue suddenly blew up

00:26:48.497 --> 00:26:52.751
when the photo of you with Larkin
outside the school came out.

00:26:52.751 --> 00:26:54.628
That’s when my brother got the nerve

00:26:54.628 --> 00:26:56.505
to sell it to the media,

00:26:56.505 --> 00:26:58.298
which is why it became public.

00:26:59.007 --> 00:27:00.383
Sorry, Via.

00:27:00.383 --> 00:27:03.178
I really tried to stop my brother,

00:27:03.178 --> 00:27:06.223
but he didn’t listen, even
though I begged him.

00:27:06.556 --> 00:27:08.058
Sorry, Via.

00:27:08.058 --> 00:27:09.309
I’m sorry.

00:27:12.103 --> 00:27:13.104
No.

00:27:15.482 --> 00:27:16.191
Thank you.

00:27:16.191 --> 00:27:17.901
Thank you for telling me.

00:27:18.527 --> 00:27:19.903
Will you be okay?

00:27:26.085 --> 00:27:27.453
I’ll go ahead.

00:27:33.767 --> 00:27:35.018
Tell your sister,

00:27:35.043 --> 00:27:37.921
she has no right to ruin ArClea!

00:27:37.921 --> 00:27:38.880
Exactly!

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.006
Who does she think she is?

00:27:40.006 --> 00:27:41.758
Clea’s way prettier than her.

00:27:41.758 --> 00:27:43.552
My sister didn’t ruin anything.

00:27:43.552 --> 00:27:44.427
What do you mean?

00:27:44.427 --> 00:27:47.138
It’s all over social media that
your sister is a mistress.

00:27:47.639 --> 00:27:49.432
Disgusting side-chick.

00:27:49.432 --> 00:27:51.101
What did you just say?

00:27:51.768 --> 00:27:52.602
Mira!

00:27:52.602 --> 00:27:53.603
- Hey, what are you doing—
- Mira!

00:27:53.628 --> 00:27:55.547
Hey, stop it!

00:27:55.981 --> 00:27:57.107
- Mira, what are you doing?
- Oh my.

00:27:57.107 --> 00:27:58.400
Here’s the mistress.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.234
Hey, you!

00:27:59.234 --> 00:28:00.839
You put a love spell on Arkin, didn’t you?

00:28:00.864 --> 00:28:02.698
As if he’d ever like someone like you.

00:28:02.723 --> 00:28:04.864
- I’m prettier than you.
- What did you say?

00:28:04.864 --> 00:28:06.366
Hey! Mira!

00:28:06.366 --> 00:28:08.076
That’s enough, stop it already!

00:28:08.076 --> 00:28:10.870
Do you want me to report
you both to your teachers?

00:28:10.956 --> 00:28:12.541
I’ll have you sent
to your principal’s office!

00:28:13.246 --> 00:28:14.247
Come on, let’s go.

00:28:15.542 --> 00:28:17.002
Are you okay?

00:28:17.002 --> 00:28:18.114
Are you all right?

00:28:18.139 --> 00:28:19.432
How about you, Via?

00:28:19.896 --> 00:28:21.439
Are you okay?

00:28:21.793 --> 00:28:23.211
Yes, I’m fine.

00:28:23.523 --> 00:28:26.234
But Mira, don’t hurt other people.

00:28:26.508 --> 00:28:28.051
Don’t get into fights, okay?

00:28:28.834 --> 00:28:30.836
But Via, they’re hurting you, too.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.602
They’re saying all kinds
of things about you

00:28:33.602 --> 00:28:35.405
when they don’t even know you!

00:28:38.197 --> 00:28:40.449
I can’t just let them be, Via.

00:28:41.192 --> 00:28:43.862
Do they lock themselves
in their rooms every night?

00:28:44.404 --> 00:28:45.864
Are they not eating anymore?

00:28:46.901 --> 00:28:49.069
Do they cry themselves to sleep?

00:28:52.787 --> 00:28:54.331
That’s all you, Via.

00:28:55.707 --> 00:28:57.792
So how can I just let them be?

00:29:00.629 --> 00:29:03.465
It would feel like I’m
letting them hurt you.

00:29:07.927 --> 00:29:09.085
Mira.

00:29:12.223 --> 00:29:13.600
Mira, I’m sorry.

00:29:14.976 --> 00:29:17.520
I’m sorry. This is my fault.

00:29:17.979 --> 00:29:20.273
- I’m sorry—
- I’m getting really mad at Arkin.

00:29:22.192 --> 00:29:23.902
Why isn’t he by your side?

00:29:24.653 --> 00:29:26.196
Why isn’t he here?

00:29:26.668 --> 00:29:28.503
You need him, Via.

00:29:30.575 --> 00:29:33.036
Mira, it’s not Arkin’s fault
that he can’t be

00:29:33.036 --> 00:29:34.496
by my side right now.

00:29:34.954 --> 00:29:36.915
It’s just that he really can’t.

00:29:36.915 --> 00:29:39.668
People’s eyes are on him
too much at the moment.

00:29:39.959 --> 00:29:42.295
Do what other people
say really matter?

00:29:43.004 --> 00:29:45.048
Whatever they’re saying, Via…

00:29:47.394 --> 00:29:49.563
Is it more important than you?

00:29:52.847 --> 00:29:53.848
Mira—

00:29:55.728 --> 00:29:57.313
You’ll learn it someday.

00:29:57.769 --> 00:30:01.314
You’ll understand that
a person’s world

00:30:01.314 --> 00:30:03.358
doesn’t revolve
around love alone.

00:30:11.157 --> 00:30:12.158
Let’s go home…

00:30:41.521 --> 00:30:43.440
Poor Clea!
You should be ashamed,

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.317
Avianna, whoever you are.

00:30:46.568 --> 00:30:49.112
Cheaters and mistresses deserve to die!

00:30:49.112 --> 00:30:50.613
You’re disgusting, Via!

00:30:52.323 --> 00:30:54.826
Slut. Good thing your mom died.

00:31:15.972 --> 00:31:17.849
Via? It’s me.

00:31:19.476 --> 00:31:20.727
Via, how are you?

00:31:20.727 --> 00:31:22.228
How’s Mira? How’s everyone?

00:31:24.147 --> 00:31:25.607
What are you doing here?

00:31:26.649 --> 00:31:27.776
You can’t be here, Arkin.

00:31:27.776 --> 00:31:28.777
Someone might see you.

00:31:28.777 --> 00:31:30.028
You need to leave.

00:31:31.863 --> 00:31:33.072
Via, I’m sorry.

00:31:34.522 --> 00:31:35.784
I’m sorry.

00:31:35.784 --> 00:31:37.812
I’m sorry you all got
dragged into this.

00:31:38.622 --> 00:31:39.623
Via—

00:31:45.627 --> 00:31:47.045
I messed up.

00:31:57.138 --> 00:31:58.640
Via, I love you so much,

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.475
and that will never change, okay?

00:32:00.475 --> 00:32:01.601
No matter what happens,

00:32:01.601 --> 00:32:02.519
no matter how painful it gets,

00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:03.645
no matter how hard it is.

00:32:04.056 --> 00:32:05.516
I love you so much, Via.

00:32:11.194 --> 00:32:12.195
Via—

00:32:19.327 --> 00:32:20.328
Via.

00:32:21.287 --> 00:32:23.623
I don’t want to keep
doing this anymore.

00:32:29.504 --> 00:32:31.172
Can I just stay here?

00:32:32.603 --> 00:32:34.814
Can I not go back
there anymore, Via?

00:32:37.574 --> 00:32:39.284
You can’t, Arkin.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.018
You’re not allowed here anymore.

00:32:48.883 --> 00:32:52.261
If only I had known this
would all happen to you.

00:32:55.697 --> 00:32:59.868
I would never have entered
this damn industry.

00:33:05.748 --> 00:33:06.749
Via—

00:33:10.545 --> 00:33:12.422
How do I escape this?

00:33:12.714 --> 00:33:14.007
I’m tired of all this.

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:18.428
You can't.

00:33:21.764 --> 00:33:23.224
You have to face this.

00:33:26.102 --> 00:33:27.729
We’ll face it together.

00:33:30.227 --> 00:33:31.895
You won’t leave me?

00:33:52.431 --> 00:33:54.099
I won’t leave you.

00:33:56.279 --> 00:33:57.906
I’m not going anywhere.

00:34:57.091 --> 00:34:58.236
Clea?

00:35:00.154 --> 00:35:01.673
What are you doing here?

00:35:01.698 --> 00:35:02.490
Come inside first.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:03.591
No need.

00:35:03.616 --> 00:35:05.702
I’m quite embarrassed
to see your family.

00:35:07.203 --> 00:35:08.204
Can we talk?

00:35:16.921 --> 00:35:18.423
Are you breaking up with him?

00:35:26.556 --> 00:35:28.766
When I first found out that
Larkin was dating someone,

00:35:28.887 --> 00:35:30.097
I didn’t really care.

00:35:30.393 --> 00:35:32.334
That kind of thing is
normal in the industry.

00:35:32.729 --> 00:35:34.147
But I value my career.

00:35:34.689 --> 00:35:36.774
And if this issue will
affect me negatively,

00:35:37.483 --> 00:35:38.985
then I choose to step in.

00:35:42.947 --> 00:35:45.158
I’ve built my career
ever since I was a kid.

00:35:45.616 --> 00:35:47.869
I’ve endured a lot and worked
my way to the top.

00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:50.482
Do you see where I’m getting at?

00:35:53.666 --> 00:35:54.667
At first,

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.753
people were
already suspecting

00:35:56.753 --> 00:35:58.796
that Larkin was dating
someone off-camera

00:35:59.183 --> 00:36:01.477
And I did everything
to cover that up.

00:36:02.465 --> 00:36:04.552
He even asked me
to keep you away

00:36:04.552 --> 00:36:05.720
from the spotlight

00:36:05.928 --> 00:36:07.889
because of something
that happened in your past.

00:36:08.347 --> 00:36:09.474
And I did.

00:36:10.641 --> 00:36:13.561
I also warned you two to be careful

00:36:13.951 --> 00:36:15.535
about hiding your relationship.

00:36:16.268 --> 00:36:18.124
But now that everything’s
out in the open,

00:36:18.149 --> 00:36:19.400
Larkin wants to quit.

00:36:20.443 --> 00:36:21.611
But he can’t

00:36:21.784 --> 00:36:23.744
because we both
signed a contract.

00:36:28.659 --> 00:36:31.579
Was kissing him part of that contract?

00:36:32.663 --> 00:36:33.831
The photos?

00:36:34.916 --> 00:36:36.125
Don’t worry about that.

00:36:36.918 --> 00:36:38.118
We didn’t really kiss.

00:36:38.143 --> 00:36:39.978
We only made it
look like we did.

00:36:42.173 --> 00:36:43.174
Yes.

00:36:44.175 --> 00:36:45.176
Good job.

00:36:46.302 --> 00:36:47.303
Yes.

00:36:53.684 --> 00:36:55.478
He was even crying at that time.

00:36:59.982 --> 00:37:02.276
And I can see that you’ve
been crying for days, too.

00:37:03.027 --> 00:37:04.028
Just like him.

00:37:11.035 --> 00:37:12.065
Look,

00:37:12.667 --> 00:37:15.044
I know that Larkin is in
a tight spot right now.

00:37:15.915 --> 00:37:18.876
He feels like he has to choose
between you and his career.

00:37:20.216 --> 00:37:22.051
But he really doesn’t
have a choice

00:37:22.755 --> 00:37:24.423
since he’s tied to the contract.

00:37:26.384 --> 00:37:28.511
Now it’s up to you how
you want to handle this.

00:37:30.596 --> 00:37:32.390
So, going back to my question,

00:37:33.641 --> 00:37:35.393
are you going to
end things with him?

00:37:44.279 --> 00:37:45.280
I don’t…

00:37:46.028 --> 00:37:48.239
I don’t know yet. I just don’t know.

00:37:51.784 --> 00:37:54.196
You know all of this
won’t do him

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.013
or his career any good.

00:37:59.125 --> 00:38:01.210
And for my career,

00:38:03.254 --> 00:38:04.922
I won’t let anyone ruin it.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.575
Not Larkin.

00:38:09.179 --> 00:38:10.472
Not Adi.

00:38:11.857 --> 00:38:13.306
Not anyone.

00:38:26.944 --> 00:38:28.154
That’s my car.

00:38:28.654 --> 00:38:29.655
I’ll go now.

00:38:32.283 --> 00:38:33.298
Clea.

00:38:33.993 --> 00:38:34.994
Oh, Clea!

00:38:38.458 --> 00:38:39.459
Are you okay?

00:38:39.484 --> 00:38:41.278
I’m fine. Thank you.

00:38:41.597 --> 00:38:42.598
Thank you.

00:39:16.994 --> 00:39:18.120
Hey,

00:39:18.788 --> 00:39:21.791
I just wanted to
ask how you’ve been.

00:39:22.792 --> 00:39:24.210
How are you holding up?

00:39:24.585 --> 00:39:26.712
Is everything all right?

00:39:28.881 --> 00:39:31.342
Sam, it’s been really hard.

00:39:33.886 --> 00:39:35.680
I don’t want this.

00:39:36.764 --> 00:39:38.808
Sam, I don’t want this anymore.

00:39:38.933 --> 00:39:40.184
I know, love.

00:39:40.434 --> 00:39:41.894
You can cry.

00:39:41.894 --> 00:39:44.272
I’m sorry you’re
going through this.

00:39:44.272 --> 00:39:46.732
I’m also sorry I can’t
come to you right now.

00:39:46.732 --> 00:39:49.151
I’m not in the Philippines,

00:39:49.527 --> 00:39:52.905
but I’m willing to take the
next flight just to see you.

00:39:52.905 --> 00:39:55.449
I’ll come to you as
soon as my shoot is over.

00:39:55.449 --> 00:39:56.575
Sam, don’t.

00:39:57.994 --> 00:39:59.203
I’m okay.

00:40:00.663 --> 00:40:01.664
Don’t worry about me.

00:40:01.664 --> 00:40:04.292
I can handle this.
I’ll get through it.

00:40:06.168 --> 00:40:09.255
Via, you can’t handle
everything on your own.

00:40:09.255 --> 00:40:13.301
If it’s too heavy,
let us help carry it, okay?

00:40:13.926 --> 00:40:16.554
You don’t have to do this alone.

00:40:16.804 --> 00:40:18.514
You can always lean on me.

00:40:19.557 --> 00:40:22.310
My sister used to say,

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.729
you are more than what they say.

00:40:25.229 --> 00:40:26.731
So please don’t believe all the hate

00:40:26.731 --> 00:40:28.357
they’ve been throwing at you.

00:40:29.025 --> 00:40:31.277
I love you. We love you.

00:40:31.944 --> 00:40:35.573
And most importantly,
love yourself too.

00:40:36.798 --> 00:40:40.344
Via, it’s not wrong to
choose yourself this time.

00:40:40.661 --> 00:40:41.704
Thanks, Sam.

00:40:42.913 --> 00:40:46.542
- Thank you.
- I love you, Via. See you soon, okay?

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:50.421
Take care.

00:41:05.217 --> 00:41:06.344
Via.

00:41:06.854 --> 00:41:07.980
How are you?

00:41:09.582 --> 00:41:10.583
What are you doing here?

00:41:10.608 --> 00:41:11.609
What about Avi?

00:41:12.151 --> 00:41:13.778
Mama’s watching her.

00:41:14.862 --> 00:41:15.988
Let’s drink?

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:26.035
Cheers.

00:41:39.845 --> 00:41:41.430
You were just crying,
weren’t you?

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.511
Yanna, do you think
I can live without him?

00:41:56.105 --> 00:41:57.106
You can.

00:41:58.124 --> 00:41:59.751
We don’t really have a choice

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:04.328
but to learn how to deal
with it once they’re gone.

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:08.661
I hope so.

00:42:10.918 --> 00:42:12.586
I hope I can handle it.

00:42:14.463 --> 00:42:15.464
What about him?

00:42:16.924 --> 00:42:18.801
Do you think he can
manage without me?

00:42:21.512 --> 00:42:23.013
I hope he can, too, right?

00:42:25.724 --> 00:42:27.726
Because, Yanna, I’m leaving.

00:42:33.899 --> 00:42:36.026
Where are you going?

00:42:43.868 --> 00:42:44.994
To Spain.

00:42:47.853 --> 00:42:50.022
I’ll be working there with my aunt.

00:42:52.042 --> 00:42:53.752
I’m leaving as soon as...

00:42:55.129 --> 00:42:56.922
I pass the licensure exam.

00:42:58.215 --> 00:42:59.633
I haven’t told anyone else yet.

00:42:59.633 --> 00:43:01.177
You’re the first.

00:43:11.937 --> 00:43:13.522
Are you not coming back?

00:43:16.775 --> 00:43:18.277
I don’t know.

00:43:21.906 --> 00:43:25.284
I still don’t know what my plan is.

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:27.995
I don’t even know

00:43:29.236 --> 00:43:30.988
if I can come back.

00:43:32.833 --> 00:43:35.127
I don’t know if I can still stay here.

00:43:37.046 --> 00:43:39.507
It feels like everyone’s mad at me.

00:43:40.966 --> 00:43:43.677
It feels like
everyone’s saying that—

00:43:47.223 --> 00:43:48.724
that I’m a slut.

00:43:49.925 --> 00:43:51.760
They’re such assholes for saying that!

00:43:52.939 --> 00:43:55.734
No one really knows you except us!

00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:57.891
Shit!

00:43:58.648 --> 00:44:01.234
Who the hell are they
to have an opinion about you?

00:44:09.085 --> 00:44:11.379
We’re the ones
who know you, Via.

00:44:14.208 --> 00:44:16.126
And we know that’s not who you are.

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.131
Yanna, how do I look?

00:44:27.137 --> 00:44:28.639
You’re beautiful, Via.

00:44:32.393 --> 00:44:33.686
You really are.

00:44:35.104 --> 00:44:38.357
And you’re beautiful
on the inside, too,

00:44:38.357 --> 00:44:39.650
unlike them.

00:44:43.029 --> 00:44:46.532
As long as you know you
didn’t do anything wrong.

00:44:50.995 --> 00:44:52.830
Even if you ask any of us.

00:44:53.497 --> 00:44:55.040
Even Sevi.

00:44:59.878 --> 00:45:01.505
You’re beautiful, Via.

00:45:03.382 --> 00:45:05.342
And you have a good heart.

00:45:14.017 --> 00:45:16.436
You’re still my baby, Via.

00:45:17.311 --> 00:45:19.063
Go on, cry it all out.

00:45:19.481 --> 00:45:20.858
I’m right here.

00:45:21.942 --> 00:45:23.485
Everything will be okay.

00:45:24.945 --> 00:45:25.946
Okay?

00:45:36.037 --> 00:45:37.705
You want some water?

00:45:42.546 --> 00:45:43.547
Okay—

00:46:01.255 --> 00:46:02.840
It’s okay.

00:46:03.901 --> 00:46:05.527
Just let it all out.

00:46:06.667 --> 00:46:08.294
I’m not leaving you.

00:46:12.481 --> 00:46:14.358
OMG! I saw Clea
and Arkin’s side-chick

00:46:14.384 --> 00:46:16.874
in our subdivision yesterday.

00:46:16.899 --> 00:46:18.550
She was picking
a fight with Clea.

00:46:18.575 --> 00:46:20.086
It was crazy!

00:46:20.111 --> 00:46:21.840
Can’t believe how bold
they are these days!

00:46:21.865 --> 00:46:22.893
How dare she fight Clea!

00:46:22.893 --> 00:46:24.487
So that’s the
controversial student.

00:46:24.512 --> 00:46:25.520
I used to think
she was innocent

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.771
Turns out she’s got
a lot going on underneath.

00:46:26.771 --> 00:46:28.273
She’s not even pretty, yet
she’s got so much nerve!

00:46:28.273 --> 00:46:29.460
- What did Arkin even see in that girl?
- An ugly mistress.

00:46:29.485 --> 00:46:31.153
She doesn’t deserve
someone like Larkin Sanchez!

00:46:31.178 --> 00:46:33.523
Honestly, I think Arkin just
wasted his career over that woman.

00:46:33.778 --> 00:46:34.863
I really think this is the spot.

00:46:34.863 --> 00:46:35.947
- Where?
- Where?

00:46:35.947 --> 00:46:38.825
Yeah. This is it. This is
where she fought with Clea.

00:46:38.825 --> 00:46:40.619
- Yeah, I’m sure.
- Are you sure?

00:46:40.619 --> 00:46:41.912
- Really?
- Where?

00:46:41.912 --> 00:46:44.431
Right here! This subdivision.

00:46:44.456 --> 00:46:45.874
- There she is!
- There she is.

00:46:46.619 --> 00:46:48.246
- Oh, so that’s her.
- There she is!

00:46:49.169 --> 00:46:50.837
Hi, side-chick.

00:46:50.837 --> 00:46:51.588
Hi.

00:46:51.588 --> 00:46:52.797
Hey, bitch!

00:46:52.797 --> 00:46:53.982
You slut!

00:46:54.007 --> 00:46:56.051
You really went after Clea, huh?

00:46:56.301 --> 00:46:57.844
Exactly. She thinks she’s
pretty or something.

00:46:57.844 --> 00:46:58.637
- You’ve got some nerve.
- You’re just a side-chick!

00:46:58.637 --> 00:46:59.804
- A whore!
- Slut!

00:47:00.299 --> 00:47:01.717
You think you’re pretty?

00:47:02.246 --> 00:47:04.081
- You’re ugly!
- You’re such a slut.

00:47:04.142 --> 00:47:05.823
You’re a whore!

00:47:05.848 --> 00:47:07.558
- How dare you!
- Side-chick!

00:47:07.604 --> 00:47:09.230
You’re going too far.

00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:11.942
- Slut!
- You’re ugly!

00:47:13.652 --> 00:47:14.861
That’s enough—

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:15.952
Via!

00:47:17.572 --> 00:47:19.240
Please stop!
Please stop!

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:21.701
Stop it already!

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:24.454
Don’t!

00:47:24.454 --> 00:47:26.122
Not my siblings!

00:47:26.122 --> 00:47:29.626
I stayed away from
the spotlight, from music,

00:47:29.747 --> 00:47:32.073
because I didn’t want
to end up like Mama.

00:47:32.687 --> 00:47:34.063
But why…

00:47:34.697 --> 00:47:36.490
Why is this happening?

00:47:37.008 --> 00:47:38.010
Stop it!

00:48:19.533 --> 00:48:20.534
Arkin.

00:48:20.559 --> 00:48:21.977
Is it okay that you’re here?

00:48:22.914 --> 00:48:24.035
Pa.

00:48:25.489 --> 00:48:27.574
I snuck away from
my driver and manager, Pa.

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:30.440
I just wanted to talk to Via.

00:48:30.465 --> 00:48:31.543
How is she?

00:48:32.439 --> 00:48:33.606
She’s already asleep upstairs.

00:48:33.606 --> 00:48:34.899
She has a high fever.

00:48:36.351 --> 00:48:37.977
I’ll go check on Via, Pa.

00:48:38.394 --> 00:48:39.395
Arkin,

00:48:40.405 --> 00:48:41.740
I know you don’t
have control over

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.074
what’s happening right now.

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:47.233
But it really hurts to see
Via crying every night.

00:48:49.844 --> 00:48:50.970
What do we do about this?

00:48:51.891 --> 00:48:54.477
How do we even find a solution?

00:48:55.369 --> 00:48:57.579
I hate seeing my daughter suffer.

00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:01.110
Pa, I’m sorry.

00:49:03.062 --> 00:49:04.397
I’m really sorry, Pa.

00:49:07.308 --> 00:49:10.103
But I’ll do everything to
make sure Via’s gonna be okay.

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:12.433
I promise.

00:49:47.931 --> 00:49:49.432
I love you so much,

00:49:50.558 --> 00:49:53.019
and I’m ready to give up
everything for you.

00:50:14.457 --> 00:50:15.625
Where are you?

00:50:17.043 --> 00:50:18.586
We need to talk.

00:50:22.507 --> 00:50:23.508
Via?

00:50:23.508 --> 00:50:25.218
Can we still make this work?

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:27.095
I can.

00:50:27.679 --> 00:50:29.097
My family

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:31.558
is also getting dragged into this.

00:50:31.558 --> 00:50:33.643
You should just
focus on your career.

00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:38.481
Maybe that’s why
I never had big dreams.

00:50:39.315 --> 00:50:42.068
Because I’m scared
that I might lose something

00:50:42.068 --> 00:50:44.946
while I’m busy
chasing those dreams.

00:50:47.031 --> 00:50:48.324
To answer your question,

00:50:48.324 --> 00:50:50.618
the woman in the photo
is my childhood friend.

00:50:50.785 --> 00:50:52.412
So, we’ve been close
for a long time.

00:50:52.437 --> 00:50:54.063
So, we’ve been close
for a long time.

00:50:56.214 --> 00:50:57.716
There were times when
I really wanted to say

00:50:57.741 --> 00:50:59.868
that I wish we had never met.
