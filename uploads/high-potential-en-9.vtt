Victim's name is Curtis Behr,
ex-con, armed robbery, multiple assaults.

Hiker's spotted the truck and called
it in. Dawson's getting their statements.

[Karadec] Any idea
what the guy was doing out here?

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:50.439
Well, we have some thoughts.
Here's what we found in the truck.

-That's a down payment.

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:09.624
Half of 7,500, a quarter of 15 grand.

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:11.543
Buy everything on layaway,
you get good at that math too.

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:13.170

Hmm. "Balance upon completion.
And I'm watching you so I'll know."

It certainly feels
like Mr. Behr was hired to do a hit.

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.428
The question is, did he finish the job?

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:23.805
Are you saying there might
be another victim out here?

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.140
Right.

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:28.852
That is a lot of ground to cover
to hunt for a body that might not exist.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.438
Well, just means we need
to narrow our search.

Seeing a lot of orange golf balls around
here and some of them are brand new.

to be exposed to the elements yet.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.199
-Like someone was hitting this morning.
-Mm-hmm.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.075
Okay, so our golfer
might be Behr's subject,

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:46.453
but even so, these balls
could have been hit from anywhere.

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:47.662
Well, that's not true.

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:51.124
The path that a golf ball takes
and the distance are completely related.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:55.378
When a golfer slices the ball
and it goes away from his body,

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:57.756
it has less energy
and travels a shorter distance

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.466
than if you were to hit it straight.

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:00.759
[crowd gasps]

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.513
If a golfer hooks the ball,
it goes across his body,

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:06.473
has more energy, and goes further.

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:08.767

[grunts]

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:14.231
So, all we have to do is look at the
spread of where these golf balls landed,

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.857
and that way we can work backwards

00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:19.110

where they came from.

"Do it best or don't do it at all"?

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.938
His name is Douglas Newmeyer.
He invented the Newmeyer Sweep.

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.357
I've used that vacuum,
I absolutely hate it.

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:10.073
That thing is way too powerful.
It should come with a warning label.

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:12.117
[scoffs] That label would be interesting.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.453
Yeah, the Newmeyer Sweep was implicated
in over a dozen home fires last year,

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:16.996
traced back to faulty wiring.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.125
Well, vacuum cleaners are full of lint,
so when they go up they go up fast.

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:22.377
Four severe injuries, four deaths.

Oh, my God.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.921
That is terrible.

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:28.049
Newmeyer was accused
of knowing the vacuum could catch fire,

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.009
burying it and keeping it
in stores anyway.

00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:31.302
How did I not hear about this?

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:35.724
Newmeyer's lawyers got gag orders imposed,
so as not to taint a potential jury.

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:37.642
For the most part,
it stayed out of the press.

And hiring pro security,

00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.664
[Oz] You think one
of those bodyguards did their job

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.668
I think we can take Newmeyer
and his goons off the table.

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:05.754
If one of them killed Behr,
they wouldn't have left evidence

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:10.925
regardless of who killed the hit man.

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.260
His life is still in danger.

00:09:12.343 --> 00:09:13.887
Got it. Let's do it.

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:15.555
[Karadec] I'm surprised.

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.766
I was expecting you
to have a problem protecting this guy.

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:19.225
You can protect him if you want.

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:21.603
I wanna find him because he killed
four people and should rot in jail.

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:24.981
As long as we keep Newmeyer safe
and find whoever killed Behr.

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:27.442
Daphne and Oz,
go talk to the victims' families,

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.611
see if anybody pops out
as having hired a hit man.

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:30.945
-[Oz] Yeah.
-Morgan and Karadec--

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:32.822
Go find the genius inventor
with multiple houses

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:34.115
who does not want to be found.

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:37.786
[Selena] Morgan, a word.

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:41.456
Is this about Arthur?

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:44.084
Not much to report,
but I wanted to keep you updated.

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:46.127
Forensics finished processing the truck.

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:50.673
No prints besides his own.
No blood or signs of struggle.

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:53.510
So, maybe he wasn't hurt.
At least not there.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.720
We're giving it 24 hours
to see if he turns up.

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:58.181
After that, it goes to Missing Persons.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:01.434
-Ugh. [sighs]
-We're doing everything we can.

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.646
You good to stay focused on this case?

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:08.650
-Yeah.
-Go to work.

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:14.072
-Hey, everything all right?
-Yep.

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:16.658
Figured I'd reach out
to Newmeyer's company,

00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:19.035
see if someone over there
can tell us where he's holed up.

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.871
Oh. You could do that, but it's in Berlin.
It's the middle of the night right now.

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:23.790
It's going to be a while
before we hear back.

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:26.251
And you've already thought
of a quicker way to find him, haven't you?

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:29.087
There's something I noticed
up on those trails.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:33.633
All of the sets of footprints from
both bodyguards were this brand, Volkner.

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:36.136
I looked it up.
It's a German military supplier.

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:39.264
I mean, one bodyguard wearing
German army boots could be anything--

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:42.475
But both of them wearing them,
you're thinking they're former military.

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:44.394
Newmeyer's company is based in Germany.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:46.980
Makes sense he'd hire
a security firm he already knew.

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:49.941
So, we find a firm
with offices in both LA and Berlin--

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:51.442
And you find Newmeyer.

You cannot be here.

-[Karadec] LAPD.
-Where are they going?

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:49.500
We need a word with Mr. Newmeyer.
We believe he may be in danger.

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:51.961
You can't go in there right now.
He's about to have his--

Who the hell are you?

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.274
-[person] Guard!
-[officer] FBI! Lower your weapons.

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:15.777
[Karadec] You need to put your guns down.
Put your guns down.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.654
-Hey, hey, hey.
-[Karadec] Put it down!

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.072
-Lower your weapon!
-Okay, okay.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.282
Hey, everybody, calm down! Calm down.

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.576
We're all calm, all right.

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:25.411
Look.

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:33.419
You care to explain
what the hell you're doing here?

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:35.171
You stepped in our op, you first.

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:37.507
We're investigating the death of a hit man

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.676
for hire who we believe
was targeting this man.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.223
[sighs]

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:48.226
-What?
-He's not a hit man for hire.

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:52.021
He was one of ours, posing as one.

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:54.357
What?

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.110
Our murder victim, he's an undercover fed.

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:09.247
[Daphne] Behr wasn't a killer for hire.
He was FBI.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.000
Fake hit man,
sounds like a bad action movie.

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:14.919
-You know, it gets results though.
-Are those results Jason Statham?

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:17.797
Someone wants someone dead, they think
they've hired a cold-blooded pro,

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.590
but in reality they've hired
an undercover fed.

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:21.301
All the stuff the agents were doing,

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:24.012
Behr's notes,
the photos faking that Newmeyer was dead,

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:26.806
all tricks the FBI uses
to build a case against the client.

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:30.393
Undercover wears a wire, shows the clients
the photos proving he's finished the job.

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:33.146
Client pays up and they get him
on tape saying the money is for murder.

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:35.356
So, no Jason Statham?

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.317
-Are you the group from LAPD?
-[Karadec] Yes, we are.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.570
Special Agent Myra Taylor.
Case manager on the Newmeyer op.

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.655

Hi, Myra.

00:13:55.626 --> 00:13:59.047
Agent Taylor and I worked a task force
back when I was undercover,

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.508
so when Major Crime stepped into their op,
she called me directly.

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:03.718
This way.

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:08.306
-You worked undercover?
-Can't tell you all my secrets.

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:10.433
We're over here.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:16.689
Oh, good. Now we can get started.

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:18.816

Something funny?

00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:28.201
Uh, no. It's just a lot of initials.
They're very important.

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:32.038
-And you are…
-Morgan Gillory, A-B-C-D-E-F-G.

00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:34.791
Ms. Gillory works with us as a consultant.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.001
She has some issues
with this investigation.

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:38.628
To be clear, I don't have any issues

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:40.129
with finding the guy
who killed your agent.

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:42.381
I'm just thinking as long as we're here,

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:45.218
you know, maybe we could
take down the rich murderer too.

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:46.761
[Wayne] Well, that's not why we're here,

00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:51.390
so let's keep our extra credit project
to ourselves.

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:52.475
Taylor.

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:56.104
The man you thought was a hit man,
Curtis Behr,

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:58.106
was really named Curtis Belanger,

00:14:58.189 --> 00:15:00.733
decorated undercover
out of the Denver Field Office.

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:03.486
Two FBI stars, that's our Purple Heart,

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:06.948
one Medal of Valor
for risking his life saving other agents.

00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:09.534
Left behind a wife and a little boy.

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:11.869
How could you not know
he was dead until we told you?

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:14.288
[Myra] His next check-in wasn't
until tomorrow.

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:16.207
You guys found him before we did.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.959
None of us knew Belanger well.

00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:20.044
Murder-for-hire guys are specialists.

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:21.587
He flew in just for this case.

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:24.257
He was living out of a motel
for the duration of the op.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.716
When was his last check-in?

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.720
The client left payment and a note
saying he was watching Belanger.

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:33.141
It could be he saw him at your last
check-in and made Belanger for a fed.

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:34.225
[Wayne] Exactly our theory.

00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:38.521
Then, fearing Belanger was onto him, the
guy killed Belanger to cover his tracks.

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:40.648
Wait, the guy?
You don't know who hired him?

00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:44.527
Initial contact came across a hit man for
hire site that was actually an FBI front.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:48.698
Client logged in using a fake ID. The
bureau subpoenaed the Internet provider,

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:50.741
but so far the company's fighting it.

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:54.162
Belanger had been steering the client
toward in-person meetings,

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:58.291
but so far they've insisted on dead drops
to exchange instructions and money.

00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:02.170
Short of it is, we're still working
on ID'ing the person who hired Belanger.

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:05.715
First focus had been the people who have
issued death threats against Newmeyer.

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:06.966
Okay.

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:09.969
Detective Ozdil can stay here, you can go
over those death threats with him.

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:12.847
Daphne and I can go to Newmeyer's house
to see if we can dig around

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.390
and find out who might want him dead.

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:17.268
This wouldn't just be
about your extra credit project, would it?

00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:19.103
I'm an incredible multitasker.

00:16:20.021 --> 00:16:22.523
Detective Karadec and I will go
to Belanger's motel room.

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:25.318
If someone made him,
could be an indication of it there.

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:46.214
My whole life is in here,
my calendars, all my contacts, my emails.

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:49.425
-Anything I can do to help, say the word.
-Thanks.

00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:50.927
[Morgan] You could confess…

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:54.931
that you knew your vacuums were dangerous.

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.224
That way you could be in prison

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:58.643
and that's a lot safer
than being out here, right?

00:16:58.726 --> 00:16:59.936
Feels like a win-win to me.

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:01.896
You're the consultant.

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:05.858
I was told you have a singular mind.

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:07.360
You're not what I expected.

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:09.320
[chuckles] Yeah, I hear that a lot.

00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:12.198
You, on the other hand,
are exactly what I expected.

00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:16.327
That's Uppsala, Sweden.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.871
I taught engineering
at Uppsala University.

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:21.082
It's known as the Oxford
of Northern Europe.

00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:23.251
-Real Oxford didn't want you?
-Morgan…

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:26.003
I'll be upstairs, if you need me.

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:31.884
Gonna clean up the blood on the floor?

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:34.804
Esmeralda will get it.

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:36.138
She's in tomorrow.

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:40.184
So, the guy who got rich making vacuum
cleaners doesn't clean up after himself?

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:41.435
Great, real good, got it.

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:43.104
[Daphne] Well,
we don't have to like the guy.

00:17:43.187 --> 00:17:44.981
We just need to figure out
who wants him dead.

00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:48.276
Well, good luck with that.
Bet anybody who knows him wants him dead.

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:50.736
Haven't met Esmeralda,
but I guarantee she does.

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:54.198
-Where you going?
-To snoop.

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:56.033
You know where we're not gonna find
anything helpful?

00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:57.952
In that laptop, because he gave it to us.

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.706
-Is the study this way?
-Mm-hmm. Yes, ma'am.

00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:12.967
Motel manager said
Belanger kept to himself.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.720
Didn't notice anyone suspicious
hanging around, guests either.

00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:17.805
But that's not saying much.
This place gets rapid turnaround.

00:18:17.888 --> 00:18:19.515
You looking for anything in particular?

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:24.020
Belanger's stash, someplace he'd hide
his casework, his notes, service weapon.

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:26.897
Okay, so we're looking for a place
that someone wouldn't find easily,

00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:29.066
but that Belanger could get to quickly.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.318
Exactly.

00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:31.694
I've lived out of rooms like this.

00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:34.155
If Belanger thought
somebody was onto him,

00:18:34.238 --> 00:18:36.365
most likely the place
we'll find proof of it is in there.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:37.533
[Karadec] Mm-hmm.

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:42.913
So, where did you work undercover?

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:48.252
Oakland mostly, lived up there
during my running from my family phase.

00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:49.962
I didn't know you had one of those.

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.255
Hasn't everyone?

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:55.426
[Karadec clears throat]

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:59.180
Sir, I'm guessing you had a reason
for this little team up.

00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:03.809
If you got a question to ask, just ask.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.773
Remember our chat recently
about keeping me in the loop?

00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:10.399
How can I forget?

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.568
Well, maybe you can help me with that.

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:13.778
With what?

00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:16.113
Twenty million dollar painting disappears,

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:20.034
right at the same time
as your partner goes AWOL for a few hours.

00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:22.495
I contacted
that art consultant afterwards,

00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:26.457
a guy Morgan seemed unusually chummy with.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:31.420
And who, up until that point, would stop
at nothing to recover that painting.

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:35.007
Then suddenly considers the case closed.

00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:36.133
I don't know.

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:38.803
You tell me, detective,
what am I supposed to think?

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:42.098
Everything I know is contained
in my report, sir.

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:44.642
Beyond that,
you can think whatever you want to think.

00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:48.396
[sighs] If you're covering for her,
be very careful.

00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:49.855
If I'm covering for my partner, sir,

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:53.359
it would seem to me that either you
should approve or you're a hypocrite.

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:11.335
Found it.

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:21.429
[grunting]

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:23.764
Ah. Nice.

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:28.060
-Hey, buddy.
-You know what I'm thinking?

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:31.147
Uh, almost never, but that's part
of what I love about you.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.565
You and Mom deserve a night off.

00:20:32.648 --> 00:20:35.860
When was the last time you went
to the movies or tried a new restaurant?

00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:37.987
Wow, that's really thoughtful, Elliot.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.905
Thanks, but we get our breaks in.

00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:42.783
You know, I hang with you guys
while Mom does her thing and vice versa.

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:44.285
No, I mean together.

00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:47.121
Why would we hang together?

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:51.125
Come sit down. I think you should do
something nice for her.

00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:52.710
Well, I got good news for you.

00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:54.712
I'm currently in the middle
of fixing her sink.

00:20:56.005 --> 00:20:58.716
-Is romance dead?
-I'm sorry, what are we talking about?

00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:01.218
-Do you not see what's going on here?
-I guess I don't.

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:04.472
The gauntlet's been thrown. I can't help
you if you're not even gonna try.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.364
-Any progress?
-[Morgan] Yeah, lots.

00:21:22.448 --> 00:21:25.910
First, I went through all the files
in your study, mostly boring, but I did…

00:21:25.993 --> 00:21:27.161
I did find out one thing.

00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:30.414
You know that charitable foundation
that all these awards came from?

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:31.999
He owns that.

00:21:32.082 --> 00:21:34.084
And he just moves money
from one of his bank accounts

00:21:34.168 --> 00:21:37.213
into another one of his bank accounts
and he gives himself awards for it.

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:38.589
[chuckles mockingly]

00:21:38.672 --> 00:21:41.217
Anyway, ever since then
I've just been looking through these files

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.804
that the FBI gave us about a faulty
vacuum cleaner that kills people.

00:21:44.887 --> 00:21:47.640
I meant in identifying
who hired a hit man to kill me.

00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:49.725
Yeah, don't you think
those two are connected?

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:50.976
You know what's crazy?

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.522
The only reason you're not in prison
is because of a lucky break.

00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:55.689
You gotta check this out.

00:21:55.773 --> 00:22:00.110
The feds had a letter to Newmeyer
from his own factory warning him

00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:01.612
that the wiring wasn't safe.

00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:03.572
You knew your vacuum was a time bomb.

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:07.368
These matters are highly technical.
It's far more complicated than you think.

00:22:08.369 --> 00:22:09.370
Is it?

00:22:09.453 --> 00:22:12.998
You cut corners to save money,
wires were installed improperly.

00:22:13.082 --> 00:22:15.876
The vacuum vibrates, wires shake loose…

00:22:18.587 --> 00:22:20.047
vacuum goes up in flames.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:21.382
Not complicated.

00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:24.260
All manufacturing demands
that we balance costs.

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:26.971
And no product is 100% safe.

00:22:27.054 --> 00:22:29.640
If you think otherwise, you're naive.

00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:32.726
Yeah, it's so childish of me to think

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.020
that a home appliance
shouldn't kill people.

00:22:35.813 --> 00:22:37.481
[sighs]

00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:39.149
[scoffs]

00:22:39.692 --> 00:22:40.901
I've seen your type before.

00:22:40.985 --> 00:22:42.361
And I've seen yours.

00:22:42.444 --> 00:22:44.697
All that intellect, wasted.

00:22:46.073 --> 00:22:50.077
And this… this chaos act that you put on
that you pretend is a choice,

00:22:50.578 --> 00:22:54.790
it's all a cover to hide that you can't
apply yourself even if you wanted to

00:22:54.874 --> 00:22:57.001
because you lack self-discipline.

00:22:58.043 --> 00:23:00.629
It's the real reason
you've accomplished nothing.

00:23:02.756 --> 00:23:04.008
And you never will.

00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:11.181
Well, no one's died because of me.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.560
That's an accomplishment, I guess.

00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:18.689
[phone buzzes]

00:23:20.316 --> 00:23:21.442
Excuse me.

00:23:28.198 --> 00:23:30.910
-Hi, everything okay?
-[Ludo] Everyone's fine,

00:23:30.993 --> 00:23:33.245
-health and safety wise.
-But?

00:23:33.329 --> 00:23:35.664
But we're having some big feelings
over here.

00:23:35.748 --> 00:23:38.000
Elliot is upset about the flowers.

00:23:38.584 --> 00:23:41.337
The flowers Rhys sent me? Why?
He doesn't even know Rhys.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.088
It's not about who did send them.

00:23:43.172 --> 00:23:44.548
It's about who didn't.

00:23:44.632 --> 00:23:47.009
He's upset that they didn't come from me.

00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:48.886
I think the kid is still holding out hope

00:23:48.969 --> 00:23:51.639
that his mom and dad
are going to get back together.

00:23:51.722 --> 00:23:54.016
[sighs] He said that?

00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:55.267
In as many words.

00:23:55.351 --> 00:23:56.477
Well, what'd you say?

00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.105
I didn't say anything. I wanted to talk
to you first and see what you told him.

00:24:00.689 --> 00:24:02.232
I mean, I told them both everything

00:24:02.316 --> 00:24:04.485
but that was a long time
ago back when we split up.

00:24:04.568 --> 00:24:05.945
Right.

00:24:06.946 --> 00:24:09.698
[sighs] Okay, why don't you wait till I
get home and then we can sit him down.

00:24:09.782 --> 00:24:11.867
-We'll figure out what's going on.
-No, no, no. It's okay.

00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:14.161
We're in this together. I can talk to him.

00:24:14.244 --> 00:24:16.664
Okay, I know you'll know what to say.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:20.000
-I'll let you know how it goes.
-Call me if you need me.

00:24:30.928 --> 00:24:34.723
Hey, genius,
do you have any recent surgical scars?

00:24:34.807 --> 00:24:37.309
No. Why?

00:24:37.893 --> 00:24:41.271
'Cause she does. And she left
her scar cream in your bathroom.

00:24:41.355 --> 00:24:44.316
Yeah, I noticed earlier that you had
your hand around her waist.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.987
It's a little too intimate but it wouldn't
surprise me if you were the handsy type.

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:51.949
But I also noticed
that she's got a UV protective scarf

00:24:52.032 --> 00:24:54.201
and I don't think
she's worried about tan lines.

00:24:54.284 --> 00:24:58.539
I think she's trying
to keep this scar from darkening.

00:24:59.123 --> 00:25:01.583
-You're thinking thyroid surgery?
-I don't know, tough to say.

00:25:01.667 --> 00:25:04.837
But what I'm more interested in is the
fact that she's wearing a wedding ring.

00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:08.048
Did you bother telling the people
who are trying to save your life

00:25:08.132 --> 00:25:10.175
that you're having an affair
with a married woman?

00:25:10.259 --> 00:25:13.262
-Why not?
-I didn't think it was relevant.

00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:17.099
Her husband is a… [scoffs]…
a feeble man. Incapable of action.

00:25:17.808 --> 00:25:21.186
The kind of guy who hires a hit man
to do his dirty work.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.232
-I'm impressed.
-Oh, my God, you moron.

00:25:25.315 --> 00:25:28.360
Hey, what's this woman's name
and who's her husband?

00:25:29.278 --> 00:25:30.612
[sighs]

00:25:31.155 --> 00:25:34.116
Husband's name is Joel Dorskind, 48,
Beverly Hills, CPA.

00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:36.702
As far as we can tell, the guy
never stepped out of line in his life,

00:25:36.785 --> 00:25:38.746
not even a speeding ticket. Literally.

00:25:38.829 --> 00:25:41.707
Which explains why Newmeyer
never even considered him an option.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.292
Well, that and Newmeyer's arrogance.

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:46.128
If this Dorskind's such a Boy Scout,
why do we think he's our guy?

00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:48.505
Our detectives pulled surveillance video

00:25:48.589 --> 00:25:50.632
from an office supply store
five blocks from his firm.

00:25:50.716 --> 00:25:53.093
Same exact envelope
the client used to pay Belanger.

00:25:53.177 --> 00:25:55.137
Off that,
we got the Internet provider to play ball

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.639
and help us identify the person
who logged on to your website.

00:25:57.723 --> 00:25:59.641
Dorskind hired Belanger. He's our guy.

00:25:59.725 --> 00:26:01.060
Where's Dorskind now?

00:26:01.143 --> 00:26:03.562
At his office. Detective Forrester
is getting in front of a judge now.

00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:05.355
We should have a signed warrant in ten.

00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:08.275
Go get him.

00:26:19.161 --> 00:26:22.498
[Myra] FBI! Everyone,
hands where we can see them.

00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:26.085
LAPD, we have a warrant
for the arrest of Joel Dorskind.

00:26:26.168 --> 00:26:27.711
Where's Joel Dorskind?

00:26:30.005 --> 00:26:31.090
[door opens]

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:34.510
Dorskind, freeze!

00:26:43.102 --> 00:26:44.645
-[Daphne exclaims]
-[grunts, groans]

00:26:46.188 --> 00:26:47.940
Joel Dorskind.

00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:50.943
You have the right to remain silent.
Get up.

00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:53.112
[groans]

00:26:53.195 --> 00:26:56.824
Wait, wait, I didn't do anything
wrong yet. I…I could still call it off.

00:26:57.366 --> 00:26:59.118
-Wait, what?
-What can you call off?

00:26:59.201 --> 00:27:01.745
The hit man, he hasn't killed anybody yet.

00:27:01.829 --> 00:27:02.996
It's not too late.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.332
Karadec. In here.

00:27:12.714 --> 00:27:15.008
Dorskind was in here
putting together his next payment.

00:27:15.092 --> 00:27:16.885
He doesn't know his hit man's dead.

00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:19.721
So we have the guy who hired Belanger?

00:27:19.805 --> 00:27:21.723
But he's not the one who killed him.

00:27:36.405 --> 00:27:37.656
[Nick] Dorskind's not our guy.

00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:39.616
[Wayne] Or you just don't see it.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:43.036
Dorskind leaves a down payment
at his dead drop, goes on the website,

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.707
leaves instructions where to find it,
and watches whoever comes to pick it up.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.458
You think that guy wanted
to meet his killer?

00:27:48.542 --> 00:27:50.502
-Nicky.
-Myra, not now.

00:27:50.586 --> 00:27:55.007
Dorskind made Belanger for a fed.
His own notes said he was tailing him.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.384
And now that we've seen him,
I'd say that was posturing.

00:27:57.467 --> 00:27:59.303
Look, for what you're saying to work,

00:27:59.386 --> 00:28:01.763
Dorskind would have to have killed
an FBI agent

00:28:01.847 --> 00:28:05.976
and kept 11 grand in cash
lying around to throw on his desk

00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:09.438
so he could pretend he didn't know
anything if he got caught?

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:11.565
Makes sense to me.

00:28:11.648 --> 00:28:14.902
It's ridiculous. And now that
we've seen him, I'd say that was…

00:28:14.985 --> 00:28:18.196
You know, at some point you could
remind him he has his own office.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.198
What, and miss the show? [scoffs]

00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:24.828
I take it you've accepted
that Dorskind's not the killer.

00:28:24.912 --> 00:28:27.789
I'm going over the case from square one.
I'm looking for a new angle.

00:28:27.873 --> 00:28:30.876
Belanger had a whole jacket
before moving into murder-for-hire.

00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:34.171
He was embedded with drug traffickers,
gun runners,

00:28:34.254 --> 00:28:36.798
maybe some guy from an old case
decided to take him out.

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:40.010
What did the carpet look like
in Dorskind's office?

00:28:40.093 --> 00:28:41.303
Why do you ask?

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:43.347
Well, 'cause there's
some orange fibers on the envelope

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.849
that we found in Belanger's truck.

00:28:46.642 --> 00:28:49.895
But the fibers aren't on this
new envelope, just the one from the truck.

00:28:49.978 --> 00:28:52.314
The orange carpet was
in Belanger's motel room.

00:28:54.775 --> 00:28:57.402
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. Uh…

00:28:57.486 --> 00:28:59.780
His hiding place was
underneath the wardrobe against the floor.

00:28:59.863 --> 00:29:02.449
Those fibers got on everything. What?

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:06.370
If he'd already stashed
the money in his motel room,

00:29:06.453 --> 00:29:08.288
how did it end up back in his truck?

00:29:08.372 --> 00:29:10.415
Maybe he brought it along to vouch for it.

00:29:10.499 --> 00:29:12.834
No, his next check-in was tomorrow.

00:29:12.918 --> 00:29:14.836
He wouldn't have left
that much cash sitting in his truck.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.672
Well, if he didn't leave it in there,

00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:19.466
that means someone else took it
from the room and planted it in the truck.

00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:22.511
Because they wanted us
to focus on the murder-for-hire case

00:29:22.594 --> 00:29:25.514
and this note from Dorskind,
saying he was watching him.

00:29:25.597 --> 00:29:28.266
Dorskind didn't write that.
Whoever planted the money must have.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:32.312
That's not good. That means whoever
killed Belanger knew a lot of things.

00:29:33.146 --> 00:29:35.440
They knew about the undercover op
in the first place.

00:29:35.524 --> 00:29:38.485
They knew where to find him
while he was working it.

00:29:38.568 --> 00:29:40.862
[Oz] And they knew where he'd hide
that envelope in his room.

00:29:40.946 --> 00:29:43.907
-Which means?
-[Selena] Which means our killer…

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:47.869
could be one of the FBI agents
working the case.

00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:51.540
You two, pull everything you have
on the feds working the op.

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:55.085
Personnel files, case histories.
Are you in touch with your ex-partner?

00:29:55.168 --> 00:29:57.713
Ronnie's in D.C. right now,
but I'll tell him you're gonna reach out.

00:29:57.796 --> 00:29:59.464
-All right.
-Any of those agents had reason

00:29:59.548 --> 00:30:01.216
to kill Belanger,
we need to find out who.

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:02.968
And everyone keep it quiet.

00:30:09.891 --> 00:30:11.309
[knocks on door]

00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:14.813
Can I come in?

00:30:18.316 --> 00:30:21.403
Your mom getting flowers from another guy
kinda threw you for a loop, huh?

00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:27.325
You two aren't getting back together,
are you?

00:30:30.579 --> 00:30:33.123
It's probably not in the cards. No.

00:30:33.206 --> 00:30:35.292
Why not? You still like each other.

00:30:35.375 --> 00:30:38.378
We do. We do.
We like each other very much.

00:30:39.046 --> 00:30:41.923
And we still make a great team.
All of us do.

00:30:42.007 --> 00:30:46.011
This whole family makes a great team,
and that is never gonna change.

00:30:47.971 --> 00:30:52.267
But your mother and I realized
we didn't make a great couple.

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.729
And nobody did anything wrong.

00:30:56.813 --> 00:30:58.940
We just move at very different speeds.

00:30:59.983 --> 00:31:02.527
And trying to be people
we weren't. That… [sighs]

00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:05.447
It wasn't good for either of us.

00:31:07.491 --> 00:31:11.787
And we realized we work better as friends.

00:31:14.956 --> 00:31:15.957
I get that.

00:31:17.084 --> 00:31:18.210
You do?

00:31:19.628 --> 00:31:21.254
I want you guys to be happy.

00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:24.382
And I can handle it.

00:31:26.259 --> 00:31:28.553
Oh. Okay, great. [chuckles softly]

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.182
You know, that's really mature.

00:31:32.682 --> 00:31:34.476
-I try.
-[chuckles]

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:35.936
[sighs]

00:31:36.019 --> 00:31:38.814
-Do you need a hug?
-I need one so bad.

00:31:38.897 --> 00:31:39.981
Come here.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.527
-I love you, buddy.
-I love you.

00:31:48.323 --> 00:31:50.826
So, who did the breaking up, you or mom?

00:31:54.871 --> 00:31:55.956
How's it going?

00:31:56.039 --> 00:31:59.793
Honestly, it feels gross
investigating fellow officers.

00:31:59.876 --> 00:32:01.044
Yeah, I get that.

00:32:01.128 --> 00:32:03.046
Kinda hoping this angle doesn't pan out.

00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:17.853
Well, get ready to be disappointed.

00:32:19.479 --> 00:32:21.148
I think I just figured it out.

00:32:30.657 --> 00:32:32.367
[Morgan] What are you
doing up so early, buddy?

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.910
[Elliot] Check it out.

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:38.623
Look at this,
a working faucet just like normal people.

00:32:38.707 --> 00:32:40.917
-Dad and I fixed it together.
-Well, you're hired.

00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:42.502
[chuckles] And he showed me
what was wrong.

00:32:42.586 --> 00:32:45.964
Whoever lived here before us connected two
different types of metal and it corroded.

00:32:46.548 --> 00:32:48.842
So, you got a science lesson
crammed in there too, huh?

00:32:48.925 --> 00:32:51.178
-Yeah, dad's a smart guy.
-[chuckles]

00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:55.098
I hear you guys had a talk
about him and me.

00:32:56.349 --> 00:32:57.559
You okay?

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:59.936
Yeah. I think I just needed to hear it.

00:33:00.854 --> 00:33:02.189
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.942
And if something else pops up,
which it will, we'll talk about that too.

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:11.656
Actually, there's something else
I wanted to talk to you about.

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.241
We're back to plumbing, aren't we?

00:33:13.325 --> 00:33:14.492
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

00:33:14.576 --> 00:33:16.036
Can I show you another thing
dad taught me?

00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:17.120
-Absolutely.
-Okay.

00:33:17.204 --> 00:33:20.290
So, fluid dynamics are really interesting.
It's a whole subfield of physics.

00:33:20.373 --> 00:33:21.374
Mmm.

00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:24.544
Would it be weird
if I wanted to be a plumber?

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:27.797
Absolutely not.

00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:31.593
You keep that big heart of yours,
and you can be whatever you wanna be.

00:33:32.219 --> 00:33:33.553
'Kay.

00:33:33.637 --> 00:33:35.055
[chuckles]

00:33:44.397 --> 00:33:45.565
Mr. Newmeyer.

00:33:45.649 --> 00:33:48.151
Detective Karadec, LAPD.
You already know Ms. Gillory.

00:33:48.235 --> 00:33:49.236
What's up, Doug?

00:33:50.487 --> 00:33:52.822
I heard you arrested
Gabrielle Dorskind's husband,

00:33:52.906 --> 00:33:54.658
and he's the one who tried
to have me killed.

00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:56.785
That is true. We're still connecting
some of the dots though.

00:33:56.868 --> 00:33:58.370
Just wanted to walk you through it.

00:33:58.453 --> 00:34:00.247
Then Miss Gillory was right.

00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:02.290
She is unique.

00:34:02.374 --> 00:34:03.959
Well, we're keeping her around.

00:34:11.508 --> 00:34:14.844
Are you… You afraid of that vacuum?
I thought you said it was safe.

00:34:14.928 --> 00:34:17.305
Don't worry, Mr. Newmeyer,
no one's gonna send you to prison

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:19.349
for giving a vacuum cleaner a dirty look.

00:34:19.432 --> 00:34:20.892
[laughs] Oh, that's silly.

00:34:20.976 --> 00:34:23.603
We couldn't do that if we wanted to.
That's not even a thing.

00:34:23.687 --> 00:34:26.856
No, we're gonna send you
to prison for something else.

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:36.825
-You lied to me.
-Yeah.

00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:39.452
Police are allowed to do that.
You can check.

00:34:39.536 --> 00:34:42.789
Sit somewhere you can see the big screen,
we wouldn't want you to strain your neck.

00:34:47.502 --> 00:34:48.962
Now, we think you were told about these.

00:34:49.045 --> 00:34:52.507
Agent Belanger's surveillance shots of
you from when he was posing as a hit man.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.676
But you must not have known
all of the times

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:57.929
that Belanger was watching you,
otherwise he wouldn't have gotten this.

00:34:59.014 --> 00:35:02.183
[Karadec] These were on the memory card
we found in Belanger's motel room.

00:35:03.435 --> 00:35:07.647
To be more accurate, our techs restored
them from the deleted photos on the card.

00:35:10.317 --> 00:35:12.819
I guess you didn't know
Belanger's every move either.

00:35:12.902 --> 00:35:14.321
Maybe 'cause you're such a bad boss,

00:35:14.404 --> 00:35:16.364
your team didn't bother
keeping you in the loop.

00:35:16.448 --> 00:35:17.532
You were in Newmeyer's pocket.

00:35:17.616 --> 00:35:21.244
He wanted someone on the inside to keep
tabs on the investigation against him.

00:35:21.328 --> 00:35:23.246
And when he needed you to,
you stole evidence

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:24.873
to make sure the case would fall apart.

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:29.044
These photos came out or Belanger talked,
you were looking at serious jail time.

00:35:29.127 --> 00:35:30.670
I never met Agent Belanger,

00:35:30.754 --> 00:35:33.131
but I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for guys like him.

00:35:33.214 --> 00:35:36.259
And it's easy to imagine
when he stumbled onto you two meeting.

00:35:36.343 --> 00:35:39.304
He did you the courtesy
of giving you a chance to explain.

00:35:39.387 --> 00:35:41.139
And how did you repay that favor?

00:35:41.765 --> 00:35:44.934
Right. You broke into his motel room.

00:35:46.936 --> 00:35:50.690
And you deleted all of the photos
of yourself off his memory card.

00:35:51.358 --> 00:35:52.734
And then you killed him.

00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:08.333
You know, the funny thing is we never
would've looked for deleted photos

00:36:08.416 --> 00:36:11.002
until Morgan noticed an old assignment
in your personnel file.

00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:16.341
[Morgan] Uppsala, Sweden.

00:36:16.424 --> 00:36:18.301
Ugh, so beautiful.

00:36:18.385 --> 00:36:22.430
You know, I hear the school there
is the Oxford of Northern Europe.

00:36:22.514 --> 00:36:26.810
You were stationed there about ten years
ago tracking international hackers.

00:36:26.893 --> 00:36:29.979
Yeah, Newmeyer was there at the same time.
That's how you two met.

00:36:30.063 --> 00:36:31.773
You've got this all wrong.

00:36:32.273 --> 00:36:35.527
[scoffs] I had no idea
Agent Vincent killed a man.

00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:39.406
Yeah. I-I don't think that you're going
to be able to convince the jury of that.

00:36:39.489 --> 00:36:42.575
Yeah, we found a series
of bank transfers between you.

00:36:42.659 --> 00:36:44.869
Given the timing
of the most recent payment

00:36:44.953 --> 00:36:48.456
and the fact that it's a lot higher
than all the others,

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.500
it's pretty clear
you were in on the decision.

00:36:51.835 --> 00:36:55.505
You're both under arrest
for the murder of Agent Curtis Belanger.
