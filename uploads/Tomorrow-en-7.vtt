WEBVTT

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:26.877
Via… I have feelings for you.

00:00:27.356 --> 00:00:29.066
Maybe you’re just confused.

00:00:34.508 --> 00:00:35.843
This is better.

00:00:36.176 --> 00:00:39.304
So Arkin will realize he
doesn’t actually like me.

00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:41.807
Via, you look so beautiful.

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:46.687
Via, can we talk for a moment?

00:00:46.687 --> 00:00:48.313
What do you want to talk about?

00:00:48.313 --> 00:00:49.940
I never liked you at all.

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:53.402
So, are we good now?

00:00:57.072 --> 00:00:58.101
Yeah.

00:00:59.408 --> 00:01:01.243
I love you guys, too.

00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:04.329
Prom Night!

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.458
Our Prom King and Queen,

00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:10.669
Larkin Sanchez and Naya Madrigal!

00:01:13.922 --> 00:01:15.524
Now my first dance
is with someone else.

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.014
What do you want me to do?

00:01:17.593 --> 00:01:18.886
Dance with me now.

00:01:21.204 --> 00:01:23.332
How am I supposed
to get over this, Via?

00:02:39.758 --> 00:02:41.593
I was in the Music club for four years.

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.680
And I’ve been playing
music for a long time.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.598
And I’m happy
I got to meet all of you

00:02:46.598 --> 00:02:50.477
who love music the way I do.

00:02:51.728 --> 00:02:53.897
I hope you learned
something from me.

00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:56.358
Even if I’m not that
much of an expert.

00:02:56.358 --> 00:02:57.693
You did, right?

00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:02.948
I don’t know what path
I’ll take once I leave.

00:03:03.532 --> 00:03:06.743
I don’t know if my music
will take me anywhere.

00:03:07.744 --> 00:03:09.288
But there’s one thing I’m sure of.

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:12.374
All of you who are staying,

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:15.043
you still have so far to go.

00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:20.591
Thank you for the four years,
Music Club.

00:03:21.425 --> 00:03:22.551
I love you all.

00:03:24.553 --> 00:03:25.554
Yes!

00:03:27.222 --> 00:03:29.183
Thank you so much,
Vice President Arkin.

00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:31.602
So, time to eat?

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:34.980
- Let’s eat.
- Yes!

00:03:35.355 --> 00:03:36.815
Can I have some spaghetti?

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:38.400
Is their spaghetti good?

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.736
Hey, I haven’t written
a message on you yet.

00:03:40.736 --> 00:03:41.737
Come here.

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:43.030
Are you on a diet?

00:03:43.405 --> 00:03:44.406
You?

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.453
Okay! Thanks, take care, okay?

00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:52.372
Is the spaghetti good?

00:03:52.372 --> 00:03:53.582
I’ll eat this.

00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:55.042
Hey.

00:03:55.417 --> 00:03:56.418
What?

00:03:56.835 --> 00:03:59.922
Where am I supposed to write?
I don’t have any space left.

00:03:59.922 --> 00:04:02.424
Here. I left this space for you.

00:04:02.424 --> 00:04:04.051
- There. Right here.
- Really?

00:04:17.522 --> 00:04:18.537
There you go.

00:04:20.776 --> 00:04:21.777
Don’t read it yet!

00:04:22.486 --> 00:04:23.487
Later.

00:04:23.946 --> 00:04:24.963
Done?

00:04:24.988 --> 00:04:25.989
My turn?

00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:30.786
- Here.
- Here.

00:04:33.497 --> 00:04:34.498
Try the juice.

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:37.834
Write it well, okay?

00:04:53.475 --> 00:04:54.893
What are you writing?

00:04:55.185 --> 00:04:56.536
Are you scratching something out?

00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:57.904
Hey, you’re drawing, aren’t you?

00:04:58.814 --> 00:05:00.232
- Wait.
- Kino!

00:05:06.613 --> 00:05:07.614
We’ll look at it later.

00:05:08.156 --> 00:05:09.324
Huh? Why?

00:05:13.787 --> 00:05:15.414
- Are the results out now?
- Yeah.

00:05:22.212 --> 00:05:23.380
Let’s check at the same time?

00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:25.514
You first.

00:05:27.006 --> 00:05:28.014
Okay.

00:05:33.098 --> 00:05:34.099
Well, Kino?

00:05:34.683 --> 00:05:36.601
Via, I passed. Film.

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:38.979
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:05:39.354 --> 00:05:40.605
I told you.

00:05:40.605 --> 00:05:43.442
I told you you’d pass.
Congratulations!

00:05:43.567 --> 00:05:45.277
So what about you?
Did you pass, too?

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.275
Huh? I hope so.

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:07.174
You didn’t?

00:06:16.433 --> 00:06:17.768
Via, are you okay?

00:06:19.853 --> 00:06:20.771
Huh?

00:06:20.771 --> 00:06:21.772
Are you okay?

00:06:22.236 --> 00:06:23.404
Yeah, of course.

00:06:24.191 --> 00:06:25.692
I’ll study in España Boulevard.

00:06:26.276 --> 00:06:29.321
That’s fine.
I’ll be with Luna and Ke.

00:06:30.814 --> 00:06:31.815
Yeah.

00:06:32.115 --> 00:06:38.163
And it’s not like our future is trapped
in whatever university we get into, right?

00:06:38.163 --> 00:06:40.832
Our dreams aren’t
locked to one school.

00:06:40.832 --> 00:06:43.710
And I don’t even know
what my dream is yet.

00:06:44.468 --> 00:06:46.178
So, it’s okay.

00:06:48.086 --> 00:06:49.087
Right.

00:06:59.368 --> 00:07:00.786
Can you handle it, Via?

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:15.325
What about you, can you?

00:07:22.541 --> 00:07:24.334
Can you handle
not having me around?

00:07:24.584 --> 00:07:26.294
Can you handle not being with me?

00:07:30.882 --> 00:07:32.259
Of course.

00:07:32.592 --> 00:07:34.970
We can still meet after classes, right?

00:07:39.766 --> 00:07:40.767
Wow.

00:07:42.018 --> 00:07:44.229
You’ve really matured now.

00:07:45.188 --> 00:07:46.940
Before, you didn’t want
to be away from me.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.317
And now you can.

00:07:53.405 --> 00:07:54.906
Via, I can handle it.

00:07:55.365 --> 00:07:57.409
But I didn’t say I wanted to.

00:08:00.245 --> 00:08:02.038
But it’s fine, right?

00:08:03.582 --> 00:08:05.292
You’ll manage without me?

00:08:07.252 --> 00:08:10.464
And it doesn’t mean we’re
not friends anymore, right?

00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:52.172
Did you read what
I wrote on your uniform?

00:08:52.172 --> 00:08:53.199
Huh?

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.841
Oh, not yet.

00:08:55.074 --> 00:08:56.098
Not yet.

00:09:03.433 --> 00:09:04.976
I love you.

00:09:24.621 --> 00:09:25.872
I love you?

00:09:27.457 --> 00:09:28.708
You didn’t even
read the whole thing.

00:09:28.708 --> 00:09:30.210
There’s more, look. At the back.

00:09:30.418 --> 00:09:31.336
Huh?

00:09:31.545 --> 00:09:32.546
Where is it?

00:09:34.548 --> 00:09:36.174
As a friend.

00:09:39.719 --> 00:09:42.973
I didn’t read it, I didn’t notice it.

00:09:42.973 --> 00:09:44.391
I thought you scratched something out.

00:09:45.267 --> 00:09:49.145
Why is this happening?
I don’t get what I’m feeling.

00:09:49.312 --> 00:09:50.897
Am I disappointed?

00:09:51.106 --> 00:09:53.275
But why would I even be disappointed?

00:09:58.822 --> 00:09:59.823
Via…

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.495
Am I important to you?

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.753
You’re important to me, Kino.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:32.314
That’s why I’ll do everything I can
so nothing changes between us.

00:10:37.986 --> 00:10:41.698
What’s the first thing you want
to do when you’re in España?

00:10:44.034 --> 00:10:47.329
Try not to get lost?
The school’s huge, right?

00:10:58.298 --> 00:11:00.425
Here, sweetheart.
Be careful, okay?

00:11:00.467 --> 00:11:01.496
You got it?

00:11:04.179 --> 00:11:04.971
Here’s another one.

00:11:04.971 --> 00:11:06.139
Thank you.

00:11:25.408 --> 00:11:27.941
Mira, can you put this in Papa’s room?

00:11:28.713 --> 00:11:29.714
Thank you.

00:11:32.624 --> 00:11:33.629
Hey!

00:11:34.042 --> 00:11:35.877
Your new house is nice.

00:11:36.127 --> 00:11:40.548
There are a lot of eateries outside
and even a convenience store.

00:11:40.548 --> 00:11:42.592
And it’s so close to your university.

00:11:42.801 --> 00:11:44.969
Plus the jeepney terminal
is just around the corner.

00:11:45.512 --> 00:11:46.137
Right?

00:11:46.137 --> 00:11:46.846
It’s great.

00:11:46.846 --> 00:11:49.057
That’s exactly why we moved here.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.521
Remember this?

00:11:56.481 --> 00:11:58.400
We just came from their gig.

00:11:58.566 --> 00:12:00.402
We were so tired on the way home.

00:12:00.944 --> 00:12:02.779
They were so popular back then.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.243
Because of that fame, we lost her.

00:12:08.702 --> 00:12:09.707
Huh?

00:12:11.413 --> 00:12:12.488
What was that?

00:12:12.831 --> 00:12:13.640
Nothing.

00:12:13.665 --> 00:12:15.166
I said, are you having dinner here?

00:12:16.415 --> 00:12:17.541
Sure.

00:12:17.961 --> 00:12:19.921
But I probably
won’t sleep here later

00:12:20.505 --> 00:12:23.299
because Mom and I still aren’t
done moving my stuff to the condo.

00:12:23.633 --> 00:12:25.593
Oh yeah, right.

00:12:26.469 --> 00:12:29.305
If you want, I can help you
sort your things tomorrow.

00:12:29.305 --> 00:12:31.850
If that’s okay with you
and you’re not busy.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.393
Thank you in advance.

00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:37.063
Oh, right. Let me get
your things downstairs.

00:12:37.088 --> 00:12:38.125
Okay.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.364
Sweetheart.

00:12:46.364 --> 00:12:47.157
Pa.

00:12:47.157 --> 00:12:48.491
Your aunt called.

00:12:49.659 --> 00:12:52.328
She said she’ll cover your tuition

00:12:52.328 --> 00:12:55.684
as long as you work for her
after you graduate.

00:12:56.428 --> 00:12:57.638
Really?

00:12:58.626 --> 00:12:59.711
Where is she again, Pa?

00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:01.254
Spain, right?

00:13:01.254 --> 00:13:02.964
- Yeah.
- And architecture too?

00:13:03.131 --> 00:13:04.348
Yeah.

00:13:05.636 --> 00:13:06.637
Okay, Pa.

00:13:07.343 --> 00:13:08.970
- All right.
- Well, whatever can make things easier

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.474
and help me graduate.

00:13:12.474 --> 00:13:13.933
Okay, I’ll tell your aunt.

00:13:13.933 --> 00:13:15.727
She’s really excited for you
to take architecture.

00:13:15.727 --> 00:13:19.022
And you know, working abroad
is a great opportunity.

00:13:19.814 --> 00:13:21.348
Okay, I’ll let your aunt know.

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:22.400
All right.

00:13:40.293 --> 00:13:42.420
Maybe I should buy a new guitar.

00:13:48.343 --> 00:13:51.387
No. I don’t need it anyway.

00:14:01.439 --> 00:14:03.817
Mom’s acquaintance who’s a talent manager

00:14:04.317 --> 00:14:06.074
wants me to join a workshop.

00:14:06.277 --> 00:14:09.364
They saw my performance video
from high school where I was singing.

00:14:09.823 --> 00:14:12.534
And I think they want me to try being
an actor or something, my god.

00:14:14.118 --> 00:14:15.119
Really?

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:16.830
Mhmm.

00:14:16.955 --> 00:14:18.206
Yeah. Are you going for it?

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.041
I don’t want to.

00:14:20.458 --> 00:14:22.293
I just started college.

00:14:24.546 --> 00:14:25.547
Yeah.

00:14:26.339 --> 00:14:28.132
Just focus on your studies first.

00:14:28.925 --> 00:14:30.009
Of course.

00:14:37.725 --> 00:14:38.754
There!

00:14:39.352 --> 00:14:41.980
It’s a little cleaner now.

00:14:42.272 --> 00:14:43.285
Thank you, Via.

00:14:45.504 --> 00:14:46.963
You’re welcome, Kino.

00:14:47.318 --> 00:14:50.321
Just don’t be too messy.

00:14:50.321 --> 00:14:52.198
Don’t leave stuff everywhere.

00:14:52.198 --> 00:14:53.658
I brought three trash bins.

00:14:53.658 --> 00:14:56.286
So you won’t just leave
your trash lying around.

00:14:56.744 --> 00:14:58.121
And here.

00:14:58.663 --> 00:15:02.667
I saw this, Auntie labelled your utensils.

00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:05.503
Sort them properly and wash them.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:10.049
And your used plates,
don’t leave them in the sink.

00:15:10.341 --> 00:15:13.595
You really need to learn to cook

00:15:13.595 --> 00:15:17.849
so you won’t keep buying food
outside or ordering delivery, okay?

00:15:18.433 --> 00:15:19.809
Yes, Mom.

00:15:20.059 --> 00:15:23.479
And your bed is good now.

00:15:23.479 --> 00:15:26.190
It has bedsheets, you can sleep on it.

00:15:27.442 --> 00:15:29.611
But I’m sleeping at
your place tonight, okay?

00:15:29.611 --> 00:15:30.652
Huh?

00:15:31.237 --> 00:15:32.739
We have class tomorrow.

00:15:33.573 --> 00:15:34.574
It’s fine.

00:15:34.741 --> 00:15:36.492
My first class is at 10:00 AM.

00:15:36.784 --> 00:15:39.078
So I can still leave early with you.

00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:40.830
And

00:15:41.414 --> 00:15:45.251
I probably won’t get to sleep at your
place as often anymore, so just let me.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:51.174
Fine, okay. But I’m going home first

00:15:51.174 --> 00:15:53.051
because I have to run an errand.

00:15:53.076 --> 00:15:56.120
I need to buy something for Mira.

00:15:56.189 --> 00:15:59.192
Okay, take care. I’ll follow right away.

00:16:00.975 --> 00:16:01.976
All right.

00:16:01.976 --> 00:16:02.936
- I’ll go ahead.
- Thank you.

00:16:02.936 --> 00:16:03.949
Bye.

00:16:04.354 --> 00:16:05.980
Bye-bye!

00:16:22.288 --> 00:16:23.539
I think that’s Via,

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.959
let’s take a look.

00:16:28.002 --> 00:16:29.003
Via!

00:16:29.003 --> 00:16:30.004
Oh.

00:16:30.004 --> 00:16:31.422
- Pres?
- How are you?

00:16:31.422 --> 00:16:34.175
I’m all right. You guys?
You’re here in Manila?

00:16:34.175 --> 00:16:35.176
Yeah.

00:16:35.416 --> 00:16:36.542
Where are you now?

00:16:36.886 --> 00:16:39.597
Oh, I visited Kino today.

00:16:39.889 --> 00:16:42.225
He studies here,
but I’m in España!

00:16:43.226 --> 00:16:44.978
You know, we’re actually
headed to that area.

00:16:44.978 --> 00:16:45.937
We can give you a ride.

00:16:45.937 --> 00:16:47.146
Oh no, Pres. It’s all right.

00:16:47.146 --> 00:16:48.314
- No, thank you.
- We’ll take you.

00:16:48.314 --> 00:16:50.108
What do you think, Haze?
Let’s give her a ride.

00:16:52.271 --> 00:16:53.395
Haze,

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:54.963
come on.

00:16:54.988 --> 00:16:55.988
Sure.

00:16:56.531 --> 00:16:57.551
Okay?

00:16:57.576 --> 00:16:59.325
Come on, we’ll take you.

00:16:59.325 --> 00:17:00.368
Come on, let’s go.

00:17:00.368 --> 00:17:01.369
Okay.

00:17:01.369 --> 00:17:02.954
It’s just along the way.
Don’t worry about it.

00:17:03.371 --> 00:17:04.497
You’re a friend.

00:17:04.706 --> 00:17:05.707
Let’s go.

00:17:07.709 --> 00:17:08.334
Get inside.

00:17:08.334 --> 00:17:09.502
All right. Thank you.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:14.733
Okay. Goods. Yup.

00:17:15.258 --> 00:17:16.259
All right.

00:17:17.927 --> 00:17:18.845
You all right there, Via?

00:17:18.845 --> 00:17:20.638
Yeah. Thank you.

00:17:27.668 --> 00:17:28.771
The traffic is so bad.

00:17:28.771 --> 00:17:30.648
The app said this is the fastest route.

00:17:31.274 --> 00:17:32.900
- This is so embarrassing!
- But it was barely moving.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.777
Why did I even confess before?

00:17:34.777 --> 00:17:36.320
What was I thinking?

00:17:38.865 --> 00:17:39.866
I like you.

00:17:42.076 --> 00:17:43.077
Thank you, Via.

00:17:44.078 --> 00:17:45.079
Want some churros?

00:17:47.331 --> 00:17:49.584
Where did I even get the guts to do that?

00:17:49.664 --> 00:17:52.160
I hope Pres has erased
that from his memory.

00:17:53.004 --> 00:17:54.005
But it’s all right.

00:17:55.256 --> 00:17:57.508
So I can spend more time with you.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.979
Eyes on the road,
eyes on the road.

00:18:00.004 --> 00:18:01.043
Okay.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:04.098
No, but you know earlier—

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:13.775
Guys, help! I suddenly
ended up in a car with Pres.

00:18:14.776 --> 00:18:16.902
I wish someone would give me rides too.

00:18:17.236 --> 00:18:20.239
- This is my dream car, look.
- Tell him to buy churros.

00:18:20.239 --> 00:18:21.240
A sports car?

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.950
Where are you, Via?

00:18:24.535 --> 00:18:28.039
Do you still like him? This is
your chance. Try small talk!

00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:29.832
I’ll give you a ride in something
like this too someday.

00:18:31.532 --> 00:18:32.866
Let’s see. I hope so.

00:18:34.936 --> 00:18:36.020
Why? Does it hurt?

00:18:37.632 --> 00:18:38.633
Let me see.

00:18:38.633 --> 00:18:40.176
It’s just a bit strained.

00:18:40.551 --> 00:18:42.970
All right.

00:18:43.471 --> 00:18:47.225
I told you not to overwork yourself.

00:18:48.267 --> 00:18:49.268
Okay?

00:18:50.645 --> 00:18:51.646
Much better.

00:18:56.246 --> 00:18:57.777
Via, are you all right there?

00:18:58.569 --> 00:19:00.530
Yes, Pres. I’m all right.
Thank you.

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.240
Just tell me if you
need anything, okay?

00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:05.618
What about me? Aren’t you
going to ask if I’m okay, too?

00:19:06.702 --> 00:19:09.247
Seriously. Here. All better?

00:19:09.272 --> 00:19:10.556
There. That’s fine.

00:19:10.581 --> 00:19:14.293
I turned out to be the third wheel.

00:19:14.293 --> 00:19:15.586
We’ve been here once before, I remember.

00:19:17.171 --> 00:19:19.298
It’s so awkward!

00:19:36.983 --> 00:19:38.401
Are you nervous?

00:19:38.568 --> 00:19:39.569
Huh?

00:19:41.237 --> 00:19:42.488
Why would I be nervous?

00:19:42.488 --> 00:19:44.407
You always sleep here.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.663
I mean about your new school.

00:19:58.629 --> 00:20:00.882
Yeah, of course I’m nervous.

00:20:01.048 --> 00:20:05.761
But it helps a lot that
I’m blockmates with Luna and Ke.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.098
At least I know I’ll be okay.

00:20:54.644 --> 00:20:56.312
Don’t take this off, okay?

00:20:57.563 --> 00:20:59.232
I’m your only best friend.

00:21:01.776 --> 00:21:03.194
Of course.

00:21:03.527 --> 00:21:05.529
You’ve always been the only one.

00:21:10.409 --> 00:21:14.538
I’ll miss us going to school
together every day.

00:21:15.414 --> 00:21:18.876
And you, packing lunch for me too.

00:21:19.835 --> 00:21:20.836
Really?

00:21:21.504 --> 00:21:24.095
Then I’ll pack your lunch tomorrow.

00:21:24.298 --> 00:21:26.342
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:21:28.844 --> 00:21:29.845
Oh!

00:21:30.179 --> 00:21:34.475
Earlier, I ran into Pres
and he gave me a ride.

00:21:35.768 --> 00:21:37.019
You saw each other?

00:21:37.561 --> 00:21:39.146
He came home to Manila?

00:21:40.356 --> 00:21:42.942
So that’s why you went home early.

00:21:43.693 --> 00:21:45.403
Oh, come on.

00:21:46.153 --> 00:21:50.283
I just saw him, he offered
to take me home, that’s it.

00:21:50.491 --> 00:21:52.535
I was actually really awkward earlier.

00:22:01.306 --> 00:22:02.515
What was that?

00:22:02.712 --> 00:22:05.548
Go to sleep. You have
an early day tomorrow.

00:22:07.133 --> 00:22:08.843
Oh, come on.

00:22:13.306 --> 00:22:14.376
Now what?

00:22:15.516 --> 00:22:17.059
You’re sulking, aren’t you?

00:22:17.143 --> 00:22:19.937
You’re really something,
getting all sulky.

00:22:21.564 --> 00:22:22.565
Hey.

00:22:23.524 --> 00:22:25.234
Stop squeezing in my space.

00:22:25.234 --> 00:22:26.694
I’m about to fall!

00:22:26.694 --> 00:22:27.954
I’ll catch you.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:29.822
Move over, it’s hot!

00:22:31.073 --> 00:22:33.951
Wow, you get sulky fast
and you fall asleep fast too?

00:22:33.951 --> 00:22:34.970
Hey.

00:22:36.245 --> 00:22:37.204
Kino?

00:22:39.749 --> 00:22:41.667
Aren’t you going to say good night to me?

00:22:43.544 --> 00:22:44.920
Pretending to sleep without
saying good night?

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.130
Go over there!

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:47.798
Fine.

00:22:48.341 --> 00:22:49.550
Good night, Via.

00:22:50.426 --> 00:22:52.094
Good night, Kino.

00:22:59.643 --> 00:23:01.562
Kino, come on, we have to go.

00:23:01.562 --> 00:23:03.522
We’re not schoolmates anymore.

00:23:03.522 --> 00:23:04.815
It hurts my heart.

00:23:05.024 --> 00:23:09.653
Wow, here he goes again.
Mister Dramatic.

00:23:09.945 --> 00:23:12.531
What’s wrong with your hair?
Come here, I’ll fix it.

00:23:13.991 --> 00:23:15.326
All good?

00:23:16.744 --> 00:23:17.762
There.

00:23:17.787 --> 00:23:18.790
Oh!

00:23:19.372 --> 00:23:21.207
Here’s your packed lunch.

00:23:21.499 --> 00:23:23.125
Thank you.

00:23:23.459 --> 00:23:25.711
Wait, mirror selfie first.

00:23:25.878 --> 00:23:28.089
It’s our first day of college

00:23:28.506 --> 00:23:30.341
and we’re not in the same
uniform anymore.

00:23:30.341 --> 00:23:31.423
Come on.

00:23:35.221 --> 00:23:37.056
Let’s look serious and mysterious.

00:23:37.681 --> 00:23:39.725
- You? Mysterious?
- Wacky shot!

00:23:43.938 --> 00:23:47.024
Okay. Now we’re not going
to the same school anymore,

00:23:47.024 --> 00:23:49.610
so we’re not taking the
same jeep. You better take care.

00:23:52.238 --> 00:23:53.697
I’ll wait until you get on.

00:23:54.573 --> 00:23:57.827
No, you don’t have to. You might get
stuck in traffic near Katipunan. Go ahead.

00:23:58.494 --> 00:23:59.954
Via, I’m getting on the next one.

00:23:59.954 --> 00:24:01.455
No. It’s all right.

00:24:01.831 --> 00:24:02.581
I can manage.

00:24:02.581 --> 00:24:04.208
Do well on your first day, all right?

00:24:04.458 --> 00:24:06.936
You can make friends, just as
long as I’m your only best friend, okay?

00:24:06.961 --> 00:24:08.879
Yes, sir.

00:24:08.879 --> 00:24:10.256
Go on, get in. Take care!

00:24:10.256 --> 00:24:11.173
Bye-bye.

00:24:11.173 --> 00:24:13.092
Be good, okay?
Don’t get into fights.

00:24:15.302 --> 00:24:16.637
Bye-bye.

00:24:30.025 --> 00:24:33.404
What’s this?
Why does it suddenly feel so quiet?

00:24:33.654 --> 00:24:36.323
It actually feels kind of sad.

00:24:41.162 --> 00:24:42.955
First day of school!

00:24:46.834 --> 00:24:48.586
What? Via, why are you with him?

00:24:48.752 --> 00:24:49.962
He’s from a rival school.

00:24:51.881 --> 00:24:54.175
KE AND I ARE ON OUR WAY!

00:24:55.259 --> 00:24:58.012
You’re so loud, Luna.
Do you really have to scream in the chat?

00:24:58.137 --> 00:25:01.765
OMG. You guys are cute!
Good luck on your first day!

00:25:01.765 --> 00:25:03.851
Be good during the first week.

00:25:03.851 --> 00:25:05.644
No cutting class, okay!

00:25:10.357 --> 00:25:12.443
Thank you, guys.

00:25:38.552 --> 00:25:40.429
I’m so excited.
This place is beautiful. But—

00:25:40.429 --> 00:25:43.390
I don’t get it.
Where is the TBC room?

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:46.810
TBC room?
That’s “to be confirmed”.

00:25:46.852 --> 00:25:48.771
Oh, come on, I’m kidding!

00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:50.356
Let’s just find someone to ask.

00:25:50.356 --> 00:25:51.941
The thing is,
there’s no one here to ask.

00:25:53.025 --> 00:25:55.236
Are you kids lost?

00:25:56.987 --> 00:25:58.822
- Sevi!
- Sevi!

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.825
Welcome to college! I missed you guys.

00:26:03.118 --> 00:26:06.622
Oh my god, thank goodness
our savior finally arrived.

00:26:06.622 --> 00:26:10.000
Yeah, Sevi,
our room is still TBC.

00:26:10.055 --> 00:26:11.348
Can you help us?

00:26:11.961 --> 00:26:13.921
- Yeah, we’re going to be late.
- Where can we even ask?

00:26:13.921 --> 00:26:15.756
Why didn’t you just message me?

00:26:15.756 --> 00:26:18.133
Come on, let’s go to the
Admin Office. Follow me.

00:26:18.133 --> 00:26:19.260
- Wow.
- Wow.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.971
Sevi is acting like a
responsible student now.

00:26:21.971 --> 00:26:23.912
- It’s all fake though!
- We’re going to be late!

00:26:31.105 --> 00:26:32.106
Thank you.

00:26:33.566 --> 00:26:34.638
I’m sorry.

00:26:35.985 --> 00:26:36.860
Kino!

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:37.820
Oh, Via!

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.115
Have you been waiting long?

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.309
I just got here.
Where are Ke and Luna?

00:26:42.283 --> 00:26:44.702
They’re still inside.
Our blockmates invited us to hang out.

00:26:46.036 --> 00:26:47.997
Oh no, sorry you didn’t get
to join because of me.

00:26:48.038 --> 00:26:48.472
What?

00:26:48.497 --> 00:26:50.666
No! I was with
them the whole time.

00:26:50.874 --> 00:26:54.044
And my social battery’s drained anyway.
We’ve been talking non-stop all day.

00:26:54.424 --> 00:26:58.386
And isn’t dismissal time, our time?

00:26:59.592 --> 00:27:02.720
Via, let’s try to meet up often, please.

00:27:03.178 --> 00:27:05.806
It’s only the first day and
I already miss you.

00:27:05.806 --> 00:27:10.311
Oh wow, his clinginess
is acting up again.

00:27:10.311 --> 00:27:12.438
I thought you’ve matured already?

00:27:13.856 --> 00:27:15.943
So, you don’t want to see me often?

00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:16.978
I do!

00:27:21.322 --> 00:27:23.490
Does that mean you miss me too?

00:27:28.537 --> 00:27:31.123
Let’s try to see each other
more often, okay?

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.552
Come on.

00:27:33.751 --> 00:27:35.841
So you do miss me, huh?

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.365
Via!

00:27:40.591 --> 00:27:41.175
Kino.

00:27:41.175 --> 00:27:42.176
How’s it going?

00:27:42.176 --> 00:27:43.719
I’m all right. You tired?

00:27:44.178 --> 00:27:46.221
The teacher took forever to dismiss us.

00:27:46.513 --> 00:27:47.806
How was class?

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.141
Tiring too.

00:27:49.141 --> 00:27:50.458
Do you have a lot of friends?

00:27:50.643 --> 00:27:52.770
Yeah. Luna and Ke.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.313
Do you have a new best friend?

00:27:54.521 --> 00:27:56.482
- Oh, no.
- No…

00:27:56.482 --> 00:27:57.529
- That’s good.
- None.

00:27:58.984 --> 00:28:00.110
Have you eaten?

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:01.111
Fishball? There’s no—

00:28:01.111 --> 00:28:03.155
There’s no kikiam left!

00:28:03.447 --> 00:28:04.657
The kikiam was really good.

00:28:04.948 --> 00:28:06.617
I know it’s your favorite,
but there’s none left.

00:28:06.617 --> 00:28:09.203
What should I do?
Sir, can I have some kikiam?

00:28:09.203 --> 00:28:09.912
There’s none.

00:28:09.912 --> 00:28:10.788
How’s school?

00:28:10.788 --> 00:28:11.789
It’s all right.

00:28:11.789 --> 00:28:12.790
At our school—

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:13.810
Yeah?

00:28:13.999 --> 00:28:15.125
So many people look at me.

00:28:15.751 --> 00:28:16.502
It’s true.

00:28:16.502 --> 00:28:17.294
And then?

00:28:17.294 --> 00:28:19.296
Of course, I walk around like a cool guy.

00:28:20.422 --> 00:28:21.006
Oh.

00:28:21.006 --> 00:28:21.882
Hey. Who’s that?

00:28:21.882 --> 00:28:23.509
- New person—
- You’re hungry. Just eat.

00:28:23.509 --> 00:28:24.607
You’re just hungry.

00:28:29.537 --> 00:28:30.557
Eat first.

00:28:30.557 --> 00:28:31.558
Later.

00:28:31.934 --> 00:28:32.768
Come on.

00:28:32.768 --> 00:28:33.811
Later

00:28:38.857 --> 00:28:39.858
One more. It’s a train.

00:28:50.577 --> 00:28:52.454
You know, the food
here is delicious.

00:28:52.454 --> 00:28:55.541
Look, there are fried
noodles there. It’s cooked so well.

00:28:55.541 --> 00:28:57.543
They also have fishballs and kikiam.

00:28:57.543 --> 00:28:58.752
- They also have squidballs.
- Yeah?

00:28:58.752 --> 00:29:00.754
They also have that small one,

00:29:00.754 --> 00:29:01.964
the tiny kwek-kwek.

00:29:01.964 --> 00:29:02.940
Really?

00:29:02.965 --> 00:29:04.466
They also have the big kwek-kwek.

00:29:04.466 --> 00:29:05.968
That’s my favorite in the morning when—

00:29:06.885 --> 00:29:08.095
- Here it is!
- It’s here.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.162
Be careful.

00:29:20.441 --> 00:29:22.526
I can’t do this anymore.

00:29:22.526 --> 00:29:24.403
Why did I even take architecture?

00:29:24.403 --> 00:29:26.238
I don’t know if anything
I’m doing is right.

00:29:26.238 --> 00:29:27.943
I don’t know if any of this looks good.

00:29:27.968 --> 00:29:29.419
What the heck?

00:29:30.409 --> 00:29:31.410
Let me see.

00:29:33.912 --> 00:29:34.913
It looks good, though.

00:29:36.665 --> 00:29:38.208
It’s really clean.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.588
You’re really talented, Via.
That’s why I look up to you.

00:29:57.561 --> 00:29:58.562
You…

00:29:58.812 --> 00:30:00.647
You always overpraise me.

00:30:00.647 --> 00:30:02.733
Sometimes I don’t even know
if I should believe you.

00:30:02.733 --> 00:30:04.693
It starts to sound unbelievable.

00:30:10.407 --> 00:30:12.367
You know—

00:30:12.367 --> 00:30:13.619
What is it?

00:30:14.119 --> 00:30:16.663
Luna has a new boyfriend.

00:30:16.663 --> 00:30:19.666
Drix. They’ve only been together for
two weeks. She met him on a dating app.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:22.651
Really? Does Sevi know?

00:30:24.296 --> 00:30:26.840
I don’t think that relationship
is even serious.

00:30:28.967 --> 00:30:31.094
That guy’s probably sulking
somewhere already.

00:30:32.012 --> 00:30:36.642
I don’t know why Luna can’t see it.

00:30:36.642 --> 00:30:38.644
And if she’s going to pick
someone talkative,

00:30:38.644 --> 00:30:41.647
why not Sevi?
Sevi’s right there, isn’t he?

00:30:42.105 --> 00:30:45.609
You know, I feel like Luna
suits guys who are a bit mysterious,

00:30:45.609 --> 00:30:47.528
a bit serious.

00:30:47.778 --> 00:30:49.863
Of course, don’t tell Sevi, okay?

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:53.982
Kino,

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:59.414
do you like anyone in your college?

00:31:01.542 --> 00:31:02.591
No.

00:31:05.045 --> 00:31:06.588
I don’t like any of them.

00:31:07.297 --> 00:31:08.298
You?

00:31:15.556 --> 00:31:18.559
I’m asking you. Do you like
anyone at your school yet?

00:31:20.811 --> 00:31:23.522
Hey. Why are you avoiding my gaze?

00:31:25.274 --> 00:31:27.860
You like someone, don’t you?

00:31:28.235 --> 00:31:29.240
Who?

00:31:29.653 --> 00:31:31.405
- No one.
- Well?

00:31:31.405 --> 00:31:32.281
No one.

00:31:32.281 --> 00:31:33.282
Geez.

00:31:37.119 --> 00:31:40.122
What’s your type, Via? Are they—

00:31:40.831 --> 00:31:42.708
Still like Pres, that kind?

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.714
How about now?

00:31:51.008 --> 00:31:52.467
Do I fit your type now?

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:01.101
You know what—

00:32:01.852 --> 00:32:04.897
Papa gave me money

00:32:05.272 --> 00:32:08.066
to celebrate my 18th birthday.

00:32:08.525 --> 00:32:11.570
I told him not to bother,
but he insisted.

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:12.571
Then Sam

00:32:13.113 --> 00:32:14.364
knows a restaurant,

00:32:14.364 --> 00:32:16.700
a bistro we could eat at.
Are you free?

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.453
Of course. Definitely.
It’s your birthday.

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:23.749
It’s your debut, and I can’t
miss out on your 18 roses.

00:32:24.124 --> 00:32:25.709
- 18 roses?
- Yeah.

00:32:25.709 --> 00:32:27.085
No way, no 18 roses.

00:32:27.085 --> 00:32:29.129
We’ll just eat,
there’s no program.

00:32:29.463 --> 00:32:33.216
All right, fine. I’ll go. I promise.
I’ll make it.

00:32:36.303 --> 00:32:37.304
Okay.

00:32:53.654 --> 00:32:54.758
Sam!

00:32:56.477 --> 00:32:58.450
Happy birthday!

00:32:58.450 --> 00:32:59.910
Thank you.

00:33:00.452 --> 00:33:02.788
Welcome to the legal age.

00:33:02.788 --> 00:33:03.997
Thanks.

00:33:03.997 --> 00:33:05.001
How are you?

00:33:09.461 --> 00:33:11.505
I didn’t know I was wearing this.

00:33:11.713 --> 00:33:13.966
I must have picked
the wrong necklace.

00:33:14.633 --> 00:33:16.677
No. The ring looks nice.

00:33:18.512 --> 00:33:21.014
You know what,
these are all for you.

00:33:21.306 --> 00:33:22.478
Hope you like them.
They’re your favorites.

00:33:22.502 --> 00:33:23.392
Thank you. This is so nice.

00:33:23.392 --> 00:33:25.310
Via!

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:27.354
Happy birthday!

00:33:27.354 --> 00:33:28.689
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Via.

00:33:28.689 --> 00:33:30.691
- You’re officially legal.
- Thank you.

00:33:31.608 --> 00:33:33.151
Thanks. Thank you.

00:33:33.151 --> 00:33:34.820
We can start drinking later.

00:33:36.113 --> 00:33:38.048
Via!

00:33:38.073 --> 00:33:40.659
Happy birthday!

00:33:40.867 --> 00:33:41.827
So, where are we drinking?

00:33:41.827 --> 00:33:43.245
Hey, we’ll talk about it later.

00:33:43.245 --> 00:33:44.246
- It’s still too early.
- Seriously?

00:33:44.246 --> 00:33:46.331
Let’s eat first.
That pizza is so good!

00:33:47.165 --> 00:33:48.250
Are you hurt?

00:33:49.459 --> 00:33:50.493
Oh no!

00:33:51.545 --> 00:33:53.171
It’s just a hickey.
No need to worry.

00:33:53.171 --> 00:33:54.715
- Oh my.
- Oh.

00:33:54.923 --> 00:33:56.133
All right. It’s here.

00:33:56.133 --> 00:33:57.009
- Here it is.
- Hope you like it.

00:33:57.009 --> 00:34:02.639
- Happy, happy birthday!
- Happy, happy birthday!

00:34:02.639 --> 00:34:04.391
- Happy, happy birthday!
- Make a wish, make a wish.

00:34:07.811 --> 00:34:08.937
Come on, everyone,

00:34:08.937 --> 00:34:10.016
let’s all sit down.

00:34:12.399 --> 00:34:13.400
Thanks, Yanna.

00:34:14.901 --> 00:34:17.029
Let’s eat, everybody.

00:34:18.488 --> 00:34:20.574
- Where could Kino be?
- Thanks, Sev.

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:21.908
Okay. Pass.

00:34:21.908 --> 00:34:23.079
Where is Kino anyway?

00:34:23.744 --> 00:34:25.162
Maybe he messaged you.

00:34:29.124 --> 00:34:32.085
Via! I’m sorry,
we’re still shooting at school.

00:34:32.085 --> 00:34:35.839
Looks like I won’t make it.
Really sorry. I’ll just come by later.

00:34:35.839 --> 00:34:38.133
Tell everyone, I’m sorry!

00:34:44.801 --> 00:34:47.220
It’s all right. Take care there.

00:34:47.642 --> 00:34:48.769
Where’s Kino?

00:34:49.352 --> 00:34:50.771
He won’t be able to follow.

00:34:50.771 --> 00:34:52.689
He’s not done yet, still at the shoot.

00:34:53.607 --> 00:34:55.025
Another shoot?

00:34:55.901 --> 00:34:56.902
Is it a commercial now?

00:34:59.071 --> 00:35:01.907
Wow! Arkin is already modeling?

00:35:01.907 --> 00:35:05.577
Yeah. I saw him doing a
photoshoot for a perfume brand.

00:35:05.577 --> 00:35:06.286
Wait.

00:35:06.286 --> 00:35:07.454
I’ll look it up.

00:35:08.121 --> 00:35:10.165
See!

00:35:10.582 --> 00:35:11.333
Let me see.

00:35:11.333 --> 00:35:12.751
Wow.

00:35:12.751 --> 00:35:13.960
Look at that.

00:35:14.252 --> 00:35:14.751
Wow.

00:35:14.776 --> 00:35:17.272
In fairness, they’re
all positive comments.

00:35:17.297 --> 00:35:18.422
You know, we should
have him treat us.

00:35:18.446 --> 00:35:20.217
Your best friend is really
living the celebrity life.

00:35:20.217 --> 00:35:21.176
Big time!

00:35:21.176 --> 00:35:22.928
Arkin should treat us.

00:35:25.597 --> 00:35:26.723
Let’s eat, guys.

00:35:27.015 --> 00:35:28.016
Eat up, Yanna.

00:35:28.016 --> 00:35:30.102
You, eat too. It’s your birthday.

00:35:30.102 --> 00:35:32.437
- Here.
- Thanks.

00:35:37.818 --> 00:35:38.902
This is good.

00:35:40.362 --> 00:35:43.073
So good! Is this
your favorite flavor?

00:35:44.324 --> 00:35:46.409
It’s delicious.
Good thing Sam chose this.

00:35:48.286 --> 00:35:49.371
Hold on, Sevi.

00:35:49.371 --> 00:35:50.415
Go ahead.

00:35:54.251 --> 00:35:55.252
Thank you.

00:35:56.545 --> 00:35:57.516
Yanna.

00:35:57.921 --> 00:35:58.922
Is that good?

00:36:01.091 --> 00:36:02.926
Sir, another beer for my friend.

00:36:05.303 --> 00:36:09.141
Since you’re legal now,
you can drink.

00:36:10.392 --> 00:36:11.393
Cheers!

00:36:24.114 --> 00:36:25.699
This doesn’t taste good.

00:36:27.674 --> 00:36:30.427
You’ll get used to it.
That’s just how it is at first.

00:36:36.501 --> 00:36:39.379
You didn’t know about
Arkin’s photoshoot, did you?

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:42.048
I saw how you looked earlier.

00:36:46.326 --> 00:36:47.786
I was just wondering,

00:36:48.722 --> 00:36:50.932
why didn’t he tell me?

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.810
He didn’t tell me anything.

00:36:54.436 --> 00:36:57.606
Does he already have another
best friend he shares things with?

00:36:57.856 --> 00:37:00.017
Maybe he has his reasons.

00:37:00.042 --> 00:37:03.254
And maybe he thought

00:37:03.942 --> 00:37:06.636
it wasn’t that important to tell you.

00:37:07.073 --> 00:37:10.535
And it’s normal, right?
To make new friends?

00:37:10.952 --> 00:37:14.206
Even Sam has tons
of different friend groups.

00:37:15.115 --> 00:37:18.201
I get it. Sometimes it makes you jealous.

00:37:18.418 --> 00:37:22.339
But of course, we can’t stop them.

00:37:22.797 --> 00:37:25.425
Because that would be selfish.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.097
Maybe I am selfish
when it comes to him.

00:37:32.557 --> 00:37:35.143
But I honestly don’t understand why.

00:37:35.393 --> 00:37:37.229
I wasn’t like this before.

00:37:37.229 --> 00:37:39.648
Before, I even preferred
that he had other friends

00:37:39.648 --> 00:37:41.650
so he wouldn’t always depend on me.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:44.319
So he wouldn’t always rely on me
or follow me around.

00:37:45.445 --> 00:37:46.456
But now?

00:37:48.865 --> 00:37:52.035
I don’t know. I don’t
understand myself either.

00:37:52.702 --> 00:37:53.870
I’m so stupid.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.375
You’re not stupid.

00:37:59.709 --> 00:38:01.044
You just like the guy.

00:38:37.998 --> 00:38:39.499
Should we just drink?

00:38:44.671 --> 00:38:45.839
That’s good stuff.

00:38:47.007 --> 00:38:50.010
Yeah, maybe I really do like Kino.

00:38:50.427 --> 00:38:51.886
I don’t like this.

00:39:06.609 --> 00:39:08.069
- Via’s here.
- Via’s here!

00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:09.362
- Via is here.
- She’s here?

00:39:09.362 --> 00:39:10.113
She’s here.

00:39:10.113 --> 00:39:11.072
Wait a minute.

00:39:13.283 --> 00:39:16.119
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

00:39:16.119 --> 00:39:18.663
You surprised me.

00:39:18.663 --> 00:39:20.498
You didn’t want a debut, right?

00:39:20.498 --> 00:39:23.752
So it’s just the three of us, Arkin,
Aidan, and me, for your 18 roses.

00:39:23.752 --> 00:39:24.711
- That’s right.
- But—

00:39:24.711 --> 00:39:25.962
we each only have one rose.

00:39:26.855 --> 00:39:33.695
♪ Happy, happy birthday! ♪

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.555
♪ Happy, happy, happy, birthday. ♪

00:39:39.017 --> 00:39:41.353
Thank you!

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:59.662
Oh no, I had a drink.
Papa might smell my breath

00:40:02.332 --> 00:40:03.333
Are you all right?

00:40:03.708 --> 00:40:04.834
Aren’t you happy?

00:40:07.921 --> 00:40:09.839
Your turn Aidan, hurry.

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:17.514
Happy birthday, Via.

00:40:17.764 --> 00:40:18.932
Love you, Via.

00:40:19.766 --> 00:40:20.767
Love you!

00:40:26.106 --> 00:40:27.232
My turn, my turn.

00:40:28.817 --> 00:40:29.818
It’s my turn.

00:40:33.446 --> 00:40:34.447
Happy Birthday.

00:40:42.288 --> 00:40:43.289
Thank you.

00:41:18.908 --> 00:41:21.953
You’re not stupid.
You just like the guy.

00:41:23.288 --> 00:41:25.206
I don’t want to dance anymore.
This is fine.

00:41:25.623 --> 00:41:27.125
The music is so corny.

00:41:27.125 --> 00:41:28.543
Don’t be a killjoy.

00:41:28.877 --> 00:41:31.004
We prepared this.

00:41:31.546 --> 00:41:33.882
Look, there are candles
and even a cake.

00:41:34.591 --> 00:41:36.092
Papa, thank you.

00:41:36.092 --> 00:41:38.219
There are even balloons.

00:41:40.054 --> 00:41:41.055
Let’s eat.

00:41:41.055 --> 00:41:42.265
The kids want to eat already.

00:41:42.265 --> 00:41:43.475
All right, come on.

00:41:43.475 --> 00:41:44.532
Come on, guys.

00:41:44.893 --> 00:41:46.853
- There’s cake!
- Wait a minute.

00:41:46.853 --> 00:41:48.104
There’s cake.

00:41:48.104 --> 00:41:49.063
This is for you.

00:41:49.063 --> 00:41:50.064
Eat first.

00:41:51.274 --> 00:41:52.275
Be careful.

00:42:01.159 --> 00:42:02.219
Thanks, son.

00:42:03.745 --> 00:42:04.871
Want some of this?

00:42:06.372 --> 00:42:08.166
There you go!

00:42:21.971 --> 00:42:23.139
Via, are you mad?

00:42:24.516 --> 00:42:25.517
I’m sorry.

00:42:26.118 --> 00:42:29.372
Well, I really wanted to go,
but Papa was so persistent.

00:42:29.646 --> 00:42:31.606
He said he wanted to surprise you.

00:42:31.981 --> 00:42:34.734
Hey. I’m sorry, don’t be mad.

00:42:35.944 --> 00:42:37.237
Liar.

00:42:38.905 --> 00:42:40.448
I didn’t want to lie,

00:42:40.448 --> 00:42:42.784
but it was supposed to be a surprise.
You weren’t supposed to know—

00:42:42.784 --> 00:42:44.702
And your photoshoot?

00:42:45.364 --> 00:42:47.199
I wasn’t supposed to
know about that, either?

00:42:47.475 --> 00:42:49.227
Was that a surprise for me, too?

00:42:54.337 --> 00:42:55.338
I’m sorry, Via.

00:42:56.589 --> 00:42:59.217
I just went along with Mama’s friend,

00:42:59.217 --> 00:43:03.596
and I needed the money to—

00:43:04.472 --> 00:43:05.473
to buy this.

00:43:09.269 --> 00:43:10.270
What’s this?

00:43:21.948 --> 00:43:23.283
Kino…

00:43:28.663 --> 00:43:30.331
This is expensive.

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.250
It’s for you.

00:43:34.002 --> 00:43:35.295
I’m sorry, okay?

00:43:36.212 --> 00:43:38.756
I won’t do that job anymore.

00:43:41.175 --> 00:43:44.470
And I won’t ever not tell you
something again.

00:43:45.305 --> 00:43:46.723
Kino, it’s all right.

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:51.644
I can never really get mad at you.

00:43:52.812 --> 00:43:54.022
But, Kino,

00:43:56.608 --> 00:43:58.151
don’t ever do that again, okay?

00:43:58.401 --> 00:44:00.028
I want you to tell me everything.

00:44:00.028 --> 00:44:02.363
I want to know everything about you,
all your achievements,

00:44:02.363 --> 00:44:03.906
everything you do.

00:44:07.619 --> 00:44:08.786
And

00:44:08.786 --> 00:44:11.914
thank you so much for this.
I really appreciate it.

00:44:18.796 --> 00:44:19.797
Let’s go to sleep.

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.196
Wait. Hold on, hold on.

00:44:24.969 --> 00:44:26.137
I want you to listen to this.

00:44:33.561 --> 00:44:34.562
Just put it there.

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:41.861
Listen to this.

00:44:42.695 --> 00:44:43.696
I wrote it.

00:44:47.116 --> 00:44:48.117
Let’s start.

00:44:49.994 --> 00:44:55.249
♪ Left thinking in the
midst of the chaos, ♪

00:44:56.351 --> 00:45:01.981
♪ utterly bewildered by these feelings. ♪

00:45:02.006 --> 00:45:03.424

♪ as if my heart was
playing in the heavens. ♪

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.985
That’s as far as I’ve gotten.
I don’t know what to write next.

00:45:22.985 --> 00:45:24.570
How is it? Is it okay?

00:45:26.947 --> 00:45:27.990
It’s good.

00:45:28.574 --> 00:45:30.243
Even the lyrics are nice.

00:45:31.035 --> 00:45:32.036
What’s it for?

00:45:35.494 --> 00:45:37.913
I just wanted to try writing a song.

00:45:40.044 --> 00:45:42.213
I got inspired by my friend.

00:45:43.381 --> 00:45:45.763
He wanted to confess his feelings

00:45:46.926 --> 00:45:49.220
but couldn’t because they’re friends.

00:45:51.389 --> 00:45:53.099
So I just wrote down

00:45:53.725 --> 00:45:55.143
what he wanted to say.

00:46:00.815 --> 00:46:02.316
That seems familiar.

00:46:14.495 --> 00:46:15.496
Is it Sevi?

00:46:17.582 --> 00:46:19.125
He wants to confess to Luna?

00:46:21.335 --> 00:46:22.670
What did he say?

00:46:23.045 --> 00:46:25.631
Know what, I’ll just sing it to you
again since it’s your birthday.

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:27.091
What did he say—

00:46:27.091 --> 00:46:30.136
- I’ve been telling Sevi for a long time.
- Remember what I sang back in high school?

00:46:30.136 --> 00:46:35.641
♪ I dare not wish for more than this ♪

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:40.897
♪ Your joy alone fills

00:46:40.897 --> 00:46:42.606
♪ Oh, my princess, hear my plea ♪

00:46:42.631 --> 00:46:45.001
Arkin’s voice is really beautiful.

00:46:45.026 --> 00:46:46.360
He’s so talented.

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.988
That’s why I know he really
has the potential

00:46:48.988 --> 00:46:50.281
to be a singer,

00:46:50.281 --> 00:46:51.699
to be a celebrity.

00:46:51.724 --> 00:46:54.143
And I want to support him,

00:46:54.619 --> 00:46:57.413
but I’m scared that
once he enters tha t world,

00:46:57.413 --> 00:47:00.833
I might lose my place in his life.

00:47:01.083 --> 00:47:04.086
That he’ll enjoy all the attention so much

00:47:04.086 --> 00:47:06.839
that he’ll forget the people around him.

00:47:07.465 --> 00:47:11.177
I know it’s selfish.
But I’ve seen this happen before.

00:47:13.179 --> 00:47:16.724
I’m sorry, guys, but the management
has already made a decision.

00:47:17.558 --> 00:47:19.185
So what, you just give up like that?

00:47:19.769 --> 00:47:22.230
When we were making
a lot of money,

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:24.690
you wooed us so much to stay!

00:47:24.861 --> 00:47:27.155
But now, you’re just gonna
give up on us like this?

00:47:27.485 --> 00:47:29.487
Is this all just about money now?

00:47:31.906 --> 00:47:34.325
Please.

00:47:34.692 --> 00:47:36.569
I’m working on a new song.

00:47:36.869 --> 00:47:39.997
I’ll make sure it
becomes a hit. Please.

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:41.582
I’m sorry, guys,

00:47:42.317 --> 00:47:43.652
but my hands are tied.

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:45.837
I didn’t want this to happen either.

00:47:49.173 --> 00:47:50.716
Allie,

00:47:50.716 --> 00:47:53.386

Didn’t I tell you not to bother
me when I’m writing?

00:48:27.628 --> 00:48:28.953
I’ll deal with that later.

00:49:01.621 --> 00:49:04.332
Ivy, try to understand.

00:49:04.624 --> 00:49:07.501
Then fine, leave the band.

00:49:07.501 --> 00:49:09.086
Go solo!

00:49:09.295 --> 00:49:11.756
Let’s see what you can
even do on your own.

00:49:11.756 --> 00:49:14.008
You can’t even write songs.

00:49:14.425 --> 00:49:16.218
That’s really harsh, Ivy.

00:49:16.969 --> 00:49:20.097
How am I supposed to be happy
if you’re going to abandon us?

00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:24.602
I’m just telling you that I got an offer.

00:49:24.602 --> 00:49:26.562
I won’t accept it if you
guys don’t want me to!

00:49:27.229 --> 00:49:29.774
I’m only saying it might help us.

00:49:29.774 --> 00:49:33.736
It can give us connections with other
labels after so many years!

00:49:38.407 --> 00:49:40.868
You’re nothing without me.

00:49:45.289 --> 00:49:48.459
Allie, please.

00:49:49.126 --> 00:49:51.128
Don’t leave.

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:57.510
I’m writing a song, aren’t I?
We’ll become popular again. I promise!

00:50:37.883 --> 00:50:38.884
Via?

00:50:50.688 --> 00:50:52.356
What if I told you—

00:50:54.108 --> 00:50:55.443
I love you.

00:51:21.844 --> 00:51:23.387
Of course, you love me.

00:51:25.639 --> 00:51:28.225
We’re friends, right?

00:51:32.605 --> 00:51:33.731
Maybe you’re right.

00:51:57.546 --> 00:51:58.672
Kino?

00:52:00.633 --> 00:52:02.301
Are you already asleep?

00:52:33.207 --> 00:52:35.376
I want to keep you all to myself.

00:53:01.986 --> 00:53:04.780
Clea looked so beautiful in her
photoshoot for The A-List Magazine.

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:05.906
- Have you seen it?
- Hey!

00:53:05.906 --> 00:53:07.867
- Yeah, right. That’s why—
- Oh, hi!

00:53:07.867 --> 00:53:09.827
That’s why her pics are trending.

00:53:09.827 --> 00:53:10.995
- and also—
- Oh my gosh.

00:53:10.995 --> 00:53:13.497
Her face is all over my feed.

00:53:13.873 --> 00:53:16.000
Girl, I seriously have a girl
crush on this person.

00:53:16.292 --> 00:53:17.626
- Who?
- Clea.

00:53:17.626 --> 00:53:20.671
What? You don’t know
Clea Zorel Aguilar?

00:53:21.005 --> 00:53:23.424
Via, where do you even live?

00:53:23.424 --> 00:53:24.800
She’s so beautiful.

00:53:25.509 --> 00:53:27.678
- Yeah, she’s really pretty.
- She’s definitely my girl crush.

00:53:27.678 --> 00:53:30.806
Via, that’s the former child star.

00:53:30.806 --> 00:53:32.516
We’re basically the same age.

00:53:32.516 --> 00:53:34.226
But she’s super famous now.

00:53:34.602 --> 00:53:36.812
In fairness, she’s got talent too.

00:53:36.812 --> 00:53:38.856
She’s really good at acting.

00:53:39.148 --> 00:53:41.567
Even as a kid, she had so
many acting awards.

00:53:41.567 --> 00:53:43.068
And her mom’s famous too.

00:53:43.068 --> 00:53:45.404
So she’s been exposed
to the spotlight from the start.

00:53:45.404 --> 00:53:47.531
But what must it feel like?

00:53:47.531 --> 00:53:50.326
Being famous since you were a kid.

00:53:50.826 --> 00:53:52.369
Isn’t that kind of stressful?

00:53:53.106 --> 00:53:55.097
- But it seems fun too.
- Let me see.

00:53:55.122 --> 00:53:56.415
- She’s so pretty.
- Gorgeous, right?

00:53:56.415 --> 00:53:57.416
Look at her.

00:53:57.666 --> 00:53:58.667
She doesn’t know her, though.

00:53:58.667 --> 00:54:00.144
But she’s beautiful.
Her face is so smooth.

00:54:00.169 --> 00:54:02.004
Being famous isn’t always fun.

00:54:02.379 --> 00:54:04.423
Life in the spotlight is hard,

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.717
especially if you’ve gotten used to it.

00:54:07.259 --> 00:54:09.637
What if it suddenly disappeared?

00:54:09.637 --> 00:54:12.848
It could ruin not just your
family, but yourself, too.

00:54:13.057 --> 00:54:14.558
Stunning face card, girl!

00:54:14.558 --> 00:54:16.060
I’d be so shameless with a face like that.

00:54:16.644 --> 00:54:17.937
- Why doesn’t she know—
- She doesn’t seem to have pores at all.

00:54:17.937 --> 00:54:18.938
Right!

00:54:18.938 --> 00:54:20.314
She's busy.

00:54:20.314 --> 00:54:21.315
She's really beautiful.
Look at this.

00:54:21.315 --> 00:54:24.735
Via! Hey, are you sleeping
over at my condo later?

00:54:31.033 --> 00:54:34.328
Sure. I’ll come straight over after class.

00:54:39.708 --> 00:54:41.752
Via, sorry, I’m finishing something.

00:54:41.919 --> 00:54:43.879
I might get home a little late.
Just hang out there for now.

00:54:43.879 --> 00:54:46.882
There’s food in the fridge
if you get hungry.

00:54:49.218 --> 00:54:50.885
Via! Hi!

00:54:51.303 --> 00:54:53.347
Auntie, you’re here.

00:54:53.347 --> 00:54:55.933
Yeah, I just came by to drop this off.

00:54:56.350 --> 00:54:59.186
It’s because Arkin was
texting me at midnight

00:54:59.186 --> 00:55:01.689
saying he didn’t have groceries
because he didn’t have time.

00:55:02.815 --> 00:55:05.192
Yes, he seems super busy right now.

00:55:05.192 --> 00:55:08.195
He might get home late too.

00:55:08.195 --> 00:55:10.364
Yeah, he’s at a workshop now.

00:55:12.658 --> 00:55:13.659
A workshop?

00:55:14.034 --> 00:55:16.245
Acting workshop.
Oh, you didn’t know?

00:55:16.245 --> 00:55:18.831
He accepted my friend’s offer.

00:55:18.831 --> 00:55:22.668
So now he’s starting his acting
workshop at Cloud Entertainment.

00:55:22.668 --> 00:55:25.671
You know, it’s a big agency, so
this is a huge opportunity for him.

00:55:25.671 --> 00:55:27.131
Super exciting!

00:55:31.385 --> 00:55:34.805
Right. Since when?

00:55:35.806 --> 00:55:36.974
For a while now.

00:55:36.974 --> 00:55:40.185
Like during your first-year break.

00:55:40.185 --> 00:55:42.980
That’s when his workshop started.
He didn’t tell you?

00:55:46.525 --> 00:55:48.152
Maybe he just forgot, Auntie.

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.695
Maybe. Anyway,

00:55:49.695 --> 00:55:53.282
just congratulate him and tease
him to buy you a treat

00:55:53.282 --> 00:55:55.576
when he gets a project, all right?

00:55:56.785 --> 00:55:58.203
- Wait—
- All right.

00:55:58.537 --> 00:55:59.997
Wait. I have to go.

00:56:00.289 --> 00:56:01.457
Can you handle this?

00:56:02.082 --> 00:56:03.667
- Yes, I’ll handle it.
- All right.

00:56:03.667 --> 00:56:04.960
- Take care.
- I’ll see you.

00:56:05.169 --> 00:56:06.170
Take care.

00:56:08.047 --> 00:56:09.548
- Bye!
- Take care.

00:56:21.393 --> 00:56:23.020
Via, I brought pizza.

00:56:26.023 --> 00:56:27.024
Via?

00:56:28.233 --> 00:56:29.234
What happened to you?

00:56:30.331 --> 00:56:31.385
Why?

00:56:33.113 --> 00:56:35.032
Why didn’t you tell me?

00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:52.007
You’ll leave me, too.

00:57:45.978 --> 00:57:48.021
I want to keep you all to myself.

00:58:42.367 --> 00:58:44.244
I want to take a chance, Via.

00:58:48.123 --> 00:58:49.249
I like you.

00:59:08.927 --> 00:59:10.845
Do you have a lot of scenes?

00:59:11.688 --> 00:59:14.316
Actually, I got more scenes

00:59:14.316 --> 00:59:17.861
because the director seems to like me.

00:59:18.529 --> 00:59:20.948
- Wow.
- You’re famous now!

00:59:21.448 --> 00:59:24.368
Just don’t forget to take
care of yourself, okay?

00:59:24.368 --> 00:59:25.379
Yes, Pa.

00:59:26.787 --> 00:59:28.580
You did a lot of designs already, right?

00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:31.458
I don’t even know what I really want.

00:59:31.458 --> 00:59:33.502
I don’t even have a dream project yet.

00:59:33.502 --> 00:59:36.213
Don’t worry. It will come.

00:59:36.213 --> 00:59:37.214
Yeah.

00:59:43.637 --> 00:59:44.846
By the way, where’s Arkin?

00:59:44.846 --> 00:59:46.515
He hasn’t been showing up.

00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:48.350
He’s busy.

00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:49.768
How’s your class?

00:59:52.145 --> 00:59:53.897
I don’t have class today.
It’s tomorrow.

00:59:54.022 --> 00:59:55.293
Perfect timing, huh?

00:59:55.645 --> 00:59:57.652
Acting really suits you.
