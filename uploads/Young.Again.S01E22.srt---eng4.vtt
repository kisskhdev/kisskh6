00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:59.400
Kids, Ms. Liu

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.639
No

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.539
What are you doing?

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.620
Taking photos.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.080
Taking a selfie with you to post on Moments.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.139
Taking a selfie with me for Moments?

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:20.039
Ms. Liu, you don't know yet?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.860
You've gone viral.

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.900
Huge.

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.259
I didn't do anything.

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.360
That show *Hurricane* everyone's watching lately.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.159
Haven't you seen it?

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.919
I watch it now and then.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.319
The one who plays the mob boss in it.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.060
The veteran actor Lin Ziqiang.

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.199
He's huge.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.599
That's him being famous.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.020
It has nothing to do with me.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.060
But it's all over the internet.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.819
Saying you are his...

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:46.439
first girlfriend.

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.120
They even dug up photos...

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.300
...of you when you were young.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.979
Mr. Lin even posted a sentence.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.740
"Nothing in life compares to the first meeting."

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.599
It's become a viral catchphrase.

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.400
How could he be like this?

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.000
Didn't we agree back then?

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:02.139
To live our lives and never interact?

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:03.879
How could he do this? I...

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.759
So you really are Lin Ziqiang's first girlfriend!

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.159
That must make so many girls jealous to death.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.159
No, what are you doing? You...

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.639
Is he that good?

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:19.159
Just...

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:20.080
Just an average person.

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:21.800
Ms. Liu.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.500
Don't say that.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.500
Exactly.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.360
Even though he eventually dumped you.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.180
Discarded you after toying with you, right?

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:29.620
What?

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.620
He dumped me?

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.840
I was the one who didn't like him back then!

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.539
That's impossible.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.740
I...

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.680
Well...

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.199
He...

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.780
I...

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.039
I'm being wrongly accused, honestly!

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.580
Who?

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.099
Who wronged Ms. Liu? Yeah.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.719
Ms. Liu said...

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.020
...that she dumped Lin Ziqiang.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.719
How is that possible?

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:51.099
Right.

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.719
I... Who?

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.539
Who is Lin Ziqiang?

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.740
It's that show you've been following these days.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.560
The mob boss in it.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.219
Yesterday you praised his acting.

00:03:58.419 --> 00:03:58.900
Right.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.199
What do you mean "right"?

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:01.580
When did I praise him?

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.219
I hate him the most.

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.120
If Ms. Liu dumped him, then that's correct.

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.680
Right.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.240
When did you and this mobster...

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:09.219
have a thing?

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.500
No, Old Li.

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:12.060
Watch your language.

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:13.479
Who, in their youth...

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.539
...hasn't made a few mistakes?

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:15.000
Yes.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.139
Our Little Liu...

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.040
...pulled back from the precipice.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.839
A prodigal woman turning back.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:18.199
I...

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.160
Watch your mouth!

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.620
No, I...

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.500
Ms. Liu was a fresh flower stuck in cow...

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.779
How are you two talking?

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.939
Aren't you being ridiculous?

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:32.600
Look.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.680
This photo of Ms. Liu when she was young.

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:36.360
So beautiful.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.180
Isn't she just?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.639
That is what you call true beauty.

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.040
No matter how beautiful the face...

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.660
...it can't stop time, that butcher's knife.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.040
So...

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.759
Relying solely on one's face to eat...

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.160
...is ultimately a tragedy.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.079
Ms. Liu isn't like that.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.980
She...

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:54.699
...is a master of music, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.600
That's just to fool you.

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:59.480
Ms. Liu was okay when she was young.

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:01.519
Once you get older

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.420
Once you get older

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.500
she's even more capable

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.019
It's pure perfection

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.160
As long as there's a chance

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:12.480
she'll be even better than Lin Ziqiang

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:13.879
Mr. Liang

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:17.180
Comparing Ms. Liu to Lin Ziqiang

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:18.519
is really not appropriate

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:19.819
Then how should we compare them?

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.439
Any comparison is inappropriate

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:22.620
These two people

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.079
shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:25.899
On this issue

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.420
I think differently from you two

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:30.639
Even if one is a flower and the other is cow dung

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:33.019
that cow dung is still organic fertilizer

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.379
If Ms. Liu

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.139
takes advantage of this fertilizer

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.500
she might just have a Second spring

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:39.899
That's right

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.620
If Ms. Liu gets famous again

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:45.600
why not

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.360
we just make a

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.040
Retirement community movie

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:52.899
Ms. Liu might

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:55.500
even rekindle an old romance

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.720
No need to rekindle anything

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.339
Right, Never go back

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.139
My two brothers

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.579
why are you obstructing this so much?

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:03.420
What exactly do you mean?

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:04.779
What could we mean?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.139
We're just afraid Ms. Liu is young and ig...

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:07.540
No

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.040
old and ignorant, and will get tricked

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.600
Exactly

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.279
And suffer a loss for the second time

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:12.000
Be fooled for a second time

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.439
Right

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.019
No, you two don't understand

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:15.079
This second loss for Ms. Liu

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:16.100
is something she has to suffer

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:17.899
Without Lin Ziqiang

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.459
who would invest in this movie?

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:20.720
Investment?

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.220
We have the great Mr. Li sitting right here

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.980
What is that little bit of money to him?

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.800
Brother Li, the time has come to test you

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.079
Now you're calling me Brother

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.579
You realize my importance now?

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.819
To be honest

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:35.339
back when I was in office

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:37.399
with a few Producers in the film industry

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:38.480
I was actually quite close

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.720
Finding this bit of money

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.839
is a matter of minutes

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.240
Old Li

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:43.879
if you can bring in the investment

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:45.019
I will write for Ms. Liu

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.579
a custom-tailored script

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.019
guaranteeing Ms. Liu a Second spring

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.819
In her career

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:52.620
You two are talking so excitedly

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.319
but Ms. Liu hasn't said anything yet

00:06:54.579 --> 00:06:55.779
Right, I understand now

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.339
Making a movie for Ms. Liu

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:58.620
is a good thing

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.920
The life of the elderly

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.079
should be rich and colorful

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:03.339
The elderly can keep up with the times

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.720
Besides, if it's filmed well

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.279
it's also promotion for our Retirement community

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:07.220
Right? Right

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.579
Then I'll state my position

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:11.000
Whether it's manpower or resources

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.779
or the venue

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.160
our Yangliu Xincheng

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.439
will provide full support for free

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:17.019
Ms. Liu

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:18.819
just go for it

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:20.399
Well

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:21.519
well

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.420
well

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.160
then I'll give it a try

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:29.920
Hello

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:31.500
please do not hang up

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.819
The number you dialed is busy

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.600
The subscriber cannot be connected

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:39.139
Please dial again later

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:41.980
Sorry

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.759
the subscriber has set incoming call restrictions

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:45.500
What?

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:49.899
Look at this

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.959
Is it easy?

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:53.000
Not easy

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.759
That's why we need

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.240
you to step in

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:56.220
With your connections

00:07:56.459 --> 00:07:57.379
Your connections...

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.199
Who would have thought?

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.660
Once you leave, the tea goes cold.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.920
Well, you're no better than me.

00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:06.360
After I retired,

00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:08.879
students still check in on me every now and then.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.079
Among those students of yours,

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.060
aren't there a few...

00:08:13.339 --> 00:08:14.259
who are CEOs?

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.420
Tycoons?

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:16.759
Why don't you ask them?

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.819
I can find the money, sure.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.939
But then you write the script.

00:08:20.939 --> 00:08:21.459
Deal?

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.379
Don't you goad me.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.959
I'll write it if I have to!

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:25.620
Writing is easier than finding money anyway.

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:26.699
Give me a break.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.759
Your script would never attract investment.

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:29.980
I think...

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.399
you can't just search blindly like this.

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:32.700
You still have to...

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:33.620
think.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:36.240
Was there anyone back then...

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.220
who owed you a favor?

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.340
Oh, too many to count.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.639
My nickname was Li the Philanthropist.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.700
Many laid-off workers...

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.179
They all...

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:44.580
Alright.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.000
Okay.

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:46.440
Forget about the laid-off ones.

00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:48.240
Is there anyone...

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.620
who works in finance?

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.379
Someone who manages funds?

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.159
There actually is one.

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:56.600
Back then, I overruled everyone...

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.259
and single-handedly promoted him.

00:08:58.299 --> 00:08:59.240
To financial executive.

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:00.779
Call him immediately!

00:09:01.179 --> 00:09:02.419
He can't take calls there.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.419
You didn't keep his number?

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.940
They don't allow calls in that place.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.360
What kind of place doesn't allow calls?

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.179
The detention center.

00:09:09.919 --> 00:09:11.399
He's in there assisting an investigation.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.100
Economic crime?

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.940
Look at the person you groomed.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.440
That was after I stepped down.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.659
That's when he became corrupt.

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:20.000
Alright, think of someone else then. Think.

00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:23.379
Is there...

00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:24.159
for example...

00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:24.840
is there...

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:27.200
a female tycoon who pursued you back then?

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:28.679
Even if there were, I wouldn't tell you.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.039
You don't have to tell me.

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:31.259
Just contact her.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.740
Then I'll help you snag both her and the money.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.860
You'd be so lucky.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:35.720
There isn't one.

00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:41.559
Hello?

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:43.620
It's me.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.279
Oh, it's you.

00:09:48.259 --> 00:09:49.440
You haven't been locked up yet?

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:51.139
No...

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.679
I mean...

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:54.200
You're still investing in movies?

00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:56.019
That's good.

00:09:58.059 --> 00:09:59.139
There's something I need to...

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.399
Let's meet and talk.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.320
Okay.

00:10:03.679 --> 00:10:04.080
Good.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.120
You set the time.

00:10:05.179 --> 00:10:05.659
You decide.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:06.960
Alright.

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:08.460
See you there.

00:10:10.659 --> 00:10:11.240
How was that?

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.419
Nailed it.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.820
It's still blowing up online.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:18.919
They say

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.899
Lin Ziqiang got divorced because of his first love,

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.059
and that you're his true love for life.

00:10:27.179 --> 00:10:28.480
You're still laughing?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
No, these online tabloids...

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.580
have nothing better to do.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.960
Why are they digging up such old history?

00:10:35.799 --> 00:10:37.600
Don't blame the tabloids,

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.799
or us gossip-hungry folks.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:40.960
Well,

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.419
then you should blame Lin Ziqiang, right?

00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:45.059
He just can't forget you.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.299
I guess you can't blame him either.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.039
So in the end, it comes down to you.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.700
How are you so unforgettable?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.879
So after all that, I'm the one at fault.

00:10:55.019 --> 00:10:55.860
Exactly.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:56.840
No,

00:10:57.139 --> 00:10:58.519
it shows you've got charm.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.779
Tell us,

00:11:01.179 --> 00:11:02.539
how did you win him over?

00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:04.980
What do you mean I won him over?

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.059
He was the one chasing me relentlessly.

00:11:07.159 --> 00:11:07.740
Really?

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.179
Of course.

00:11:08.179 --> 00:11:08.960
So the two of you...

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
how far did you go?

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.419
We didn't go anywhere.

00:11:12.419 --> 00:11:13.620
I never even said yes to him.

00:11:13.779 --> 00:11:14.740
What?

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.200
You didn't say yes to him,

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.639
yet he's been pining for you his whole life?

00:11:17.679 --> 00:11:20.139
Who would believe that?

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.539
Fine, I'll tell you the truth.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.139
I...

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.399
Never mind, I'd better not say it.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.019
You can't do that!

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:28.740
I was just...

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.600
all ears here.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.799
And you just slam on the brakes?

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:32.200
Who can stand that?

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:33.980
Well...

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.799
If I tell you this,

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.500
you must not tell anyone else.

00:11:40.759 --> 00:11:42.080
I won't.

00:11:43.179 --> 00:11:45.759
Actually, my relationship with him...

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.200
was quite simple.

00:11:49.259 --> 00:11:50.759
One time, he...

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.080
asked me out.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.980
He told me...

00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:55.480
he liked me.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.779
That really scared me at the time.

00:11:58.779 --> 00:12:00.039
I didn't know what to do.

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:01.299
So I hurried back to the troupe...

00:12:01.299 --> 00:12:02.799
and reported it to our leader.

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:06.080
You reported that to the troupe too?

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:06.960
Yes.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:07.539
I...

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:09.740
We were so innocent back then.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:10.600
Your personal matters...

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.039
You...

00:12:11.039 --> 00:12:12.860
you needed the leader's approval.

00:12:13.179 --> 00:12:13.919
So...

00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:15.500
what did the troupe leader say?

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.840
The troupe leader told me...

00:12:17.039 --> 00:12:18.419
"You are still very young."

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.139
"You need to focus your energy..."

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.860
"on work and study."

00:12:23.559 --> 00:12:24.340
So later I...

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.740
told him...

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:26.759
"The leader said..."

00:12:27.059 --> 00:12:28.480
"you need to focus your main energy..."

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.000
"on work and study."

00:12:30.539 --> 00:12:31.700
Then what did he say?

00:12:33.679 --> 00:12:34.440
He said...

00:12:34.659 --> 00:12:35.399
"Well..."

00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:38.000
"we can at least be just friends, right?"

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:38.899
I said okay.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.000
That would be fine.

00:12:40.779 --> 00:12:43.700
Later, he treated me as just a friend.

00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:45.820
He often took me to the movies...

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.480
to the park...

00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:48.460
and walking around the streets.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.559
He was still pursuing you, okay?

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.440
And then?

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.799
Later, I also felt something was wrong.

00:12:54.799 --> 00:12:55.340
I...

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.179
I told him...

00:12:56.179 --> 00:12:58.399
"Being just friends isn't working."

00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:00.840
"Let's be just colleagues instead."

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:05.139
You were so silly back then!

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.539
Then what happened after that?

00:13:06.899 --> 00:13:07.659
After that, I...

00:13:09.019 --> 00:13:10.220
there was no "after that."

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.120
Did he never come looking for you again?

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.519
No.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.799
I listened to the leader...

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.519
and focused my main energy...

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.220
on work and study.

00:13:21.159 --> 00:13:22.240
Until one day...

00:13:22.519 --> 00:13:23.759
the troupe leader saw me and said...

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.360
"You're not young anymore."

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:27.200
"You should hurry up and settle down."

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:31.159
Only then did I realize...

00:13:31.799 --> 00:13:33.820
his son was already old enough to run errands.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.720
If he came to find you today...

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.960
would you still accept him?

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:44.860
Look at what you're saying.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:45.940
You...

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.340
what are you thinking?

00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:48.320
Him looking for me?

00:13:48.379 --> 00:13:49.419
Looking for an old lady like me?

00:13:52.059 --> 00:13:53.799
Based on my lifetime...

00:13:54.039 --> 00:13:55.360
of matchmaking experience...

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.360
since he mentioned you...

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.720
that means...

00:13:58.779 --> 00:13:59.600
he still has...

00:13:59.659 --> 00:14:01.320
feelings for you.

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:15.200
Here.

00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:16.759
Please have some tea.

00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:17.320
Here, Mr. Li.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.659
Let me.

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:20.740
Here, Professor Fan.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:21.460
Okay, thanks.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.419
Mr. Li.

00:14:23.919 --> 00:14:24.899
I feel that your...

00:14:24.899 --> 00:14:26.700
...idea of making a movie...

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:27.620
...is good.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:28.960
Excellent.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:29.600
Right?

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.059
Yes.

00:14:30.759 --> 00:14:31.240
Indeed.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.980
Mr. Du thinks our plan is feasible.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.460
Then we can rest assured.

00:14:35.899 --> 00:14:36.820
Absolutely.

00:14:39.419 --> 00:14:40.179
Let me put it this way.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.919
Based on my thirty-plus years of...

00:14:43.379 --> 00:14:44.840
...research on the film market...

00:14:46.379 --> 00:14:48.419
...I believe the current cinema audience...

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.600
Excuse me.

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:50.899
Uh, let me ask a question.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.139
How old are you, Mr. Du?

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.559
I'm forty.

00:14:56.179 --> 00:14:57.340
I started my research early.

00:14:58.019 --> 00:14:59.100
I've been researching since I was a kid.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:00.500
Back when I was little in the video halls...

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.519
...watching those pirated movies...

00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:02.320
...I started researching.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.299
How movies develop...

00:15:03.299 --> 00:15:04.019
...and where they're headed.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.539
I see, I get it.

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:06.759
I digress.

00:15:08.059 --> 00:15:09.000
In my opinion...

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.919
...the mainstream audience in cinemas today...

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.360
...is young people.

00:15:13.759 --> 00:15:14.480
In other words...

00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:16.879
...as long as we make what they like...

00:15:17.059 --> 00:15:18.399
...we're guaranteed box office success.

00:15:18.659 --> 00:15:19.279
Absolutely.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.139
Excuse me.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.639
Sorry to interrupt again.

00:15:22.539 --> 00:15:24.759
Ours is a story about a retirement community.

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:26.500
A senior community.

00:15:28.759 --> 00:15:29.460
That's good!

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:30.620
This...

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.820
...the setting where this story takes place...

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.899
...is very unique.

00:15:34.899 --> 00:15:36.200
So we can call it...

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.779
"Young People in a Retirement Community."

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.159
But the story...

00:15:40.379 --> 00:15:41.759
...isn't about young people.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.159
It's written about seniors.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.279
Writing about seniors isn't impossible.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.019
Then let's depict these seniors...

00:15:51.019 --> 00:15:52.360
...when they were young.

00:15:53.159 --> 00:15:54.559
We can call the title...

00:15:55.399 --> 00:15:56.960
"The Years of Burning Youth."

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.240
Absolutely.

00:15:59.139 --> 00:16:00.279
Then why can't we...

00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:01.899
...reflect seniors directly?

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:02.980
Absolutely.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.220
You can't.

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:06.480
Think about it, you two.

00:16:07.019 --> 00:16:08.960
Go look at the cinema entrance now.

00:16:09.419 --> 00:16:10.820
Where do you see people your age...

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.220
...buying tickets to go see a movie?

00:16:13.679 --> 00:16:14.559
That is true.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.200
Except for the last time...

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.840
...my work unit organized that movie screening...

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.740
...it's been quite a few years...

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.279
...since I've actually been in a cinema.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.419
So that means in the play

00:16:24.419 --> 00:16:25.899
there must be young characters

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.460
Absolutely

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:29.899
Of course

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.740
but Ms. Liu is still the lead

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.820
Right, the young ones are just foils

00:16:33.879 --> 00:16:34.559
I...

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.600
just went to the college students

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.679
and discussed the script

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.259
I said, stop fussing, you two

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.600
This matter has undergone

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.840
a fundamental change

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.799
The money has been raised

00:16:43.159 --> 00:16:43.980
No need to raise it anymore

00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:46.200
Xiao Cai has already contacted Big Shot Lin

00:16:46.419 --> 00:16:49.100
and arranged for Ms. Liu herself

00:16:49.179 --> 00:16:50.600
to meet him in person

00:16:52.419 --> 00:16:53.279
Ms. Liu, don't go

00:16:53.419 --> 00:16:54.360
I'm going to refill the water

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.299
Don't go yet

00:16:58.179 --> 00:16:58.899
Xiao Cai

00:16:59.399 --> 00:17:00.639
how could you do this?

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.639
What did I do?

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.019
My sister Liu is willing herself

00:17:04.019 --> 00:17:05.259
is it any of your business?

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.480
Besides

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:08.160
hooking up with that Lin guy

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.640
means we get the investment

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.059
Look how popular he is now

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:11.779
What?

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:13.480
You really don't know anything

00:17:13.519 --> 00:17:15.740
No matter how famous, he's a shady character

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:16.559
Do you know?

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.039
Old Fan, tell her

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.059
The students and I

00:17:20.059 --> 00:17:21.519
specifically went online

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:23.839
and checked the trending topics on Lin Ziqiang

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.900
You don't know until you check

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.559
but checking gives you a fright, comrades

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:29.759
Over two thousand scandals alone

00:17:29.819 --> 00:17:31.299
It's shocking

00:17:31.359 --> 00:17:32.299
Not just scandals

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.440
Tax evasion and acting like a diva

00:17:34.539 --> 00:17:35.200
They say

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.359
he even has a love child

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.960
That's so juicy

00:17:38.019 --> 00:17:39.460
No wonder he got divorced

00:17:39.779 --> 00:17:40.599
Just imagine

00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:43.660
if Ms. Liu steps into this muddy water

00:17:44.079 --> 00:17:46.240
her lifetime reputation will be ruined

00:17:46.339 --> 00:17:48.500
her life's career will surely

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:49.799
go down the drain

00:17:55.339 --> 00:17:57.799
About those online scandals regarding Lin Ziqiang...

00:17:58.279 --> 00:17:59.839
They aren't necessarily confirmed facts.

00:18:00.619 --> 00:18:01.579
That information on the internet...

00:18:01.579 --> 00:18:02.960
You two need to judge for yourselves.

00:18:03.079 --> 00:18:03.539
Well...

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:04.960
Is it definitely true?

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.619
Well, about that...

00:18:07.059 --> 00:18:08.259
We'd rather believe it's true...

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.720
Than assume it's false.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:10.660
How about...

00:18:10.819 --> 00:18:12.200
We verify it again.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:12.900
No need.

00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:14.099
No need, students.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.339
Let's discuss the script instead.

00:18:16.839 --> 00:18:18.039
The investors...

00:18:18.279 --> 00:18:20.880
Hope to have young characters in the show.

00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:22.220
That's why we invited you here.

00:18:22.339 --> 00:18:23.819
To see how to integrate young people...

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.259
Into the retirement community.

00:18:27.119 --> 00:18:28.039
Grandpa Fan...

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.359
So, having young characters...

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.539
Is it just to...

00:18:30.579 --> 00:18:32.200
Make us young people want to watch it?

00:18:32.339 --> 00:18:32.940
Right.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.059
That's exactly the point.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.640
Why don't you all share...

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:36.819
What young people nowadays...

00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:38.240
Like to watch.

00:18:38.279 --> 00:18:38.839
Suspense.

00:18:39.519 --> 00:18:40.559
What I'm thinking is...

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:43.279
Just adding a few young roles won't work.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.779
The key is having fresh concepts.

00:18:45.859 --> 00:18:47.660
That's how you attract young people.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.500
For example, let's shoot a...

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.180
Sci-fi genre.

00:18:51.319 --> 00:18:51.500
The whole retirement community...

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.900
My classmates and I specifically...

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:53.960
Are not humans.

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:55.319
They are all aliens.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.319
Once night falls...

00:18:56.319 --> 00:18:57.480
Horns grow on their heads.

00:18:57.539 --> 00:18:58.720
Fangs stick out of their mouths.

00:18:59.119 --> 00:19:00.720
That sounds too scary.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.799
How terrifying.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.039
Besides...

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.500
Aliens are a Western concept.

00:19:05.559 --> 00:19:07.559
It doesn't fit our Chinese context.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.779
If you ask me...

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.180
We should shoot a...

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.380
Modern version of...

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.140
The Classic of Mountains and Seas.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.079
Sure.

00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:17.420
Living inside our retirement community are...

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.240
The Eight Immortals.

00:19:18.299 --> 00:19:19.440
They were reincarnated into...

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.319
The bodies of eight elderly people.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.640
For example, you, Professor Fan...

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:25.960
Are Zhang Guolao.

00:19:26.319 --> 00:19:28.099
Ms. Liu is that...

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.480
He Xiangu.

00:19:29.819 --> 00:19:31.759
Uncle Liang is Lu Dongbin.

00:19:32.019 --> 00:19:32.579
Mr. Li...

00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:33.359
You...

00:19:33.519 --> 00:19:34.220
Iron Crutch Li.

00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:37.039
Why should I play a cripple? No way.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.299
This is too much fantasy.

00:19:39.599 --> 00:19:40.480
I think...

00:19:40.759 --> 00:19:42.099
We should still stick to...

00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:43.059
Realistic themes.

00:19:43.519 --> 00:19:44.460
Yusheng is right.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.259
We must stick to realistic themes.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.279
Then I have an idea.

00:19:48.619 --> 00:19:50.099
Let's write about...

00:19:50.319 --> 00:19:51.759
An ancient nursing home.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.920
Set the story background in...

00:19:54.259 --> 00:19:54.960
The Han Dynasty.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.799
Did the Han Dynasty have nursing homes?

00:19:57.799 --> 00:19:58.240
Exactly.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.740
Once we film it, there will be.

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:01.500
We need to let the whole world know...

00:20:01.599 --> 00:20:02.819
The earliest nursing home...

00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:03.640
Appeared in...

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:04.680
China.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.839
We should still respect history.

00:20:08.079 --> 00:20:09.019
We can't just make things up.

00:20:11.619 --> 00:20:12.140
Everyone...

00:20:12.619 --> 00:20:13.140
Everyone...

00:20:13.319 --> 00:20:13.740
Stop.

00:20:13.859 --> 00:20:14.460
Everyone...

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.119
Hold on a second.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.119
My head is spinning a bit.

00:20:21.559 --> 00:20:23.640
But you young people really have wild imaginations.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.619
I think...

00:20:26.259 --> 00:20:27.799
...we should stick to showing our...

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.359
...realistic retirement community themes.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.920
We have realistic ones too.

00:20:32.359 --> 00:20:33.339
For example,

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:36.579
the elderly take a drug that reverses aging,

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.000
and they all turn into children.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.500
But this play of ours...

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.039
...is custom-made for Ms. Liu.

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:43.299
If everyone turns into kids...

00:20:43.359 --> 00:20:44.220
...how does that work?

00:20:44.339 --> 00:20:46.279
Can't Ms. Liu play a child?

00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:48.599
Then...

00:20:48.839 --> 00:20:50.680
Then Ms. Liu is the only one who didn't take the medicine.

00:20:50.759 --> 00:20:52.460
She becomes the kindergarten teacher.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.980
And all the old people turn into...

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.299
...kindergarten kids.

00:20:55.619 --> 00:20:56.380
You go act in it.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.380
You go play that kid.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.839
Alright.

00:21:02.619 --> 00:21:03.960
I think our script discussion...

00:21:04.019 --> 00:21:05.119
...can end right here.

00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:07.319
From now on, let's write it ourselves.

00:21:07.319 --> 00:21:07.640
Okay.

00:21:10.079 --> 00:21:10.539
No.

00:21:16.619 --> 00:21:17.160
Not bad.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.799
Not bad.

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:20.559
Not bad.

00:21:21.359 --> 00:21:22.359
Very good.

00:21:22.579 --> 00:21:23.819
In this script, you...

00:21:23.819 --> 00:21:25.779
...added college student volunteers.

00:21:25.839 --> 00:21:27.119
That is a genius idea.

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:27.559
Right?

00:21:27.779 --> 00:21:28.079
Good.

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:28.779
Absolutely.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.039
But it's not enough.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:33.819
It's not enough.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.500
Far from enough.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.220
Let me ask something.

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:40.660
This female lead...

00:21:41.019 --> 00:21:42.279
...who do you plan to cast?

00:21:42.339 --> 00:21:44.019
Ms. Liu, of course. Right.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.339
That won't do.

00:21:45.339 --> 00:21:46.859
You're joking, right?

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.960
A huge poster like this...

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.299
...with an old lady stuck in the middle?

00:21:49.839 --> 00:21:51.680
Will young people want to watch that?

00:21:51.859 --> 00:21:52.700
Won't they?

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.519
Don't they say young people these days...

00:21:54.519 --> 00:21:55.559
...are all mama's boys?

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.359
Young people being mama's boys...

00:21:58.359 --> 00:22:00.140
...means they're attached to their *own* moms.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.240
Not some stranger old lady.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.579
That's true too.

00:22:04.859 --> 00:22:05.599
Absolutely.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.359
The female lead must be a young person.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.099
An influencer.

00:22:09.099 --> 00:22:09.619
A young beauty.

00:22:09.619 --> 00:22:10.339
A viral star.

00:22:13.099 --> 00:22:14.700
I actually found a...

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.599
...good candidate for you.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.220
Come on in.

00:22:25.819 --> 00:22:26.400
I see

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.940
Let me formally introduce to you both

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.259
this lady here

00:22:30.359 --> 00:22:32.799
is a rising star in film and television,

00:22:33.119 --> 00:22:34.759
Miss Tian Suan Xingzi

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.000
Tian

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.380
Suan Xingzi

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:38.599
Is she Japanese?

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:40.980
It's a stage name

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.500
May I ask your real name?

00:22:44.859 --> 00:22:45.640
Sun Yadan

00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:47.500
That name is actually better

00:22:49.019 --> 00:22:51.019
The name Xingzi was chosen by a fortune teller

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:51.880
It guarantees fame

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.460
In my opinion,

00:22:53.839 --> 00:22:54.799
Miss Xingzi

00:22:55.079 --> 00:22:56.359
is the perfect fit

00:22:56.619 --> 00:22:57.440
to play our female lead

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.559
Absolutely

00:22:59.839 --> 00:23:00.460
Xingzi

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:01.920
hurry up and thank Mr. Li

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.240
Thank you, Mr. Li

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.319
This gentleman

00:23:04.619 --> 00:23:05.559
Thank you, Mr. Li

00:23:06.579 --> 00:23:08.640
Mr. Li is our famous entrepreneur

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.740
His investment in this film

00:23:10.819 --> 00:23:11.980
fully demonstrates

00:23:12.039 --> 00:23:13.140
Mr. Li's commitment as an entrepreneur

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.799
to cultural endeavors

00:23:16.779 --> 00:23:17.440
What?

00:23:19.079 --> 00:23:20.160
Me, invest?

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:21.299
Yes

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.519
Aren't you investing in the movie?

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.859
Aren't you the Producer?

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.079
Aren't you investing?

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.440
I am the Producer

00:23:27.579 --> 00:23:28.619
Producer

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.119
I'm not an investor

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.700
Then what does a Producer do?

00:23:31.779 --> 00:23:32.799
A Producer is someone who

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.119
helps the investor assemble the team

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.240
manages the investment and spends the money

00:23:37.759 --> 00:23:39.200
Basically playing with other people's money

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.119
Absolutely

00:23:40.339 --> 00:23:41.779
Well, you can't put it like that

00:23:41.779 --> 00:23:43.319
We have to be responsible to the investor

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.799
So after all that, you're not investing?

00:23:49.119 --> 00:23:50.440
Isn't this just a waste of time?

00:23:52.359 --> 00:23:52.799
No, wait.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.519
Based on our investigation into Lin Ziqiang...

00:23:55.519 --> 00:23:56.880
...and those scandals of Mr. Lin...

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.279
...we double-checked everything.

00:23:58.579 --> 00:23:59.940
We found that the information online...

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.839
...is over ninety percent fake.

00:24:02.819 --> 00:24:03.539
Fake.

00:24:04.519 --> 00:24:05.920
What about the tax evasion?

00:24:06.119 --> 00:24:07.140
Fake news.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.799
Mr. Lin is a Model taxpayer.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:09.440
Right.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.000
What about the love child?

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.740
That was a friend's child.

00:24:12.839 --> 00:24:14.799
He just hugged the kid and got snapped.

00:24:15.819 --> 00:24:16.619
And the mistress?

00:24:16.839 --> 00:24:18.339
There never was a mistress.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:19.539
It was debunked ages ago.

00:24:20.079 --> 00:24:20.660
It's useless.

00:24:20.779 --> 00:24:21.880
Rumor mongers just move their lips,

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.299
while truth-tellers run their legs off.

00:24:23.359 --> 00:24:24.279
How can they...

00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:25.740
These social media accounts are just...

00:24:25.819 --> 00:24:26.880
...too ridiculous.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.720
Exactly.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:28.660
So that means...

00:24:28.779 --> 00:24:30.920
...Lin Ziqiang is actually a good guy.

00:24:31.519 --> 00:24:33.440
A good guy who specializes in playing villains.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.660
You're back.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.000
About our investment...

00:24:39.079 --> 00:24:39.680
Stop.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.460
Don't ask.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.640
No luck with the investment, right?

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.500
Well...

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.400
As for the investment...

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:46.440
...it is available.

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.279
But...

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.740
...we can't take it, right?

00:24:51.059 --> 00:24:51.880
Right, we can't take it.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:52.839
This...

00:24:52.839 --> 00:24:54.420
Who hates money? Why?

00:24:54.839 --> 00:24:55.980
They proposed a...

00:24:56.019 --> 00:24:57.539
...very unreasonable demand.

00:24:58.359 --> 00:25:01.019
They want to replace Ms. Liu as the female lead.

00:25:01.019 --> 00:25:02.039
Replace her with a young girl.

00:25:03.019 --> 00:25:03.940
Could I agree to that?

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:04.599
No.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.180
I had to firmly refuse.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.740
Of course.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.440
So we still need to keep trying.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:10.759
Yes.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:12.900
Well...

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.119
...you can stop trying for now.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.680
Ms. Liu has decided...

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.940
...to go talk to that Mr. Lin herself.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.440
Let's go get changed.

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:21.720
Wait.

00:25:21.779 --> 00:25:22.519
Wait, I...

00:25:23.859 --> 00:25:24.799
Mr. Lin?

00:25:25.579 --> 00:25:26.599
Which Mr. Lin?

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.599
The gangster?

00:25:28.779 --> 00:25:30.059
According to our investigation...

00:25:30.539 --> 00:25:31.440
...we found that online...

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.160
...the negative news about Mr. Lin...

00:25:33.299 --> 00:25:35.059
...is ninety percent fake.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:35.880
Right.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.559
Then what's the remaining ten percent?

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.099
Let's go save Ms. Liu.

00:25:44.519 --> 00:25:46.140
We need to present a united front.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:46.740
Right.

00:25:47.019 --> 00:25:47.839
You're in charge of...

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.799
keeping watch.

00:25:48.859 --> 00:25:50.059
I'll handle the one-on-one talk.

00:25:51.359 --> 00:25:52.579
Why should I keep watch?

00:25:52.799 --> 00:25:53.740
Between the two of us,

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.720
it's better to play to our strengths.

00:25:55.819 --> 00:25:57.079
My thinking is meticulous.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.400
You're simple and crude.

00:25:58.519 --> 00:25:59.900
Who's simple and crude?

00:26:00.059 --> 00:26:02.000
When I do ideological work, I always...

00:26:04.099 --> 00:26:06.079
What are you two gentlemen up to?

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.160
We...

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.799
came to have a chat with Ms. Liu.

00:26:10.319 --> 00:26:10.920
Chat about what?

00:26:11.339 --> 00:26:11.839
Chat...

00:26:12.539 --> 00:26:13.099
You do it.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.119
Okay.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:15.920
Well,

00:26:16.579 --> 00:26:17.259
Ms. Liu,

00:26:17.759 --> 00:26:18.400
Mr. Li...

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:19.759
is here to apologize to you.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:20.400
No...

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.940
Because Mr. Li didn't get the investment,

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:23.819
he feels very guilty.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.680
Guilty, right? I...

00:26:24.779 --> 00:26:25.380
You feel guilty, right?

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.279
I do.

00:26:26.759 --> 00:26:28.960
Since Mr. Li didn't get the investment,

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:31.579
he feels he let down your...

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:32.359
trust.

00:26:32.519 --> 00:26:34.819
But he hopes you won't, because of his mistake,

00:26:35.359 --> 00:26:36.500
punish yourself

00:26:36.539 --> 00:26:37.940
by going to find that Lin Ziqiang.

00:26:38.759 --> 00:26:39.920
Oh, it's about that.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.960
Ms. Liu has already made a decision.

00:26:42.059 --> 00:26:43.519
She won't go see that Lin Ziqiang.

00:26:43.859 --> 00:26:44.279
No.

00:26:44.279 --> 00:26:44.880
I won't see him.

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.279
I was thinking,

00:26:49.259 --> 00:26:51.039
having all of you with me now...

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.119
is already wonderful.

00:26:54.119 --> 00:26:56.359
There's no need to make any more waves.

00:26:57.579 --> 00:27:00.180
Let the beautiful memories stay in my heart forever.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:00.859
Right.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.819
Ms. Liu is afraid the bubble will burst.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.640
Or she might become the subject of a scandal.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.339
Mr. Li.

00:27:09.599 --> 00:27:10.759
I actually have to thank you.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.900
But I'm still feeling guilty here.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.019
What are you thanking me for?

00:27:14.079 --> 00:27:16.140
I have to thank you for not getting the investment.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:17.960
Otherwise, I'd still be dreaming.

00:27:19.619 --> 00:27:21.220
I've thought it through now.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:22.420
People...

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.799
need to accept getting old.

00:27:24.319 --> 00:27:26.880
We need to leave the stage to the young.

00:27:27.039 --> 00:27:28.279
Absolutely.
