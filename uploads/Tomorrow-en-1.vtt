WEBVTT

00:00:41.143 --> 00:00:44.438
No, we’re supposed
to do it like this…

00:00:44.438 --> 00:00:46.941
- Oh my god!
- There’s the professor.

00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:48.526
Let’s go get her.

00:00:49.735 --> 00:00:51.487
Wait, Professor, don’t leave!

00:00:51.487 --> 00:00:54.240
Professor, please,
don’t leave yet.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.282
Professor!

00:00:55.616 --> 00:00:56.909
Please, our projects...

00:00:58.035 --> 00:01:00.204
Diego, your project is late.

00:01:00.204 --> 00:01:03.332
The submission deadline
was this morning.

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:07.044
We’re so sorry, Prof. It took
us a while to finish it.

00:01:07.378 --> 00:01:08.129
Please...

00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:10.965
We promise we will
submit on time next time!

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:15.448
They kinda remind me of me,
Luna, and Ke back in college.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.931
Fine.

00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:21.976
But this will be the last time

00:01:21.976 --> 00:01:23.519
I’ll accept any
late submission.

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:24.395
Do you understand?

00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:25.438
Yes, Prof!
Thank you so much.

00:01:25.438 --> 00:01:26.272
Thank you! Thank you
so much, Prof!

00:01:26.272 --> 00:01:27.773
- Thank you so much!
- You’re welcome.

00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:34.005
They look so passionate
about their studies.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.574
I guess they really love architecture.

00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:38.409
Good for them.

00:01:39.493 --> 00:01:41.037
Sometimes I can’t help
but wonder

00:01:41.037 --> 00:01:43.456
if I even deserve the
opportunity to work here

00:01:43.456 --> 00:01:45.541
as an architecture professor.

00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:49.045
There are so many Filipinos who
dream of being in my position,

00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:52.923
but here I am, still not sure
if I really love what I do.

00:01:57.553 --> 00:01:58.565
Hello?

00:01:58.846 --> 00:02:00.806
Via! Where are you?

00:02:00.806 --> 00:02:01.974
Just about to leave
the university.

00:02:01.974 --> 00:02:02.516
I’m heading there now.

00:02:02.516 --> 00:02:05.770
Hurry up! We’re already
at the café outside the venue.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.897
The concert
starts in an hour!

00:02:08.314 --> 00:02:10.316
Yeah, okay. See you.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.740
I’ve just been trying to go
with the flow lately

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.117
since I usually don’t really
have anything to do.

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.256
He’s really amazing, isn’t he?

00:02:34.256 --> 00:02:35.633
- Yeah!
- Stop it.

00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:37.093
Hey, Via’s here.

00:02:37.093 --> 00:02:38.052
There she is.

00:02:38.052 --> 00:02:39.386
Is this seat taken?

00:02:39.386 --> 00:02:41.055
- Yes, it’s free.
- Thanks.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.765
What do you want?
Hold on.

00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:44.058
Huh? No, it’s okay. I’m fine.

00:02:44.058 --> 00:02:45.059
- Okay.
- I’m sorry.

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:46.519
- I got held up by a student.
- No, it’s okay.

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:47.353
It’s fine.

00:02:47.378 --> 00:02:48.559
We just got here.

00:02:48.588 --> 00:02:50.606
Don’t judge us
if we end up crying later

00:02:50.606 --> 00:02:52.276
at the concert, okay?

00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:54.725
I feel like my tears
are ready to fall

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.262
once I see him
and hear his voice.

00:02:56.287 --> 00:02:58.909
I swear, I’m just
gonna start crying.

00:02:58.934 --> 00:02:59.949
Come on! No big deal,

00:02:59.974 --> 00:03:03.199
I’ll even hand you
the tissues myself.

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:05.329
Hey, thanks for coming even though

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:06.986
we invited you last-minute.

00:03:07.011 --> 00:03:10.209
I just couldn’t convince
Gab and Elena.

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.030
Sorry, girls, he’s just not
my favorite Filipino artist.

00:03:13.055 --> 00:03:14.797
I’ve got so many deadlines,
you know. I’m exhausted.

00:03:14.797 --> 00:03:16.257
- Like right now
- Whatever, Gab.

00:03:16.257 --> 00:03:17.633
I just went with the flow

00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:20.535
and joined my friends
for this concert.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.054
I don’t even know the artist!

00:03:22.054 --> 00:03:25.808
He’s gonna sing
that song, My Favorite Movie.

00:03:25.808 --> 00:03:27.017
- That’s my favorite!
- Hey!

00:03:27.017 --> 00:03:28.269
That’s my favorite, too.

00:03:28.693 --> 00:03:30.246
You guys are so dramatic.

00:03:30.271 --> 00:03:31.939
It probably just has
a similar title, right?

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:33.566
Oh, come on.
Let them be.

00:03:33.566 --> 00:03:36.610
Yeah, seriously. Sorry if
I’m such a big fan, okay?

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.988
But really, why are we
even here in Spain

00:03:38.988 --> 00:03:40.197
and not in the Philippines?

00:03:40.197 --> 00:03:41.574
Right?
If this were back home,

00:03:41.574 --> 00:03:44.743
But I came along anyway because
I wanted to hang out with them,

00:03:44.743 --> 00:03:47.496
to relate to the
things they’re into.

00:03:47.496 --> 00:03:49.915
Look at them, they’re both
so happy just knowing

00:03:49.915 --> 00:03:52.209
they’ll finally see this singer.

00:03:53.644 --> 00:03:54.395
I didn’t even know
it was possible

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.631
to feel that kind of
excitement for a celebrity.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.775
I’ve never felt that before.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.427
- We match.
- We kinda match, don’t we?

00:04:01.427 --> 00:04:03.304
Though I actually
like Via’s bag better.

00:04:05.347 --> 00:04:06.891
You’re on brand today.

00:04:16.358 --> 00:04:18.068
Wow, we’re finally here.

00:04:18.068 --> 00:04:21.822
Honestly, I’ve never really
experienced being

00:04:21.822 --> 00:04:23.741
so into something
or someone—

00:04:23.991 --> 00:04:27.369
that it made me cry.

00:04:30.247 --> 00:04:32.708
Except maybe for one person.

00:04:34.084 --> 00:04:38.172
Oh my gosh!
Larkin Sanchez is so handsome.

00:04:42.693 --> 00:04:45.821
Oh my gosh, I’m so
happy we got great seats.

00:04:45.846 --> 00:04:48.759
- Exactly.
- We’re right in front!

00:04:48.784 --> 00:04:50.142
Come on, Via, let’s go.

00:04:50.142 --> 00:04:52.061
We’re so excited for
you to meet Larkin!

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.646
Let’s go.

00:04:53.832 --> 00:04:55.125
You guys go ahead, I’ll follow.

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:56.543
- You sure?
- Okay then.

00:04:56.543 --> 00:04:58.711
- I can’t wait anymore.
- Make sure you follow, okay?

00:04:58.711 --> 00:05:00.213
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

00:05:31.035 --> 00:05:34.289
Hey, Via, are you okay?

00:05:34.416 --> 00:05:36.209
You’re sweating a lot.

00:05:36.512 --> 00:05:38.793
You’re not used to being around
this many people, huh?

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.692
Huh? No, I’m fine.

00:05:41.306 --> 00:05:42.683
Maybe I’m just a little tired.

00:05:44.132 --> 00:05:46.134
Don’t worry, girl.
Once you hear him play,

00:05:46.134 --> 00:05:47.427
you’ll definitely feel better.

00:05:47.427 --> 00:05:51.097
Yes, he’s so good live,
you might even cry.

00:05:51.097 --> 00:05:52.307
I’m getting excited.

00:05:52.307 --> 00:05:53.558
I really want to
see him already.

00:05:53.558 --> 00:05:55.310
- He’s taking so long, right?
- Yeah.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.145
Aren’t they going
to call him out yet?

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.025
Oh my god!

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:07.947
He’s here.

00:06:07.947 --> 00:06:09.365
Larkin!

00:06:43.608 --> 00:06:45.443
What’s up, Barcelona?

00:06:48.363 --> 00:06:50.198
Thank you so much
for inviting me here.

00:06:50.617 --> 00:06:52.118
Thank you for coming here.

00:06:52.425 --> 00:06:54.844
And especially to
our fellow countrymen.

00:06:55.503 --> 00:06:57.254
Hi, I’m Larkin Sanchez.

00:06:58.498 --> 00:07:01.084
I hope it’s okay if
I sing my first original song.

00:07:01.668 --> 00:07:03.670
This song is about someone

00:07:04.587 --> 00:07:07.799
who wants to confess their love
to their closest friend.

00:07:10.301 --> 00:07:11.719
But at the same time—

00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:14.960
too afraid to lose
everything they have.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.666
Sing with me.

Kino…

00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:44.849
Mommy!

00:10:45.683 --> 00:10:47.894
Hey! Aidan, wait!

00:10:49.854 --> 00:10:50.646
What?

00:10:50.646 --> 00:10:51.397
Can I see?

00:10:51.397 --> 00:10:52.648
Milk? Yes?

00:10:52.648 --> 00:10:54.567
Such a handsome boy! Yes?

00:11:03.242 --> 00:11:04.660
Kino!

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.413
What’s wrong? Why do you
look so grumpy this early?

00:11:07.413 --> 00:11:08.372
I woke up late.

00:11:08.372 --> 00:11:09.457
And I still have so much to do.

00:11:09.457 --> 00:11:11.334
I’m not even done yet, and
now he wants to eat—

00:11:11.334 --> 00:11:12.460
- Hurry, Ysha!
- I’m ready!

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.961
I’m not even done
taking care of these two yet.

00:11:13.961 --> 00:11:15.129
Come here, you two.

00:11:15.129 --> 00:11:18.049
Arkin! I got a star from
my teacher yesterday!

00:11:18.049 --> 00:11:18.925
You must be proud of yourself.

00:11:18.925 --> 00:11:20.676
It’s only been a week and
you already got a star.

00:11:20.676 --> 00:11:21.844
And she didn’t want
to take a bath—

00:11:21.844 --> 00:11:22.512
Good job!

00:11:22.512 --> 00:11:24.222
because she was scared
the star might come off.

00:11:24.806 --> 00:11:27.141
And you, your hair’s a mess.

00:11:27.141 --> 00:11:27.850
Let’s fix it, come on.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.560
Wait a minute.
Let me fix this first.

00:11:30.019 --> 00:11:31.771
- I’ll leave that to you.
- Here, sit down.

00:11:32.396 --> 00:11:34.357
There you go! Show me?

00:11:34.565 --> 00:11:36.234
Wear your shoes now.
Okay, you do it.

00:11:36.234 --> 00:11:37.401
Give me those shoes.

00:11:38.569 --> 00:11:39.599
Via?

00:11:39.775 --> 00:11:41.402
Got any extra eggs there?

00:11:42.194 --> 00:11:43.591
Of course, I already
added an extra egg.

00:11:43.616 --> 00:11:44.909
I know it’s your favorite.

00:11:44.909 --> 00:11:47.537
Wow, you’re the best, Via!

00:11:47.537 --> 00:11:49.247
That’s why
you’re my best friend.

00:11:51.916 --> 00:11:52.959
The other side now.

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:54.752
Your turn. Wear your shoes.

00:11:55.378 --> 00:11:56.505
Oh no, Via.

00:11:56.754 --> 00:11:59.215
Sorry I couldn’t help you out,
I woke up late.

00:11:59.215 --> 00:12:01.092
No problem, Pa.

00:12:01.092 --> 00:12:02.844
I know you were tired
from work yesterday,

00:12:02.844 --> 00:12:04.178
so I didn’t wake you up.

00:12:04.178 --> 00:12:06.013
It’s okay, we got this.

00:12:06.138 --> 00:12:07.151
Really?

00:12:07.176 --> 00:12:08.277
We can manage.

00:12:08.432 --> 00:12:09.517
Thank you.

00:12:10.284 --> 00:12:12.245
All right then,
just be careful, okay?

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.990
Have fun, and sweetheart—

00:12:14.015 --> 00:12:15.683
If you meet any new friends,

00:12:15.708 --> 00:12:16.691
invite them over, okay?

00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:18.109
I’ll prepare some
snacks for them.

00:12:26.534 --> 00:12:27.326
Pa, we’ll get going now.

00:12:27.326 --> 00:12:28.369
- Well?
- Let’s go.

00:12:28.369 --> 00:12:29.829
- You guys ready?
- Here’s your bag.

00:12:30.621 --> 00:12:32.623
- Ready?
- I need to pee.

00:12:32.623 --> 00:12:33.291
Huh?

00:12:33.291 --> 00:12:35.293
Mira, go with Ysha.

00:12:35.293 --> 00:12:37.336
Don’t forget to bring
your lunch boxes, okay?

00:12:37.997 --> 00:12:39.003
Pa!

00:12:39.178 --> 00:12:40.221
Thank you.

00:12:41.966 --> 00:12:43.134
- We’ll go ahead.
- Thank you.

00:12:43.134 --> 00:12:44.093
- Bye, Pa!
- Take care, okay?

00:12:44.093 --> 00:12:45.428
Kino, hurry up! Let’s go!

00:12:46.971 --> 00:12:47.972
You’re so slow!

00:12:47.972 --> 00:12:49.599
Really? Are you
turning this on me?

00:12:49.599 --> 00:12:50.850
I’m the slow one now?

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.435
We’re gonna be
late again. Come on!

00:12:52.435 --> 00:12:53.394
I was just waiting for you!

00:12:53.394 --> 00:12:54.395
- All right.
- Let’s go!

00:13:17.168 --> 00:13:18.753
Stop squeezing in.

00:13:20.087 --> 00:13:20.922
Here’s the fare—

00:13:20.922 --> 00:13:23.174
Here’s the fare!
Two to Valeria High.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.802
I’ll pay for you this time
since you packed me food.

00:13:27.136 --> 00:13:28.888
I always pack
you food though!

00:13:28.888 --> 00:13:30.389
Why are you only
treating me now?

00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:32.433
Because you always pay first.

00:13:33.851 --> 00:13:35.019
Excuses.

00:13:35.843 --> 00:13:36.844
Okay, fine.

00:13:37.229 --> 00:13:39.440
From now on,
I’ll always pay for your fare.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.901
As long as we go to
school together every day.

00:13:42.102 --> 00:13:44.862
We go to school
together everyday, don’t we?

00:13:44.862 --> 00:13:46.697
Since pre-school even, right?

00:13:46.697 --> 00:13:48.616
Then we should keep it
that way until college.

00:13:48.616 --> 00:13:50.159
And when we start working,
we’ll still go together.

00:13:50.159 --> 00:13:51.243
No excuses.

00:13:52.203 --> 00:13:53.371
You’re so clingy.

00:14:02.004 --> 00:14:03.005
It’s cramped, okay?

00:14:03.005 --> 00:14:04.215
Cramped?

00:14:04.215 --> 00:14:05.216
Whatever.

00:14:13.015 --> 00:14:14.558
You’re so mean, Avianna.

00:14:15.142 --> 00:14:16.310
Scoot! Move!

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.656
- Hurry up! You’re so slow.
- Yeah. Let’s go.

00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:31.953
Wait, your lunch, hold on.

00:14:31.978 --> 00:14:33.319
I’ll just grab it later
from your room.

00:14:33.619 --> 00:14:34.245
What?

00:14:34.245 --> 00:14:35.454
Don’t you dare come
to our classroom,

00:14:35.454 --> 00:14:36.664
especially with your friends.

00:14:36.664 --> 00:14:38.165
You guys are scaring
my classmates.

00:14:38.499 --> 00:14:39.375
Why? Do I—

00:14:39.375 --> 00:14:40.418
Just get it from me
at the canteen later.

00:14:40.418 --> 00:14:41.794
Do I really look that scary?

00:14:43.963 --> 00:14:45.423
My classmates said

00:14:45.423 --> 00:14:46.549
you look like a troublemaker

00:14:46.549 --> 00:14:48.259
and that you’re
always getting into fights.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:51.303
No way. I don’t join them,
I just watch.

00:14:51.303 --> 00:14:53.180
I’m actually really nice!

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.599
Anyway, just get it
at the canteen later

00:14:55.599 --> 00:14:56.559
and seriously—

00:14:56.559 --> 00:14:59.812
don’t get into any fights,
or I’ll tell Aunt Allie, okay?

00:15:00.229 --> 00:15:01.647
I won’t! I promise!

00:15:02.773 --> 00:15:03.357
Good.

00:15:03.357 --> 00:15:03.899
Okay.

00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:05.151
I’m heading this way.
You go that way. Bye!

00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:05.985
I’m going with you.

00:15:05.985 --> 00:15:06.861
No, it’s fine!

00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:08.070
I’m taking you
to your classroom.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.031
That’s enough. Go already!

00:15:10.031 --> 00:15:10.781
Bye!

00:15:10.781 --> 00:15:12.199
Okay, see you!

00:15:12.199 --> 00:15:14.035
Later!
At lunch!

00:15:15.411 --> 00:15:18.256
Okay, class,
for our art project,

00:15:18.281 --> 00:15:20.575
I want you to
draw a historical site

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.643
in the Philippines.

00:15:22.835 --> 00:15:25.463
Don’t worry,
you will do it by group.

00:15:26.964 --> 00:15:28.466
Hey, it’s a group project!

00:15:29.341 --> 00:15:30.342
Class, listen.

00:15:30.676 --> 00:15:32.370
You can choose your groupmates.

00:15:33.137 --> 00:15:34.597
Three members for each group.

00:15:34.597 --> 00:15:36.891
This is what I hate
the most about group projects,

00:15:36.891 --> 00:15:39.351
letting us choose
our own groupmates.

00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:41.103
I don’t really have
any close friends here.

00:15:41.103 --> 00:15:42.961
And it’s only been
one week of classes,

00:15:42.986 --> 00:15:45.530
how am I supposed
to make friends?

00:15:47.359 --> 00:15:48.360
So how did they manage

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.029
to get close to
each other so fast?

00:15:52.865 --> 00:15:55.868
Rock, Paper, Scissors,
whoever loses—

00:15:57.203 --> 00:15:58.954
Hi!

00:16:00.039 --> 00:16:02.500
There’s only two of us.
You wanna join our group?

00:16:02.875 --> 00:16:03.459
Huh?

00:16:03.459 --> 00:16:04.919
Yes, you’re joining us.

00:16:04.919 --> 00:16:05.586
You’re our groupmate
now so I’ll go ahead

00:16:05.586 --> 00:16:06.712
and write your name down.

00:16:06.712 --> 00:16:08.964
Avia… Aviana. Right?

00:16:08.964 --> 00:16:09.965
Did I spell it right?

00:16:09.965 --> 00:16:10.966
Double N.

00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:12.343
Double N.

00:16:12.343 --> 00:16:13.761
Why is your nickname Via?

00:16:13.761 --> 00:16:15.925
Why not Ana?

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:16.572
- Right?
- Avi, Avi.

00:16:16.597 --> 00:16:17.556
Why not Avi?

00:16:18.511 --> 00:16:19.598
I don’t know.

00:16:19.934 --> 00:16:23.521
Ma’am! Group one.
We’re group one.

00:16:23.521 --> 00:16:25.189
Did everybody hear us?

00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:26.148
This girl is really—

00:16:26.148 --> 00:16:27.149
There’s no prize!

00:16:27.149 --> 00:16:28.150
What are you talking about?

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.193
- That’s just how it is.
- Okay?

00:16:29.193 --> 00:16:30.778
- We’ll be presenting first.
- Perfect!

00:16:30.778 --> 00:16:32.446
So if someone
has a similar concept,

00:16:32.446 --> 00:16:33.364
it would look
like they copied us

00:16:33.364 --> 00:16:34.281
and not the other way around.

00:16:34.281 --> 00:16:36.325
- Aren’t I smart?
- You’re right!

00:16:36.325 --> 00:16:37.535
Smart, right?

00:16:37.535 --> 00:16:39.745
And with that,
she’s going to be the leader.

00:16:39.745 --> 00:16:41.163
- She’s the leader, okay?
- Huh?

00:16:41.163 --> 00:16:42.331
- Me?
- Yes.

00:16:42.331 --> 00:16:43.165
Why me?

00:16:43.165 --> 00:16:43.707
See—

00:16:43.707 --> 00:16:44.333
- It’s right there.
- Look at this.

00:16:44.333 --> 00:16:45.459
- Leader.
- Leader.

00:16:45.459 --> 00:16:47.461
Avianna. Double N.

00:16:47.461 --> 00:16:48.170
- Double N.
- Chill!

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.296
Hey, we’re just
fooling around, okay?

00:16:49.296 --> 00:16:50.089
It’s all a joke.

00:16:50.089 --> 00:16:51.132
This is just how we are.

00:16:51.132 --> 00:16:52.466
What’re your socials? Hurry up.

00:16:52.466 --> 00:16:53.050
- Write it here.
- Write your socials here.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.223
Write it at the back instead,

00:16:54.248 --> 00:16:55.010
we wouldn’t want
the teacher to see it.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:56.345
We’re gonna create
our own group chat.

00:16:56.345 --> 00:16:58.013
Right. Avianna, with double N.

00:16:58.013 --> 00:17:01.559
Avianna, with double N.

00:17:06.689 --> 00:17:09.942
Luna: Hello, groupmates!
Let’s gooo!

00:17:09.942 --> 00:17:11.068
Luna: Hello!
Luna: Hello!

00:17:11.068 --> 00:17:12.194
Luna: Hellooo!!!
Kierra: You’re so noisy!

00:17:12.194 --> 00:17:13.737
Luna: What? Just a thumbs up?

00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:20.369
- I kind of want some more.
- I don’t want any.

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:22.413
Ke, Luna! Come here!

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.794
Maybe later.
We’ll be back. Thanks!

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.798
Hey! Hope it’s okay
if we sit with you.

00:17:33.382 --> 00:17:34.592
Hi.

00:17:36.302 --> 00:17:37.928
Do you usually eat alone?

00:17:40.023 --> 00:17:42.641
Really? You should
join us next time.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:45.895
Eating alone
can feel sad, right?

00:17:48.022 --> 00:17:49.630
That looks so good.

00:17:49.655 --> 00:17:50.791
The way it’s cooked is perfect.

00:17:50.816 --> 00:17:51.817
The yolk is fully intact.

00:17:51.817 --> 00:17:53.110
Did you cook that?

00:17:54.194 --> 00:17:55.362
You really cook?

00:17:56.405 --> 00:17:57.740
Wow.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.533
Ke, see that? She can cook.

00:17:59.992 --> 00:18:01.160
I know how to cook, too.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.786
Why don’t you cook for me then?

00:18:06.248 --> 00:18:07.249
Give me some.

00:18:13.589 --> 00:18:14.715
This is Lance, my boyfriend.

00:18:17.343 --> 00:18:18.385
Who were you with earlier?

00:18:19.345 --> 00:18:21.263
Philip, my classmate.

00:18:21.263 --> 00:18:22.940
Didn’t I tell you to
stay away from him?

00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:24.778
And where were you last night?

00:18:25.434 --> 00:18:26.462
Huh?

00:18:26.487 --> 00:18:28.447
I didn’t allow you to go.
Did I tell you to go?

00:18:28.687 --> 00:18:31.398
I’m sorry. Don’t be mad.

00:18:31.924 --> 00:18:34.426
Luna’s boyfriend
is so controlling.

00:18:34.526 --> 00:18:35.986
I wonder what
she sees in him.

00:18:35.986 --> 00:18:37.821
Come on, don’t be mad.

00:18:39.531 --> 00:18:40.532
Gotcha!

00:18:41.447 --> 00:18:42.718
Kino! What are you doing?

00:18:42.743 --> 00:18:43.817
Where’s my lunch?

00:18:44.245 --> 00:18:45.412
My lunch.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.211
I thought you were suspended?

00:18:53.087 --> 00:18:54.213
Let’s talk later.

00:18:54.546 --> 00:18:56.131
Don’t be mad, please.

00:19:00.803 --> 00:19:02.304
This looks so good.

00:19:03.847 --> 00:19:04.848
Save it for later!

00:19:04.848 --> 00:19:06.392
You’ll run out of food
if you eat it now.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.271
Your friends?

00:19:12.171 --> 00:19:13.931
- My groupmates.
- Hi, groupmates.

00:19:13.956 --> 00:19:14.900
Hi.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.777
All right, you guys eat first.
I’ll be over there.

00:19:18.946 --> 00:19:20.155
Bye-bye.

00:19:23.742 --> 00:19:24.868
Your boyfriend?

00:19:25.703 --> 00:19:26.912
Your boyfriend?

00:19:26.912 --> 00:19:27.888
No.

00:19:27.913 --> 00:19:29.623
We’re just childhood friends.
Best friends.

00:19:29.623 --> 00:19:30.874
Oh…

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:32.730
Best friends...

00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:34.185
Best friends, huh? Okay.

00:19:34.461 --> 00:19:36.088
Let’s talk about
the art project.

00:19:50.051 --> 00:19:52.220
All right, team.
Gather around, please.

00:19:57.318 --> 00:19:58.152
As you all know,

00:19:58.152 --> 00:20:00.529
we have four
new players this year.

00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:02.489
And as part of our tradition,

00:20:02.489 --> 00:20:05.075
we’ll be doing
a skills demo drill.

00:20:05.075 --> 00:20:06.076
Okay?

00:20:06.076 --> 00:20:07.828
I want you to show us
what you’ve got.

00:20:08.329 --> 00:20:09.330
Do your best,

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.082
this is your time to shine
and impress the seniors.

00:20:12.082 --> 00:20:13.107
Okay?

00:20:13.218 --> 00:20:14.219
Come on, let’s go!

00:20:40.194 --> 00:20:41.612
Why’d you throw it, bro?

00:20:44.298 --> 00:20:46.901
Girl in orange, sorry,
we didn’t mean to hit you.

00:20:46.926 --> 00:20:48.136
Can you pass the ball?

00:20:53.148 --> 00:20:54.224
Thanks, you’re the best!

00:20:54.249 --> 00:20:57.336
Oh my god,
Camero’s so handsome.

00:20:57.336 --> 00:20:59.213
He’s really good-looking.

00:20:59.213 --> 00:21:01.215
Do you think
he has a girlfriend?

00:21:04.752 --> 00:21:06.725
[background chattering]

00:21:06.845 --> 00:21:08.222
You’re all getting too distracted.

00:21:08.247 --> 00:21:09.336
Focus on the game.

00:21:21.871 --> 00:21:22.711
I’ll go ahead, bro.

00:21:22.736 --> 00:21:23.752
Okay, bye.

00:21:25.311 --> 00:21:26.397
Finished with your training?

00:21:26.782 --> 00:21:28.822
I told you to go
home first, right?

00:21:29.076 --> 00:21:31.870
I also told you
we’d go home together.

00:21:32.383 --> 00:21:34.176
And I didn’t even
wait that long.

00:21:34.498 --> 00:21:35.999
We had a meeting
at the music club.

00:21:35.999 --> 00:21:39.420
I joined so you know
I can play at events.

00:21:40.331 --> 00:21:42.107
That’s good, because I thought

00:21:42.131 --> 00:21:44.341
you’d still try to
force your way

00:21:44.341 --> 00:21:46.135
into the girls’ volleyball team.

00:21:46.927 --> 00:21:49.138
You know, I really
don’t get your coach.

00:21:49.138 --> 00:21:52.599
Why won’t she let me join the
girls’ volleyball team?

00:21:52.599 --> 00:21:56.437
I’m tall, I’m good.
I just don’t get it.

00:21:58.188 --> 00:22:00.994
You don’t get why you
can’t get into the girls’

00:22:01.019 --> 00:22:02.356
volleyball team?

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.847
Explain it to me. Why?

00:22:07.723 --> 00:22:08.515
By the way,

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.919
maybe you’d like to
join the music club too.

00:22:14.288 --> 00:22:15.307
Pass.

00:22:15.831 --> 00:22:16.837
Stingy.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:19.751
Am I sleeping over
at your place tonight?

00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:20.752
Come on.

00:22:20.752 --> 00:22:21.753
Okay.

00:22:27.843 --> 00:22:29.303
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:22:29.303 --> 00:22:30.554
We’re here.

00:22:31.138 --> 00:22:33.265
- Hi, Via!
- Via!

00:22:33.265 --> 00:22:35.100
Hello, Ysha, Mira!

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:35.893
Hi, Via!

00:22:35.893 --> 00:22:38.103
- What are you guys doing?
- Hi, Arkin!

00:22:38.253 --> 00:22:39.571
You guys should eat now.

00:22:39.605 --> 00:22:40.981
- Hey, Aidan!
- Hoy, Aidan!

00:22:40.981 --> 00:22:42.024
You guys are back.

00:22:42.024 --> 00:22:42.566
- Hello, Pa.
- Pa.

00:22:42.566 --> 00:22:44.109
Kino’s gonna sleep here.

00:22:44.244 --> 00:22:45.294
Okay.

00:22:45.319 --> 00:22:45.861
Can I get a kiss first?

00:22:45.861 --> 00:22:47.488
You have a lot
of clothes there, right?

00:22:47.488 --> 00:22:49.323
Yes, plenty in her room.

00:22:49.323 --> 00:22:50.699
Okay, change first,

00:22:50.699 --> 00:22:52.784
then I’ll call you
when it’s time to eat.

00:22:52.784 --> 00:22:53.785
All right.

00:22:53.785 --> 00:22:54.966
Okay?

00:22:55.621 --> 00:22:57.247
That’s enough.

00:22:57.539 --> 00:22:58.540
We’ll go upstairs, Pa.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.917
- Okay.
- Be careful.

00:23:00.876 --> 00:23:01.877
You’re getting heavy.

00:23:02.836 --> 00:23:04.546
You’re getting really heavy.

00:23:10.771 --> 00:23:11.772
I’m borrowing this.

00:23:19.163 --> 00:23:21.040
How’s that song you’re writing?

00:23:22.814 --> 00:23:23.815
Not done yet.

00:23:24.733 --> 00:23:26.652
I don’t even know
what it’s about.

00:23:27.486 --> 00:23:28.495
Why?

00:23:28.946 --> 00:23:30.531
Do you want to write a song?

00:23:46.293 --> 00:23:47.878
Come on, sing the verse.

00:23:49.633 --> 00:23:50.634
Sing the verse.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:52.391
Come on.

00:23:55.297 --> 00:23:57.616
Why not? Your voice
is really beautiful.

00:23:57.747 --> 00:24:00.875
You’d really fit in
the music club. Please join.

00:24:01.163 --> 00:24:04.875
I’m not really into music,
so I’ll pass.

00:24:06.938 --> 00:24:07.939
Well,

00:24:08.527 --> 00:24:11.738
at least now you’re interested
in making friends with others.

00:24:12.362 --> 00:24:13.363
Friends?

00:24:13.388 --> 00:24:14.276
Yes.

00:24:14.301 --> 00:24:15.302
With who?

00:24:15.552 --> 00:24:16.470
The girls you were
eating lunch with,

00:24:16.495 --> 00:24:17.912
your groupmates.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:20.944
Luna and Kierra?

00:24:20.969 --> 00:24:23.764
They’re not my friends.
They just ate with me.

00:24:24.585 --> 00:24:26.086
Then be friends with them.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.504
They seem okay.

00:24:28.547 --> 00:24:30.798
Sometimes, I worry about you.

00:24:30.823 --> 00:24:33.493
I’m fine being alone.

00:24:33.594 --> 00:24:35.887
And those girls
wouldn’t want to be friends

00:24:35.887 --> 00:24:37.180
with someone like me.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.724
We’re really just groupmates.

00:24:39.638 --> 00:24:40.639
Why not?

00:24:40.664 --> 00:24:42.874
Don’t they know
the perks of being friends

00:24:42.899 --> 00:24:44.526
with Avianna Diaz?

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.906
First—

00:24:47.649 --> 00:24:48.817
Free lunch.

00:24:49.301 --> 00:24:50.302
Second—

00:24:51.278 --> 00:24:52.571
Free lunch.

00:24:53.238 --> 00:24:53.989
Third—

00:24:53.989 --> 00:24:56.742
That’s all the perks
you can think of? Really?

00:24:56.742 --> 00:24:57.843
Take a guess.

00:24:57.868 --> 00:24:58.869
Free lunch?

00:24:58.949 --> 00:24:59.950
Right.

00:25:01.121 --> 00:25:02.256
Okay, fine.

00:25:02.539 --> 00:25:03.540
Let’s make a deal.

00:25:04.625 --> 00:25:06.126
If you befriend them,

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.421
I’ll never ask you
to make my lunch. Ever.

00:25:09.421 --> 00:25:11.406
Forever and ever. Well?

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:13.342
We got ourselves a deal?

00:25:13.634 --> 00:25:14.509
Come on.

00:25:14.509 --> 00:25:15.302
Really?

00:25:15.302 --> 00:25:16.303
Yes.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.171
All right then.

00:25:17.196 --> 00:25:18.781
- No take-backs, okay?
- You said it.

00:25:18.806 --> 00:25:19.811
Yeah.

00:25:20.641 --> 00:25:22.601
Via, Arkin, time to eat!

00:25:22.601 --> 00:25:23.477
Food’s ready.

00:25:23.477 --> 00:25:24.478
Just in time, I’m hungry.

00:25:25.062 --> 00:25:26.063
Let’s go!

00:25:31.693 --> 00:25:33.487
Luna: Announcement!
Groupmates!

00:25:33.487 --> 00:25:36.448
Let’s do our project at
Kierra’s house this Saturday,

00:25:36.448 --> 00:25:39.368
1 p.m. onwards.
There’ll be free snacks,

00:25:39.368 --> 00:25:42.079
the room’s air-conditioned,
and the bathroom has a bidet,

00:25:42.079 --> 00:25:45.582
so make sure you
can come, okay? Okay!

00:25:48.043 --> 00:25:49.878
Oh no. This is the first time

00:25:49.878 --> 00:25:52.255
I’ll be going to
a classmate’s house.

00:25:52.255 --> 00:25:53.423
Kinda nerve-wracking…

00:25:56.051 --> 00:25:57.844
- Via, don’t be shy.
- Via!

00:25:57.844 --> 00:26:00.514
Put your stuff there and make
yourself at home, okay?

00:26:00.514 --> 00:26:02.209
- Thanks.
- Come here, sit here.

00:26:02.599 --> 00:26:03.600
Look.

00:26:04.267 --> 00:26:06.436
See this? I drew it.

00:26:06.436 --> 00:26:07.255
Is it good?

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.281
Yes, it’s really nice.

00:26:08.306 --> 00:26:09.307
So pretty.

00:26:09.731 --> 00:26:11.358
Even this one’s really good.

00:26:11.358 --> 00:26:14.758
I made this. It’s better
than Luna’s, right?

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:16.955
Wow.

00:26:17.823 --> 00:26:20.033
They both look great,

00:26:20.033 --> 00:26:24.538
but I’m not sure
if I can draw that good.

00:26:24.538 --> 00:26:27.165
What?
We’ve seen your drawings.

00:26:27.165 --> 00:26:28.500
You know, I actually
think the three of us

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:29.751
will get the highest grades.

00:26:31.002 --> 00:26:32.504
Someone’s full of herself.

00:26:32.504 --> 00:26:33.630
It’s true though.

00:26:33.922 --> 00:26:34.965
Come on, take your
stuff out already.

00:26:34.965 --> 00:26:35.882
Girls!

00:26:35.882 --> 00:26:37.217
- Mommy!
- Hi, Auntie.

00:26:37.217 --> 00:26:38.385
I brought some snacks.

00:26:38.385 --> 00:26:39.556
Mommy, this is Via, by the way.

00:26:39.581 --> 00:26:41.833
Auntie, Via’s our friend.

00:26:42.472 --> 00:26:44.599
- Hi, Via! Welcome!
- Hello.

00:26:45.308 --> 00:26:47.886
Girls, if you need me,
I’ll just be downstairs, okay?

00:26:47.918 --> 00:26:49.337
- Okay, Auntie.
- I’ll be downstairs.

00:26:49.362 --> 00:26:50.905
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:51.978
Thank you so much.

00:26:52.023 --> 00:26:54.568
My god, I’m so
excited for the food.

00:26:54.568 --> 00:26:55.736
What? I thought—

00:26:55.736 --> 00:26:56.611
Friend?

00:26:56.611 --> 00:26:57.612
Huh?

00:26:57.672 --> 00:26:58.589
Friend?

00:26:58.613 --> 00:27:01.434
Why? You don’t want
to be our friend?

00:27:01.459 --> 00:27:03.211
If I were Via, I wouldn’t want
to be your friend either.

00:27:03.236 --> 00:27:04.494
Hey! I’m nice, okay?

00:27:04.494 --> 00:27:06.037
- Huh?
- Via, I promise I’m really nice.

00:27:06.037 --> 00:27:07.706
You know what, I’ll even give
you my chicken skin

00:27:07.706 --> 00:27:10.943
and I’ll go with you
anywhere, anytime.

00:27:10.968 --> 00:27:13.241
I can even help you
with your assignments.

00:27:13.424 --> 00:27:14.425
I promise.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:16.285
I’ll do all that for you.

00:27:16.882 --> 00:27:18.550
But, why me?

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:19.509
Why not?

00:27:19.509 --> 00:27:20.510
Yeah, why not?

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.345
Well, you’re our friend now.
You don’t have a choice.

00:27:22.345 --> 00:27:23.346
Exactly.

00:27:24.014 --> 00:27:25.849
So here it is. Give me that.

00:27:25.849 --> 00:27:28.894
We’ll always be with you, okay?
You can’t be alone.

00:27:29.561 --> 00:27:30.771
Hey, let’s eat.

00:27:30.771 --> 00:27:31.396
Oh, right!

00:27:31.396 --> 00:27:32.939
Try this, quick.
It’s really good.

00:27:32.939 --> 00:27:38.153
You know, for our project,
we should just collaborate.

00:27:38.153 --> 00:27:40.363
Since our styles
are kind of different.

00:27:40.363 --> 00:27:41.823
This girl is such a—

00:27:41.823 --> 00:27:43.200
What? I just want to shine.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.993
And I want it to be
colorful and you—

00:27:46.203 --> 00:27:48.163
I should’ve asked
Auntie for some ham.

00:27:49.372 --> 00:27:51.455
Via: Sorry, Kino,
you lost the deal.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.459
I’ve got friends now.

00:27:52.459 --> 00:27:55.420
Via: So no more
lunch for you. Haha.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:56.797
Arkin: Waaahh!

00:28:01.551 --> 00:28:02.844
Good morning!

00:28:06.973 --> 00:28:10.755
Wow, you still packed
me lunch. Unbelievable.

00:28:11.019 --> 00:28:12.687
You’re really heaven-sent, Via.

00:28:12.687 --> 00:28:14.815
You’re such a kind person,
an actual angel.

00:28:14.815 --> 00:28:16.233
I’m willing to worship you.

00:28:16.233 --> 00:28:17.818
Via… Via...

00:28:17.818 --> 00:28:18.777
This looks good—

00:28:19.352 --> 00:28:21.571
You’re so dramatic.
So annoying.

00:28:21.571 --> 00:28:25.700
I thought you were serious about
not making me lunch anymore.

00:28:25.992 --> 00:28:30.664
Why did you even make a bet
if you couldn’t let go?

00:28:30.664 --> 00:28:31.873
You probably—

00:28:32.666 --> 00:28:36.211
You probably thought I couldn’t
make any friends, huh?

00:28:36.211 --> 00:28:38.272
No way! I was
actually manifesting it.

00:28:38.297 --> 00:28:41.509
And I can totally live
without lunch

00:28:41.534 --> 00:28:44.286
if it means you’d
make friends.

00:28:44.594 --> 00:28:45.804
- Via...
- What?

00:28:45.829 --> 00:28:48.164
I’m willing to
skip lunch for you.

00:28:48.849 --> 00:28:50.600
That’s why I packed you lunch,

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.982
so I wouldn’t feel
guilty if you didn’t eat.

00:28:57.533 --> 00:28:58.523
Wait a second.

00:28:58.548 --> 00:29:00.759
Your necktie’s all messy.
Let me fix it.

00:29:00.784 --> 00:29:01.743
Okay.

00:29:01.768 --> 00:29:02.859
Hold on.

00:29:03.154 --> 00:29:06.074
Hey, that surprise quiz from
Sir Sabado was so hard.

00:29:06.074 --> 00:29:07.826
I think I barely passed.

00:29:08.201 --> 00:29:09.619
He gave us one, too.

00:29:09.619 --> 00:29:11.371
I probably failed mine.

00:29:11.955 --> 00:29:13.498
No way, your score’s high.

00:29:13.498 --> 00:29:16.042
We checked your papers,
you got nine out of ten.

00:29:16.042 --> 00:29:17.047
Really?

00:29:17.586 --> 00:29:19.045
Apparently,
I’m good at guessing.

00:29:21.423 --> 00:29:22.173
All done?

00:29:22.173 --> 00:29:23.174
Yeah.

00:29:23.633 --> 00:29:24.634
Nice.

00:29:25.385 --> 00:29:26.503
Arkin!

00:29:26.528 --> 00:29:28.572
Hi, Ysha! Good morning—

00:29:28.597 --> 00:29:29.681
Hey, what happened to your hair?

00:29:29.706 --> 00:29:32.459
It’s messy. Come on,
let’s fix it over there.

00:29:32.726 --> 00:29:34.686
How are you?
Have you eaten breakfast?

00:29:35.186 --> 00:29:36.730
Did you eat well?
Did you eat a lot?

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:37.783
- Yes.
- You ate a lot?

00:29:38.023 --> 00:29:39.124
Yes.

00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:42.861
Arkin’s always like that.
You’d think he’s lazy,

00:29:42.861 --> 00:29:45.739
but the truth is,
he’s really smart.

00:29:46.615 --> 00:29:48.771
Sometimes I even
get jealous of him because

00:29:48.796 --> 00:29:52.884
I really have to put in effort
just to get passing grades.

00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:55.787
Arkin’s actually amazing.
He’s special.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:01.633
You like playing with
makeup or dolls, right?

00:30:03.965 --> 00:30:07.552
Jeez, I am so sleepy.

00:30:11.848 --> 00:30:13.141
Chips again?

00:30:13.934 --> 00:30:15.060
It’s so early for junk food.

00:30:15.602 --> 00:30:17.145
Don’t be like them.

00:30:17.562 --> 00:30:19.189
You weren’t like this before.

00:30:19.814 --> 00:30:21.733
Honestly, you’ve
gotten really fat.

00:30:22.404 --> 00:30:24.447
Haven’t you seen your body
in the mirror lately?

00:30:24.472 --> 00:30:27.767
And your eating habits too,
tone it down, please.

00:30:27.822 --> 00:30:29.491
Am I really getting fat?

00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:34.394
Wow, this guy’s unbelievable.

00:30:34.419 --> 00:30:36.922
Controlling and a body-shamer.

00:30:36.947 --> 00:30:39.157
I really don’t like
Luna’s boyfriend.

00:30:45.129 --> 00:30:48.049
Are you that Samantha who’s been
spreading rumors about me?

00:30:49.604 --> 00:30:50.605
What?

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:52.089
Don’t “what” me.

00:30:52.254 --> 00:30:52.973
You’re such a drama queen,

00:30:52.973 --> 00:30:54.391
and I don’t plan on
gossiping about it!

00:30:54.416 --> 00:30:56.184
Why are they fighting?

00:30:56.184 --> 00:30:57.477
If you have nothing good to say,

00:30:57.477 --> 00:30:59.020
keep your mouth shut, okay?

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.147
I didn’t do anything wrong.
What’s wrong with you?

00:31:01.147 --> 00:31:02.649
What’s wrong with you!

00:31:05.258 --> 00:31:06.968
Are you okay? You all right?

00:31:10.991 --> 00:31:12.660
Yeah, I’m okay.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.917
That’s Yanna.

00:31:15.412 --> 00:31:16.913
There’s gossip about her

00:31:17.455 --> 00:31:20.583
making out with
someone behind the gym.

00:31:20.922 --> 00:31:22.257
It kinda seems true though.

00:31:24.337 --> 00:31:26.214
They say she’s the daughter
of a former adult star.

00:31:26.214 --> 00:31:27.955
Looks like she’s following
in her mom’s footsteps.

00:31:30.109 --> 00:31:31.486
What’s so funny about that?

00:31:32.053 --> 00:31:33.116
Huh?

00:32:24.052 --> 00:32:25.721
You want some water?

00:32:28.211 --> 00:32:29.712
Have some.

00:32:43.538 --> 00:32:44.601
I’ll get going—

00:33:08.775 --> 00:33:12.034
Wow, no one makes
fishballs like you, sir!

00:33:12.059 --> 00:33:16.889
For real,
his kikiam is the best.

00:33:16.914 --> 00:33:19.367
Sir, can I get four
pieces, please?

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:21.371
Thanks.

00:33:21.913 --> 00:33:25.208
I’ll have one more
stick of fishballs, sir.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.293
Via!
Let me have some.

00:33:27.919 --> 00:33:28.920
Come on, give me some.

00:33:32.215 --> 00:33:35.300
Kino, this is Luna and Kierra.

00:33:35.325 --> 00:33:37.327
Luna, Ke, this is Arkin,
my best friend.

00:33:37.452 --> 00:33:39.329
Hi, best friend!

00:33:39.481 --> 00:33:40.566
Hello, groupmates.

00:33:41.682 --> 00:33:43.759
You know, you’re handsome.

00:33:43.784 --> 00:33:45.160
You look like a child star.

00:33:45.185 --> 00:33:47.354
- So cute!
- Hey!

00:33:59.401 --> 00:34:00.860
Via!

00:34:01.494 --> 00:34:03.324
He pinched me.

00:34:03.349 --> 00:34:04.013
What’s wrong with you?

00:34:04.038 --> 00:34:06.124
- Why’d you pinch Luna?
- Is it red?

00:34:07.344 --> 00:34:09.221
I thought it’s okay to get even.

00:34:09.246 --> 00:34:11.248
Luna’s turning red.
See, it’s your fault.

00:34:11.296 --> 00:34:12.504
You keep pinching
people for no reason,

00:34:12.529 --> 00:34:13.863
now you got payback.

00:34:13.888 --> 00:34:14.931
I’m sorry.

00:34:14.966 --> 00:34:17.594
Sorry, Luna. I’ll just
buy you some fishballs.

00:34:17.594 --> 00:34:18.219
Just a piece.

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:19.137
What do you mean,
just a piece?

00:34:19.137 --> 00:34:20.930
Your friend’s such a cheapskate.

00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:21.931
Buy all of this.

00:34:24.058 --> 00:34:25.727
You two are kinda cute.

00:34:26.019 --> 00:34:28.188
You’re always together, like
a buy one take one deal.

00:34:30.398 --> 00:34:31.900
See? They really are cute.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.276
Bro, what’s up?

00:34:33.651 --> 00:34:35.820
Fifty pesos worth
of kwek-kwek, please.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:36.926
Sure.

00:34:38.114 --> 00:34:39.115
Who are you?

00:34:40.825 --> 00:34:42.035
And who are you?

00:34:48.915 --> 00:34:51.125
Hey, freshman,
your cheeks are turning red.

00:34:51.874 --> 00:34:55.896
Really? Is it that obvious?

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:00.261
It’s kinda cute, actually.

00:35:02.055 --> 00:35:04.057
How about this, bro?
Is it obvious?

00:35:04.057 --> 00:35:05.158
Is it cute, too?

00:35:05.183 --> 00:35:06.851
You look like a tomato, man.

00:35:10.063 --> 00:35:11.481
I’m Sevi, by the way.

00:35:12.315 --> 00:35:13.149
Sevi—

00:35:13.149 --> 00:35:14.108
Sevi Camero.

00:35:14.108 --> 00:35:16.608
The one our classmate
has a crush on—

00:35:16.633 --> 00:35:20.303
Kierra, Luna, Via,
and Via’s best friend.

00:35:20.406 --> 00:35:21.991
Arkin.

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:26.204
Come on now, lend us
fifty bucks of that.

00:35:26.621 --> 00:35:27.872
Sir, give these kids something.

00:35:27.872 --> 00:35:28.748
- You heard that?
- Wow,

00:35:28.748 --> 00:35:30.083
- He’s treating us.
- give us some extra.

00:35:30.083 --> 00:35:30.986
Sure thing!

00:35:31.793 --> 00:35:33.044
Bro, get us the expensive one.

00:35:33.795 --> 00:35:34.963
Sure, I got this.

00:35:34.963 --> 00:35:35.964
He said he’s got it, Via.

00:35:35.964 --> 00:35:36.923
I don’t want any!

00:35:36.923 --> 00:35:38.675
You’re not the only one
who’ll be treating me now.

00:35:40.888 --> 00:35:43.515
Finally, it’s the last
week of school.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.367
Where are you
spending your summer, Via?

00:35:45.473 --> 00:35:46.891
Probably just at home.

00:35:46.891 --> 00:35:48.810
We still have volleyball
training at the club.

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:50.687
What if I joined
the volleyball club too?

00:35:50.687 --> 00:35:52.146
Then I’d be really
good at spiking,

00:35:52.146 --> 00:35:54.107
and you can call me Ace.

00:35:54.511 --> 00:35:55.799
Let me try, come on.

00:35:55.824 --> 00:35:56.825
I’ll show you, okay?

00:35:56.985 --> 00:35:57.986
Look at this.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.571
So it’s like this first, right?

00:36:00.571 --> 00:36:02.490
Then like this, right?

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:03.568
- Yeah?
- And then—

00:36:06.469 --> 00:36:07.493
Oh no, Via!

00:36:08.871 --> 00:36:09.539
Oh no!

00:36:09.539 --> 00:36:10.707
Oh my god, Via!

00:36:10.707 --> 00:36:13.960
- Hey! Hey!
- Via, I’m so sorry, Via!

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.879
I told you, you really shouldn’t
join the volleyball team!

00:36:16.879 --> 00:36:18.256
No, it’s fine. I’m fine.

00:36:18.256 --> 00:36:19.299
- Via?
- I’m really sorry.

00:36:19.299 --> 00:36:20.717
Via, Via! Via!

00:36:20.942 --> 00:36:22.194
- What happened to you?
- No, I’m okay.

00:36:22.218 --> 00:36:23.278
You’re bleeding, there’s blood!

00:36:23.303 --> 00:36:24.387
Are you sure you’re okay?

00:36:24.387 --> 00:36:25.430
I’m fine, really.

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:26.180
Can you stand up?

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.557
- You can’t even stand!
- I’m standing.

00:36:27.557 --> 00:36:28.474
- What hurts?
- I said I’m standing.

00:36:28.474 --> 00:36:30.143
How many fingers? How many?

00:36:30.143 --> 00:36:30.893
Ten.

00:36:30.893 --> 00:36:32.812
Oh no, she’s dumb now!

00:36:32.812 --> 00:36:34.439
I need to take
you to the clinic.

00:36:34.439 --> 00:36:36.816
I’ll hit you ten times
if you don’t stop!

00:36:36.816 --> 00:36:38.401
I said I’m fine!

00:36:38.401 --> 00:36:39.027
I’m fine!

00:36:39.027 --> 00:36:40.194
Via, you’re not fine!
You need—

00:36:40.194 --> 00:36:41.571
I’m taking you
to the clinic, come on.

00:36:41.571 --> 00:36:42.530
Where’s—

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:43.531
Where’s the clinic?

00:36:43.786 --> 00:36:44.585
Via, don’t—

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:45.591
Don’t close your eyes,
don’t close them.

00:36:45.616 --> 00:36:47.285
Via, I’m so sorry!
I didn’t mean for this—

00:36:47.285 --> 00:36:48.536
You just had
to try spiking, huh!

00:36:48.536 --> 00:36:49.329
I’m not playing
volleyball ever again!

00:36:49.329 --> 00:36:50.330
This way could’ve been better.

00:36:52.782 --> 00:36:54.784
Arkin: Via i’ll pick you up
after my class.

00:36:54.809 --> 00:36:55.936
Arkin: Are you okay?

00:36:56.332 --> 00:36:58.876
Via: I’m fine.
It didn’t hit anything vital!

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:38.856
Is she being bullied?

00:38:20.978 --> 00:38:22.522
What the heck!
You’re in the way.

00:38:22.547 --> 00:38:24.257
I’m sorry. Are you crying?

00:38:24.549 --> 00:38:25.716
What do you care?

00:38:26.092 --> 00:38:28.191
- Attention-seeking bitch.
- Wait, aren’t you—

00:38:34.892 --> 00:38:36.436
Hey, I’m Samantha.

00:38:37.497 --> 00:38:38.696
Do you know that girl?

00:38:40.148 --> 00:38:41.482
I don’t know her.

00:38:43.252 --> 00:38:44.265
I see.

00:38:44.861 --> 00:38:46.022
Thank you.

00:39:02.202 --> 00:39:03.411
Does it still hurt?

00:39:05.718 --> 00:39:07.011
It’s really red.

00:39:08.487 --> 00:39:09.903
Are you even
a volleyball player?

00:39:09.927 --> 00:39:13.055
You keep looking around, that’s
why you got hit by the ball.

00:39:13.281 --> 00:39:15.042
You’re being so dramatic.

00:39:15.283 --> 00:39:17.929
I already said I’m fine,
it doesn’t hurt.

00:39:17.954 --> 00:39:20.499
Guess I shouldn’t have
let you sleep over tonight.

00:39:20.669 --> 00:39:21.706
Me?

00:39:21.731 --> 00:39:24.212
I’m literally here to take care
of you because you’re injured.

00:39:24.684 --> 00:39:25.851
Jeez.

00:39:27.867 --> 00:39:29.030
By the way,

00:39:29.902 --> 00:39:32.613
I’m joining the photojournalism
club next school year.

00:39:33.832 --> 00:39:35.668
They liked the shots I took.

00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:40.002
You’re joining two clubs?

00:39:40.027 --> 00:39:41.139
Yes.

00:39:41.616 --> 00:39:44.452
Aside from music,
I like cameras too.

00:39:44.986 --> 00:39:47.822
And so I can be there
during your games.

00:39:48.232 --> 00:39:51.793
Photographers usually get sent
to cover school events, right?

00:39:52.303 --> 00:39:55.306
They didn’t let me join the
girls’ volleyball team anyway,

00:39:55.306 --> 00:39:59.185
so I’ll just take pictures of
you looking dumb for my edits.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:02.211
You really found another
way to annoy me, huh?

00:40:04.532 --> 00:40:07.660
And you? Maybe you wanna
join another club too.

00:40:08.192 --> 00:40:09.777
Come on, join the music club.

00:40:10.527 --> 00:40:12.320
So we can be together there.

00:40:13.354 --> 00:40:15.565
Can’t you live without me?

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:16.831
Nope.

00:40:19.368 --> 00:40:21.894
I don’t want to join two clubs.
I’m fine with volleyball.

00:40:28.673 --> 00:40:31.884
That’s a shame, they won’t
get to hear your voice.

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.594
Goodnight, Via.

00:40:35.628 --> 00:40:36.629
Goodnight, Kino.

00:40:55.406 --> 00:40:59.779
Hey guys, I’m running for
second-year student rep

00:40:59.977 --> 00:41:01.520
in the student council.

00:41:01.545 --> 00:41:02.463
Yeah!

00:41:02.488 --> 00:41:04.907
So you’re into politics now?

00:41:04.932 --> 00:41:06.976
Of course! And like they say,

00:41:07.003 --> 00:41:10.131
you have to be active
in school activities.

00:41:10.131 --> 00:41:11.048
They also said,

00:41:11.048 --> 00:41:13.151
make the most out
of your high school life.

00:41:15.177 --> 00:41:19.390
Come on, be part of
my campaign team, please?

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.142
- I’m in.
- You’re in?

00:41:21.142 --> 00:41:22.893
Hey, Via. You too, okay?

00:41:22.893 --> 00:41:25.396
I saw the poster you made,

00:41:25.396 --> 00:41:26.647
and I was like, it’s so good!

00:41:26.647 --> 00:41:29.692
I really wish you’d make
my campaign poster too.

00:41:29.692 --> 00:41:32.987
Don’t worry, there’s
a little extra incentive.

00:41:33.279 --> 00:41:34.405
Come on, please?

00:41:34.441 --> 00:41:35.341
Sure, why not.

00:41:35.366 --> 00:41:36.564
Thank you!

00:41:39.136 --> 00:41:41.680
You see that good-looking
guy walking over there?

00:41:41.979 --> 00:41:43.397
That’s Acel.

00:41:43.422 --> 00:41:45.216
He’s running for president,

00:41:45.241 --> 00:41:46.576
and I’m under his partylist.

00:41:46.601 --> 00:41:50.771
The VP running with him is Sevi.

00:41:50.796 --> 00:41:52.004
Yeah, Sevi.

00:41:52.088 --> 00:41:54.588
That's a sure win.
He’s handsome.

00:41:54.938 --> 00:41:57.440
Yeah, but it’s not just that,
his platform’s really good too.

00:41:57.876 --> 00:42:00.513
Who else is running
under Acel’s party?

00:42:01.643 --> 00:42:04.938
I heard it’s a third-year rep,
I think… Samantha Vera?

00:42:06.584 --> 00:42:07.413
- Samantha, huh…
- Yeah, she’s running.

00:42:07.438 --> 00:42:08.648
I’m so excited, girl!

00:42:08.673 --> 00:42:10.791
It’s gonna be like
a beauty showdown.

00:42:10.816 --> 00:42:12.109
I’m really excited.

00:42:13.861 --> 00:42:15.112
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:42:15.946 --> 00:42:17.114
Why weren’t you replying?

00:42:18.282 --> 00:42:19.617
We were doing research.

00:42:19.642 --> 00:42:20.576
Research?

00:42:20.576 --> 00:42:21.624
Yes.

00:42:21.786 --> 00:42:23.579
Looks more like you
were just gossiping.

00:42:23.987 --> 00:42:25.196
What were you talking about?

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:26.791
Well—

00:42:26.791 --> 00:42:29.502
Right, I just remembered.

00:42:30.032 --> 00:42:33.105
Yanna! Remember her, babe?

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:34.090
Yes.

00:42:34.115 --> 00:42:35.700
The one I told you about before.

00:42:35.725 --> 00:42:39.219
She got caught again making out
with someone at the fire exit.

00:42:39.553 --> 00:42:41.013
People were gossiping
about her earlier,

00:42:41.013 --> 00:42:44.684
then the guy’s
girlfriend slapped her.

00:42:45.309 --> 00:42:46.477
- Yes.
- Poor thing.

00:42:46.477 --> 00:42:47.853
She’s such a flirt, huh?

00:42:47.853 --> 00:42:49.772
Probably because she’s the
daughter of an adult actress.

00:42:49.772 --> 00:42:50.780
Hey!

00:42:51.524 --> 00:42:53.025
That’s mean.

00:42:53.491 --> 00:42:55.576
Why does he hate
Yanna so much?

00:42:58.364 --> 00:42:59.115
Why are you looking
at me like that?

00:42:59.115 --> 00:43:00.758
You’ve been glaring
this whole time.

00:43:00.783 --> 00:43:02.159
Hey, Lance!

00:43:02.159 --> 00:43:03.222
What?

00:43:03.369 --> 00:43:07.164
Via! Give me my lunch.
I’m starving.

00:43:07.164 --> 00:43:08.457
Lunch box.

00:43:10.042 --> 00:43:11.252
- You know,
- Lunch box.

00:43:11.252 --> 00:43:13.337
you should be the
one carrying this.

00:43:13.337 --> 00:43:14.964
- All right, go eat.
- Thank you.

00:43:14.964 --> 00:43:16.215
Bye-bye.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.681
Bye-bye.

00:43:23.681 --> 00:43:25.349
Bye-bye!

00:43:30.963 --> 00:43:35.009
Guys, thanks for the time and
ideas you shared for our campaign.

00:43:36.251 --> 00:43:38.711
I can see I made the right
choice picking this team.

00:43:41.543 --> 00:43:44.588
Yeah, so let’s give it our
best in the coming days.

00:43:44.613 --> 00:43:46.657
Yes!

00:43:48.981 --> 00:43:51.400
Your speech is
making me emotional, Pres.

00:43:52.236 --> 00:43:53.321
I really hope

00:43:54.353 --> 00:43:55.854
we win.

00:43:56.547 --> 00:44:00.351
And when that happens, Pres is
treating us to some snacks!

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:05.645
All right. All right, then.

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:07.254
Fine. I’ll treat everyone,
I promise.

00:44:07.279 --> 00:44:09.448
But for now, meeting adjourned.

00:44:09.819 --> 00:44:10.644
Thank you.

00:44:10.644 --> 00:44:12.813
Thank you, Pres.

00:44:12.813 --> 00:44:16.108
- Bye!
- Bye!

00:44:16.108 --> 00:44:16.734
Take care!

00:44:16.734 --> 00:44:18.360
Bye, everyone.

00:44:20.483 --> 00:44:21.532
Have you eaten yet?

00:44:21.557 --> 00:44:22.558
Not yet.

00:44:22.583 --> 00:44:24.126
Why? Are you treating us?

00:44:24.151 --> 00:44:25.329
What do you want to eat?

00:44:26.426 --> 00:44:28.053
Guys, I’ll go ahead, okay?

00:44:29.031 --> 00:44:30.191
Samantha!

00:44:31.332 --> 00:44:32.333
Just call me Sam.

00:44:32.333 --> 00:44:34.794
Sam, come eat with us.

00:44:34.794 --> 00:44:36.754
There’s a grill place outside.

00:44:36.754 --> 00:44:40.591
They’ve got chicken feet,
grilled intestines,

00:44:40.591 --> 00:44:42.722
and grilled blood. It’s really
good. Have you tried it?

00:44:42.747 --> 00:44:44.957
Do you eat grilled blood?
Do you know what that is?

00:44:46.055 --> 00:44:47.723
What? Grilled blood?

00:44:47.723 --> 00:44:50.454
Hi, big sis. I’m Luna.

00:44:52.164 --> 00:44:54.375
I’m the candidate for
second-year representative.

00:44:55.227 --> 00:44:57.730
Yeah. I heard in the
meeting earlier.

00:44:57.755 --> 00:44:59.214
You know what, just call me Sam.

00:44:59.543 --> 00:45:00.627
She’s speaking English!

00:45:00.652 --> 00:45:04.448
Ke! Ke! Back me up.
Let’s switch!

00:45:04.473 --> 00:45:06.600
What? I’m not ready.
Vice, you go!

00:45:10.246 --> 00:45:11.372
Good afternoon.

00:45:11.988 --> 00:45:13.865
How are you?
I’m fine, thank you.

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:16.995
Are you a foreigner?
Do you have dollars?

00:45:17.702 --> 00:45:19.787
I’m not a foreigner. Are you?

00:45:20.381 --> 00:45:21.799
You look so tall.

00:45:23.968 --> 00:45:26.345
Bro, she called me a foreigner.

00:45:26.345 --> 00:45:28.180
For real though,
do I look like a foreigner?

00:45:28.422 --> 00:45:29.448
No.

00:45:29.473 --> 00:45:30.641
She’s just flattering you.

00:45:30.666 --> 00:45:31.875
Come on, let’s go.

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:35.825
Your boyfriend’s
flirting with me, by the way.

00:45:36.605 --> 00:45:39.525
Can you please
put a leash on your pet?

00:45:40.239 --> 00:45:41.323
I didn’t know.

00:45:42.423 --> 00:45:44.273
That’s why I’m telling you.

00:45:44.697 --> 00:45:46.949
Believe it or not,
it’s up to you.

00:45:47.241 --> 00:45:48.784
I’ve done my part.

00:45:51.692 --> 00:45:52.693
Wow, fun times!

00:45:52.718 --> 00:45:54.595
The campaign
hasn’t even started yet,

00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:56.330
and there’s drama already!

00:46:03.507 --> 00:46:04.925
Samantha Vera. Give it to them.

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:08.871
Samantha Vera, third-year rep.
She’s nice. Super nice.

00:46:09.222 --> 00:46:11.641
Bro, you’ve got
something on your cheek.

00:46:12.683 --> 00:46:13.851
I’m already helping him and he—

00:46:13.851 --> 00:46:15.144
Don’t vote for him!

00:46:15.144 --> 00:46:18.022
He’s got a terrible attitude!

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:42.650
- They’re here.
- There they are.

00:46:43.397 --> 00:46:45.274
Class, listen to them first.

00:46:45.299 --> 00:46:46.800
Good day, everyone.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.135
I’m Acel.

00:46:50.351 --> 00:46:51.978
And I’m Sevi.

00:46:52.003 --> 00:46:54.497
Yes, and we are
the Ray of Light Partylist.

00:47:00.414 --> 00:47:01.123
Okay—

00:47:01.148 --> 00:47:02.922
If you vote for us,

00:47:02.947 --> 00:47:05.575
we’ll be with you
every step of the way.

00:47:05.945 --> 00:47:08.113
Guys, the Ray of Light
Partylist supports you.

00:47:08.113 --> 00:47:09.266
Right, Sevi?

00:47:09.448 --> 00:47:10.451
Right!

00:47:10.866 --> 00:47:13.702
Once you vote for us,
we’ll take care of you.

00:47:13.727 --> 00:47:14.900
Okay?

00:47:15.048 --> 00:47:16.424
We are the
Ray of Light Partylist.

00:47:16.449 --> 00:47:17.993
Ray of Light Partylist, let’s go!

00:47:22.461 --> 00:47:24.338
- Hey!
- Guys, water.

00:47:24.713 --> 00:47:26.256
Here, Sevi.

00:47:29.134 --> 00:47:30.886
- You want some? Want some?
- Have some water.

00:47:30.886 --> 00:47:32.137
Looks like you already ate some,
that part’s missing.

00:47:32.137 --> 00:47:33.097
You’re being dramatic.

00:47:33.097 --> 00:47:34.098
You want some, Sevi?

00:47:34.098 --> 00:47:34.682
Yummy!

00:47:34.682 --> 00:47:36.684
- Via!
- This is my favorite.

00:47:41.123 --> 00:47:42.249
Lance: We need to talk.

00:47:42.274 --> 00:47:44.985
You know what, even the rice
Via cooks tastes good.

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:46.595
Wow!

00:47:47.528 --> 00:47:49.405
Campaigning is so tiring.

00:47:50.322 --> 00:47:52.074
It’s worth it. We’re gonna win.

00:47:52.074 --> 00:47:53.409
Please vote for Sam Vera!

00:47:55.035 --> 00:47:56.704
Wait, you’ve been frowning
for a while now.

00:47:57.019 --> 00:47:58.062
What’s wrong?

00:47:58.087 --> 00:47:59.264
- Is it because of—
- Luna!

00:47:59.289 --> 00:48:00.332
Speaking of—

00:48:00.332 --> 00:48:01.000
Speak of the devil.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.877
Luna, are you really planning
on not talking to me?

00:48:04.503 --> 00:48:06.588
Luna, that Yanna’s
the one flirting with me,

00:48:06.588 --> 00:48:07.564
not the other way around.

00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:09.800
She keeps chatting and
messaging me nonstop.

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.571
I’ve been ignoring her, okay?

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.804
Come on, Luna, we’ve been
together for two years.

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:16.015
You think I’d cheat on you now?

00:48:17.057 --> 00:48:19.393
Don’t tell me you actually
believe her over me?

00:48:20.276 --> 00:48:25.196
Yanna said you invited her
to your house?

00:48:25.319 --> 00:48:26.320
Huh?

00:48:27.174 --> 00:48:28.425
And you believed her?

00:48:29.555 --> 00:48:31.849
I don’t even invite anyone over.

00:48:31.874 --> 00:48:33.292
Her, of all people? No way.

00:48:33.407 --> 00:48:35.919
That girl’s just
obsessed with me.

00:48:36.213 --> 00:48:39.133
She’s doing everything she can
to ruin what we have.

00:48:41.184 --> 00:48:42.244
What’s so funny?

00:48:42.269 --> 00:48:43.270
Nothing.

00:48:43.834 --> 00:48:45.669
- I asked you, what’s so funny?
- Hey!

00:48:45.669 --> 00:48:46.128
- What’s your problem?
- You jerk—

00:48:46.128 --> 00:48:47.129
She’s being a bitch.

00:48:47.129 --> 00:48:48.714
- Let go of Via!
- She’s such a bitch.

00:48:57.556 --> 00:48:58.557
Let go.

00:49:12.279 --> 00:49:13.280
Via…

00:49:13.614 --> 00:49:15.532
I’m really sorry. I’m so—

00:49:15.908 --> 00:49:17.701
Huh? What are you
saying sorry for?

00:49:17.701 --> 00:49:18.994
You didn’t do anything wrong.

00:49:18.994 --> 00:49:19.870
I’m sorry too.

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:21.538
I couldn’t stop myself.
I’m sorry.

00:49:21.538 --> 00:49:22.446
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:49:22.471 --> 00:49:24.890
Don’t worry anymore.
Just forget about that jerk.

00:49:24.958 --> 00:49:26.627
By the way,
Acel’s calling you guys.

00:49:26.627 --> 00:49:27.711
He said he’s treating us.

00:49:27.711 --> 00:49:29.755
Hallelujah! I’m starving!

00:49:29.755 --> 00:49:30.964
- Let’s go.
- Come on!

00:49:30.964 --> 00:49:32.800
- Let’s go.
- Via…

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.009
Hey, let’s post some here.

00:49:34.426 --> 00:49:35.552
I’m really sorry, okay?

00:49:35.552 --> 00:49:36.608
It’s fine, really.

00:49:40.099 --> 00:49:42.142
Okay. Guys, I brought
some soft drinks.

00:49:42.142 --> 00:49:43.268
- Hey! Thanks, Pres!
- Who doesn’t have any drinks?

00:49:43.268 --> 00:49:44.228
- Thanks, Pres.
- All good.

00:49:44.228 --> 00:49:45.771
- I got mine.
- You, Sam? Whose is this?

00:49:45.771 --> 00:49:47.231
Here, you want some more?

00:49:47.231 --> 00:49:49.316
No, Pres. I’ll just
have water later.

00:49:49.316 --> 00:49:49.942
You sure?

00:49:49.942 --> 00:49:51.068
- Yeah. Thanks.
- You’re really nice, Pres.

00:49:51.068 --> 00:49:52.778
Via, here’s one for you.

00:49:52.778 --> 00:49:54.029
Is this normal—

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.281
Thanks, Pres.

00:49:57.324 --> 00:49:58.325
Of course.

00:49:59.728 --> 00:50:02.072
He’s so caring
toward other people.

00:50:02.514 --> 00:50:05.517
You know what, I think we
don’t have utensils yet.

00:50:05.542 --> 00:50:06.209
I’ll go grab some real quick.

00:50:06.234 --> 00:50:07.611
Wait. I’ll help you, Pres.

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:09.460
Let’s go!

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.426
- Five pairs, okay?
- Five? Okay.

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:20.456
So even college students
come here too?

00:50:20.481 --> 00:50:21.815
Okay, done.

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:26.436
You took so long.

00:50:26.802 --> 00:50:28.345
Sorry. I’m sorry, guys.

00:50:30.691 --> 00:50:31.859
Hello.

00:50:31.859 --> 00:50:33.235
Hey.

00:50:35.324 --> 00:50:36.700
Don’t give Sevi since he’s
going to use his hands to eat.

00:50:36.725 --> 00:50:37.935
Do they know each other?

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.128
Oh, okay!

00:50:39.158 --> 00:50:40.242
Guys!

00:50:40.242 --> 00:50:41.451
Sorry I took a while.

00:50:41.451 --> 00:50:42.536
- This is yours, Arkin.
- It’s okay.

00:50:42.953 --> 00:50:44.079
Here.

00:50:44.079 --> 00:50:45.038
- Here you go, Sam.
- Thank you.

00:50:45.038 --> 00:50:46.123
Here’s more.

00:50:47.141 --> 00:50:49.017
- Need help?
- Hold on, Via first.

00:50:49.042 --> 00:50:50.111
Okay.

00:50:50.894 --> 00:50:53.147
That’s three pieces.
Different flavors.

00:50:53.172 --> 00:50:55.424
- Finish them all!
- That’s a lot,

00:50:55.424 --> 00:50:57.301
I can’t finish them.

00:50:57.534 --> 00:51:00.871
Why? You only ate
a little at lunch, didn’t you?

00:51:00.971 --> 00:51:02.139
Make sure to eat properly.

00:51:02.139 --> 00:51:03.974
And you, on the other hand,
only drink soft drinks.

00:51:03.974 --> 00:51:05.100
Drink some water.

00:51:05.764 --> 00:51:06.518
Are you guys always like that?

00:51:06.518 --> 00:51:07.895
Like a married couple, bro.

00:51:13.233 --> 00:51:14.943
- We’re just friends.
- What’s your relationship?

00:51:14.943 --> 00:51:15.736
Friends?

00:51:15.736 --> 00:51:16.830
Childhood.

00:51:27.164 --> 00:51:28.165
Luna.

00:51:32.814 --> 00:51:34.338
Luna, are you okay?

00:51:35.797 --> 00:51:38.133
Look, I don’t mean to pry,

00:51:38.133 --> 00:51:39.927
but you should just leave him.

00:51:41.178 --> 00:51:43.513
You should take care
of yourself, Luna.

00:51:44.139 --> 00:51:48.977
Yeah. Honestly, I’ve never felt
good about that guy.

00:51:48.977 --> 00:51:50.729
I’ve had a bad feeling
about him since before.

00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:00.989
Excuse me.

00:52:02.074 --> 00:52:03.367
Let’s eat somewhere else.

00:52:03.825 --> 00:52:04.660
Let’s go.

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:06.912
KJ, I’m really craving
for chicken, you know?

00:52:07.955 --> 00:52:10.457
Come on, we’re blocking the way.

00:52:10.457 --> 00:52:12.417
That’s enough, let’s go.

00:52:12.417 --> 00:52:13.043
Luna.

00:52:13.043 --> 00:52:14.336
What happened?
Why are you crying?

00:52:14.336 --> 00:52:15.963
Is it because of your boyfriend?

00:52:16.713 --> 00:52:18.465
Forget him,
I already know he’s ugly

00:52:18.465 --> 00:52:19.800
even if I haven’t met him.

00:52:20.842 --> 00:52:22.427
Luna, don’t cry, okay?

00:52:22.427 --> 00:52:24.429
Don’t cry over that bastard.

00:52:24.429 --> 00:52:25.553
He’s ugly.

00:52:27.975 --> 00:52:31.186
What happened? Is it about
that Lance guy again?

00:52:34.648 --> 00:52:35.649
That jerk.

00:52:36.066 --> 00:52:41.029
So don’t ever crush
on guys like that, okay?

00:52:42.823 --> 00:52:43.824
I would never.

00:52:53.292 --> 00:52:55.794
We’re blocking the way, come on.

00:52:55.794 --> 00:52:59.131
That’s enough. Just let him go.

00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:04.594
This whole week
has been exhausting.

00:53:04.594 --> 00:53:06.054
I agree.

00:53:07.556 --> 00:53:10.559
I just hope they finish
tallying the votes soon.

00:53:10.851 --> 00:53:13.812
I really want to know
if my bets won.

00:53:14.146 --> 00:53:18.066
But I’ve got a strong feeling
Luna’s party is going to win.

00:53:20.444 --> 00:53:22.571
Hey, are you okay?

00:53:23.864 --> 00:53:26.074
I think I’m going
to break up with him.

00:53:26.783 --> 00:53:28.493
Really?
You’re actually doing it?

00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:34.858
Yeah, I feel like it’s a good
thing I saw everything that happened.

00:53:35.208 --> 00:53:36.835
I saw how toxic he really is.

00:53:38.663 --> 00:53:41.333
Finally, Luna’s come
to her senses.

00:53:41.798 --> 00:53:43.270
Hey! What the hell?

00:53:43.302 --> 00:53:45.763
Take back everything you
said about my girlfriend.

00:53:45.788 --> 00:53:47.873
Because of you, we’re not
even talking anymore.

00:53:48.155 --> 00:53:51.199
Why should I?
I only told her the truth.

00:53:51.224 --> 00:53:54.728
You’re the one who should stop
spamming me with texts.

00:53:54.728 --> 00:53:58.732
Your flirting is getting annoying,
I’m not even into you.

00:53:58.732 --> 00:54:02.110
Wow, out of all the people
you’ve fooled around with,

00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:03.403
I’m the one you don’t like?

00:54:04.321 --> 00:54:06.448
Quit pretending.

00:54:07.199 --> 00:54:10.285
For all I know,
you want a taste of me, too.

00:54:11.119 --> 00:54:12.746
You’ve got some nerve!

00:54:12.954 --> 00:54:14.623
I haven’t even
kissed anyone yet!

00:54:14.915 --> 00:54:16.456
Here, let me give you
your first kiss then.

00:54:17.417 --> 00:54:18.752
- You’re disgusting!
- Luna!

00:54:18.752 --> 00:54:20.087
- So disgusting!
- Hey, Luna!

00:54:20.087 --> 00:54:21.922
- What the heck?
- You’re disgusting!

00:54:21.922 --> 00:54:22.923
- Luna!
- You’re disgusting!

00:54:22.923 --> 00:54:24.966
- Luna, that’s enough!
- You’re disgusting!

00:54:28.765 --> 00:54:29.847
Yanna!

00:54:31.348 --> 00:54:32.265
Out of the way!

00:54:32.265 --> 00:54:33.225
Stop!

00:54:33.433 --> 00:54:34.518
- What the—
- Move! Luna…

00:54:34.518 --> 00:54:36.853
- Babe! She’s the one—
- Hey, don’t you listen?

00:54:36.853 --> 00:54:38.522
Didn’t I tell you
to leave Luna alone?

00:54:38.522 --> 00:54:40.440
You perverted trash,
that’s what you are!

00:54:41.343 --> 00:54:41.942
Bitch—

00:54:41.942 --> 00:54:43.443
What did you say? Trash?

00:54:43.443 --> 00:54:45.195
- Yeah, I said you’re trash.
- Huh?

00:54:45.195 --> 00:54:46.270
Trash, huh?

00:54:46.571 --> 00:54:47.406
I’m trash?

00:54:47.406 --> 00:54:48.454
Yes!

00:54:48.573 --> 00:54:49.866
You fucking bitch!

00:55:49.384 --> 00:55:52.971
♪ You’re mine… ♪

00:56:01.329 --> 00:56:03.292
I felt Arkin kick.

00:56:03.317 --> 00:56:05.611
Me too, Via kicked.

00:56:06.306 --> 00:56:07.849
You two…

00:56:09.283 --> 00:56:11.465
I think they liked our music.

00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:12.866
I think so, too.

00:56:13.825 --> 00:56:14.868
I’m getting kinda hungry.

00:56:14.868 --> 00:56:16.620
Same here, and
I really need to pee.

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:18.121
Let’s rest for a bit.
Break time, guys.

00:56:18.121 --> 00:56:19.194
Yeah, break time.

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.626
Why do you keep
following me around?

00:56:22.626 --> 00:56:25.795
Because we’re best friends.

00:56:28.465 --> 00:56:31.301
We should always stay together.

00:56:31.301 --> 00:56:32.302
Why?

00:56:32.302 --> 00:56:35.347
Because you’re my first friend.

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:53.823
Guys, I have good news!

00:56:54.199 --> 00:56:56.451
We just signed a new contract!

00:56:59.079 --> 00:57:01.164
- Thank you so much!
- Guys!

00:57:01.915 --> 00:57:04.042
All right, snacks on me, guys!
Let’s celebrate!

00:57:04.042 --> 00:57:06.127
You came just in time.
Cheers!

00:57:43.873 --> 00:57:45.458
You waited for me again?

00:57:46.126 --> 00:57:47.168
Didn’t I tell you?

00:57:47.168 --> 00:57:50.380
We go to school together
and leave together.

00:57:52.638 --> 00:57:53.848
You don’t have a choice.

00:57:54.217 --> 00:57:55.218
You’re so clingy.

00:57:55.243 --> 00:57:56.536
Super clingy.

00:57:57.137 --> 00:57:59.306
How was training? You tired?

00:57:59.841 --> 00:58:00.677
Yeah.

00:58:00.702 --> 00:58:01.494
Yeah?

00:58:01.519 --> 00:58:02.592
I’m tired.

00:58:02.851 --> 00:58:03.938
You’re tired?

00:58:04.394 --> 00:58:05.395
Okay then.

00:58:05.979 --> 00:58:07.522
Come, hop on.

00:58:08.456 --> 00:58:10.166
- What?
- Get on.

00:58:10.191 --> 00:58:12.193
- No way.
- Hurry up.

00:58:12.193 --> 00:58:13.403
I said no way.

00:58:13.403 --> 00:58:14.446
I’ll lie down right here
if you don’t get on.

00:58:14.446 --> 00:58:15.938
- No! Don’t
- I’m really gonna lie down.

00:58:15.963 --> 00:58:17.078
I said no. Stop!

00:58:17.338 --> 00:58:18.783
Get up. I don’t wanna.

00:58:18.783 --> 00:58:20.368
- Come on.
- No.

00:58:20.393 --> 00:58:21.519
Whatever.

00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:23.371
Get up.

00:58:23.705 --> 00:58:24.706
Stand up.

00:58:25.993 --> 00:58:27.028
Still tired?

00:58:27.139 --> 00:58:28.780
- Am I heavy?
- No.

00:58:28.805 --> 00:58:30.747
- Am I heavy?
- I can carry two of you.

00:59:07.290 --> 00:59:10.105
Why did you have to fight, Kino?

00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:11.770
You want me to just stand
there while that jerk

00:59:11.795 --> 00:59:12.921
had you by the collar?

00:59:13.963 --> 00:59:15.340
Does it still hurt?

00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:24.444
We only have three weeks left
before Foundation Day, guys.

00:59:25.067 --> 00:59:25.934
Hey, Yanna!

00:59:25.934 --> 00:59:28.564
You’re joining
the Miss Valerian pageant.

00:59:28.589 --> 00:59:30.383
You don’t have a choice anymore,
I signed you up.

00:59:30.939 --> 00:59:32.148
Go ahead.

00:59:32.941 --> 00:59:35.527
I knew I’d find you here.

00:59:43.076 --> 00:59:44.285
There.

00:59:44.744 --> 00:59:45.745
See?

00:59:45.745 --> 00:59:46.955
Why do you look so red?

00:59:46.955 --> 00:59:47.914
Let me see.

00:59:47.914 --> 00:59:48.707
- Huh?
- Do you have a fever?

00:59:48.707 --> 00:59:50.041
You feel warm.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.044
It’s kinda hot in this room.

00:59:53.044 --> 00:59:54.546
- Huh?
- I think the fan’s—

00:59:54.546 --> 00:59:56.147
No, the aircon’s on.

00:59:56.172 --> 00:59:57.173
Hi, Arkin.

01:00:00.593 --> 01:00:02.679
Kino, do you have a crush?
