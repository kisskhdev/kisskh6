(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:47.755
What's your real reason for approaching me?

00:00:56.135 --> 00:00:57.135
It was you, wasn't it?

00:00:57.565 --> 00:01:00.065
You're the one who tried to kill my husband 20 years ago.

00:01:01.405 --> 00:01:02.405
It was a mistake.

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:07.075
I should have finished him off back then.

00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:12.215
Well, that's an interesting way to confess.

00:01:12.715 --> 00:01:14.285
If Park Je Yeol had died back then,

00:01:14.955 --> 00:01:18.255
you wouldn't be going through this either.

00:01:27.465 --> 00:01:29.395
You filed a sexual assault report, didn't you?

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:32.235
Ten months before your child's birth.

00:01:33.905 --> 00:01:34.905
Shut it.

00:01:34.975 --> 00:01:38.605
But the report was withdrawn, and Park Je Yeol got what he wanted.

00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:44.685
Right.

00:01:45.115 --> 00:01:46.715
You should have just killed him back then.

00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:48.685
You don't know anything.

00:01:49.015 --> 00:01:53.525
You don't know what he's like, or what I go through to survive.

00:01:54.295 --> 00:01:56.725
You think I haven't tried anything all this time?

00:01:57.025 --> 00:02:00.025
I did. I tried everything I could,

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:01.735
but I failed.

00:02:03.835 --> 00:02:05.035
I'll get you out of there.

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:08.975
I said I'd help you. That was our deal, wasn't it?

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:14.615
- If a lawyer was all it took... - Here.

00:02:15.475 --> 00:02:18.945
This is your key out of your fiery pit.

00:02:27.225 --> 00:02:28.525
(Episode 6)

00:02:28.595 --> 00:02:30.395
Don't get up. Stay right there.

00:02:31.965 --> 00:02:32.965
Wait.

00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:34.895
- Honey. - Yes?

00:02:34.965 --> 00:02:36.265
I'm not an invalid, you know.

00:02:38.365 --> 00:02:39.565
Right.

00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:43.075
I was just worried the smell would make you feel sick.

00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:46.775
So, should we order something?

00:02:47.245 --> 00:02:49.975
Sure. Order whatever you're craving.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:51.545
Here you go.

00:02:54.015 --> 00:02:55.115
Let me see.

00:02:57.555 --> 00:03:01.225
Honey, by the way, how's that new case you're on going?

00:03:02.095 --> 00:03:03.355
You know, the reinvestigation.

00:03:07.165 --> 00:03:09.095
- Hyun Jin. - Yes?

00:03:10.735 --> 00:03:12.905
It's nothing. Let me clear this away.

00:03:13.205 --> 00:03:14.705
Just rest until the food arrives.

00:03:15.205 --> 00:03:17.875
- I'm seriously ordering everything. - Go ahead, order it all.

00:03:18.445 --> 00:03:19.575
Everyone does it like this.

00:03:20.345 --> 00:03:23.275
- No, it's definitely him. - No, it's not. Look closer.

00:03:23.815 --> 00:03:26.485
Mom, Dad's driving me crazy.

00:03:26.845 --> 00:03:29.955
No matter how many times I tell him, he can't tell Minje and Keiju apart!

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:33.925
- Is that the one with orange hair? - Gosh, you're seriously hopeless.

00:03:35.295 --> 00:03:36.295
Did you have dinner?

00:03:36.855 --> 00:03:38.925
She already ate with me. You're late.

00:03:39.225 --> 00:03:40.765
Yes. Work ran late.

00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:45.605
Just plug it into Park Je Yeol's phone.

00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:49.505
And you can make him disappear from your life for good.

00:03:51.005 --> 00:03:53.205
Mom.

00:03:54.415 --> 00:03:56.575
- Yes? - I said I want some fruit.

00:03:56.915 --> 00:03:59.215
What's with you? Did you run into someone?

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:02.285
It's nothing. Wait, I'll get you a mango.

00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:06.685
- Dad, this is the last time. - Okay, I got it.

00:04:06.755 --> 00:04:08.855
- I'll explain again. Watch. - Okay.

00:04:15.435 --> 00:04:16.495
Hey, Shin Jae.

00:04:16.835 --> 00:04:18.005
How did it go?

00:04:18.535 --> 00:04:19.905
I said what I had to say.

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:22.035
As long as Hong Yeon Hui does her part,

00:04:22.375 --> 00:04:25.475
we can be the ones to take down Park Je Yeol.

00:04:26.745 --> 00:04:29.445
Proof that the Connect app exists. On top of that,

00:04:29.545 --> 00:04:31.815
if we have proof of Park Je Yeol's involvement,

00:04:32.785 --> 00:04:34.015
we can blow this whole thing wide open.

00:04:34.385 --> 00:04:39.155
You'll add the abuse charge and not give him any room to breathe?

00:04:39.585 --> 00:04:41.355
Only if Ms. Hong Yeon Hui agrees to it.

00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:45.495
You think Attorney Kwon will just sit back and let this happen?

00:04:45.795 --> 00:04:48.235
Don't worry. I won't let him hold us back.

00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:50.605
Did you eat dinner?

00:04:52.305 --> 00:04:54.775
Just grabbed a bite on my way in. Are you calling about work?

00:04:54.935 --> 00:04:58.045
No. I just called because I wanted to hear your voice.

00:04:58.805 --> 00:05:00.845
What's gotten into you?

00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:07.715
I'm happy we're going to be aunts,

00:05:08.055 --> 00:05:09.985
but I was worried you might be lonely at night.

00:05:14.395 --> 00:05:15.455
Get some sleep.

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:50.255
I've been thinking.

00:05:51.125 --> 00:05:53.895
I think it's best if I just go to work.

00:05:55.435 --> 00:05:58.335
If you're at the office, you'll keep running into Attorney Kwon.

00:05:58.405 --> 00:05:59.905
And he might recognise you.

00:06:00.265 --> 00:06:03.605
It didn't seem like he recognised me last time.

00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:09.075
And I enjoyed it. Working at your office, I mean.

00:06:11.585 --> 00:06:15.285
It may not be a big deal to others, but it was a first for me.

00:06:16.255 --> 00:06:17.725
Working in an office.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:24.365
If that's what you want, Min Seo, let's do that.

00:06:28.835 --> 00:06:30.435
Min Seo, wait a second.

00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:37.575
Here, I saw this and thought of you.

00:06:48.785 --> 00:06:50.315
(Chocolate milk)

00:06:58.765 --> 00:07:00.835
What are you doing up? Aren't you sleeping?

00:07:01.365 --> 00:07:03.035
I was just about to.

00:07:03.435 --> 00:07:06.505
- You look tired. Go to bed. - Okay.

00:07:07.805 --> 00:07:09.835
- Sang A. - Yes?

00:07:13.845 --> 00:07:16.145
Never mind. Good night.

00:08:41.035 --> 00:08:43.065
(That livestream just now...)

00:08:48.035 --> 00:08:49.135
(You saw it? So cute.)

00:08:51.045 --> 00:08:53.475
(So...)

00:08:53.645 --> 00:08:54.775
(how was your day?)

00:08:59.345 --> 00:09:02.655

(Senior Prosecutor's Office, Senior Prosecutor Park Je Yeol)

00:09:28.315 --> 00:09:30.475
Any breakthroughs after just one day?

00:09:34.485 --> 00:09:35.755
Take this case back.

00:09:38.355 --> 00:09:40.325
That's disappointing.

00:09:41.225 --> 00:09:43.495
Aren't you waving the white flag a bit too soon?

00:09:43.855 --> 00:09:46.565
I'm already overloaded with my current cases.

00:09:48.235 --> 00:09:51.465
Or is it because you're scared?

00:09:52.205 --> 00:09:54.105
Scared this might be Pandora's box.

00:09:56.905 --> 00:10:00.245
Do you think Hyun Jin was the one who did that to you?

00:10:00.675 --> 00:10:02.845
I gave you the case so you could find that out.

00:10:05.215 --> 00:10:07.485
You were the one who sent me the newspaper article too, right?

00:10:08.415 --> 00:10:10.615
Why did you drag me into this in the first place?

00:10:10.925 --> 00:10:15.325
Do you want to catch the culprit, or do you want to hurt Hyun Jin?

00:10:17.795 --> 00:10:19.325
What if it's both?

00:10:26.005 --> 00:10:27.135
This was your doing, wasn't it?

00:10:30.175 --> 00:10:31.445
Listen to me very carefully.

00:10:33.045 --> 00:10:35.015
If anything like this ever happens to Hyun Jin again,

00:10:35.815 --> 00:10:36.945
I really won't let it slide.

00:10:42.255 --> 00:10:43.315
Detective Gu Seon Kyu.

00:10:48.025 --> 00:10:49.155
You do realise, don't you?

00:10:49.795 --> 00:10:52.065
That you just covered up an attempted murder.

00:10:52.995 --> 00:10:56.695
You're not the only detective in the world, are you?

00:10:57.605 --> 00:10:58.605
I wonder.

00:10:59.465 --> 00:11:01.105
When it's proven that I was right,

00:11:01.875 --> 00:11:03.175
what you'll do then.

00:11:07.275 --> 00:11:08.275
If that happens,

00:11:09.445 --> 00:11:10.645
I'll give up my badge myself.

00:11:40.875 --> 00:11:41.915
This is amazing!

00:11:43.045 --> 00:11:45.185
I can't. It's so beautiful.

00:11:46.945 --> 00:11:48.215
It's adorable.

00:11:48.815 --> 00:11:50.885
I didn't know if it would be a boy or girl, so I chose yellow.

00:11:51.525 --> 00:11:54.125
I wanted to be first to get a gift for my future niece or nephew.

00:11:57.565 --> 00:11:59.325
Thank you.

00:12:00.565 --> 00:12:02.135
I bet Seon Kyu is thrilled, right?

00:12:02.595 --> 00:12:06.565
Actually, we're both still in a bit of a daze.

00:12:06.635 --> 00:12:10.505
Maybe it'll start to feel real after our hospital appointment.

00:12:11.275 --> 00:12:15.145
Hope it goes well. See that Seon Kyu treats you to something delicious.

00:12:15.345 --> 00:12:18.745
I will. But this is seriously so cute.

00:12:34.365 --> 00:12:36.235
Where are the paper cups?

00:12:38.205 --> 00:12:39.365
The cups...

00:12:48.075 --> 00:12:49.075
Here you go.

00:12:50.615 --> 00:12:51.645
Thank you.

00:12:53.745 --> 00:12:56.215
I don't think I've seen you around here before.

00:12:58.155 --> 00:13:02.025
- I just started recently. - Is that right?

00:13:02.755 --> 00:13:03.755
Keep up the good work.

00:13:18.645 --> 00:13:21.045
I was the one who hired Han Min Seo.

00:13:21.775 --> 00:13:23.475
How can you fire her without any reason?

00:13:24.685 --> 00:13:27.985
Her resume has only one line on it. High school dropout.

00:13:28.715 --> 00:13:31.685
Do we need to screen for education for a simple part-time job?

00:13:31.785 --> 00:13:32.985
Is there a reason we shouldn't?

00:13:34.795 --> 00:13:38.765
Or what? Is there some other reason I can't?

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:44.605
I'm in charge here now. An employee with her bad history.

00:13:44.735 --> 00:13:46.005
I've never kept someone like that on my staff.

00:13:48.705 --> 00:13:51.475
Is that so? This is a first for me too.

00:13:51.875 --> 00:13:54.175

Are you heading home? I'll give you a ride.

00:14:15.835 --> 00:14:17.495
Let her. She wants to.

00:14:17.905 --> 00:14:18.905
Yes, ma'am.

00:14:22.605 --> 00:14:24.445
Read this on the way.

00:14:30.115 --> 00:14:32.385
It's a sex trafficking scandal involving high-profile figures.

00:14:32.445 --> 00:14:34.915
And there are minors among the exploited victims.

00:14:36.015 --> 00:14:38.425
There's circumstantial evidence linking it to at least two murders.

00:14:41.295 --> 00:14:43.855
Now you're playing detective?

00:14:44.925 --> 00:14:45.925
So?

00:14:47.165 --> 00:14:50.765
What's your point? Are you asking for a bigger budget?

00:14:50.995 --> 00:14:54.305
Attorney Kwon is involved. As a client.

00:14:55.835 --> 00:14:56.905
What are you going to do?

00:15:00.145 --> 00:15:03.045
Who else knows about this case?

00:15:03.245 --> 00:15:05.485
Right now, only the three of us know.

00:15:07.045 --> 00:15:08.255
Then bury it.

00:15:11.055 --> 00:15:12.255
That's an order.

00:15:13.255 --> 00:15:18.065
If what you say is true, more clients might be involved,

00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:22.135
and if this gets to the authorities, our stance is clear.

00:15:22.435 --> 00:15:24.535
We will stand by our clients.

00:15:25.135 --> 00:15:28.905
So Attorney Kwon won't have to worry, will he?

00:15:31.105 --> 00:15:35.415
This won't pose any risk at all.

00:15:36.545 --> 00:15:38.815
As expected, your scales of justice have never...

00:15:40.215 --> 00:15:42.755
tipped in favour of those without money and power.

00:15:43.085 --> 00:15:46.225
That's my definition of justice. The winning side.

00:15:46.625 --> 00:15:47.955
Still, I was hoping...

00:15:48.995 --> 00:15:50.525
that you'd get rid of Attorney Kwon.

00:15:51.265 --> 00:15:55.235
That you'd side with what's right, not what's powerful.

00:15:55.995 --> 00:15:58.505
Just like the vain hopes you always have for me.

00:15:59.305 --> 00:16:00.905
It's all so futile and pointless.

00:16:03.135 --> 00:16:04.135
I'm done.

00:16:14.285 --> 00:16:16.685
My kind of justice has no place at Haeil, Mom.

00:16:17.355 --> 00:16:18.455
I'm getting out here.

00:16:33.305 --> 00:16:34.305
This is Kang Shin Jae.

00:16:35.105 --> 00:16:36.305
We need to meet today.

00:16:43.275 --> 00:16:46.185
You can hear that, right? That's the baby's heartbeat.

00:16:46.845 --> 00:16:48.715
It looks like you're about eight weeks along.

00:16:49.315 --> 00:16:50.355
Eight weeks?

00:16:50.785 --> 00:16:54.695
But I had my period during that time.

00:16:54.755 --> 00:16:58.165
That's a common mistake for first-time mothers.

00:16:58.265 --> 00:17:00.025
It was most likely implantation bleeding.

00:17:02.535 --> 00:17:04.565
Excuse me, Doctor.

00:17:07.835 --> 00:17:08.905
Heroin?

00:17:09.335 --> 00:17:13.745
Yes. At eight weeks, she was already pregnant.

00:17:13.945 --> 00:17:18.615
- Will the baby be okay? - I can't be sure it had no effect.

00:17:19.615 --> 00:17:21.285
To be frank,

00:17:21.785 --> 00:17:24.985
in a normal case, the risk would be so high...

00:17:25.255 --> 00:17:27.025
that I would've advised you to consider your options.

00:17:28.655 --> 00:17:33.125
But the baby is growing well for its gestational age.

00:17:33.195 --> 00:17:35.065
Let's just keep a close watch for now.

00:17:36.895 --> 00:17:38.865
I'll be sure to keep a close eye on it.

00:17:40.865 --> 00:17:43.575
This baby really is a miracle.

00:17:45.975 --> 00:17:50.915
- A miracle? - The hysterosalpingogram was fine,

00:17:51.285 --> 00:17:54.484
but your test results, sir,

00:17:54.485 --> 00:17:56.215
showed under 1 percent normal morphology.

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:59.455
Your sperm count and motility were also extremely low.

00:18:00.485 --> 00:18:01.625
What does that mean?

00:18:02.195 --> 00:18:05.965
Statistically, with these numbers, natural conception is impossible.

00:18:06.065 --> 00:18:10.535
I was going to recommend IVF, but thankfully...

00:18:10.595 --> 00:18:11.605
Wait a second.

00:18:12.065 --> 00:18:14.005
Did you just say natural conception was impossible?

00:18:14.465 --> 00:18:15.875
But then how...

00:18:15.975 --> 00:18:19.645
That's just from a statistical standpoint.

00:18:20.345 --> 00:18:23.545
It's rare, but miracles like this do happen.

00:18:32.685 --> 00:18:34.225
You had a nice chat with my wife?

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:41.025
To think I wouldn't know whatever you're planning...

00:18:41.395 --> 00:18:42.735
is just so arrogant.

00:18:44.465 --> 00:18:46.705
Then again, some things never change.

00:18:47.105 --> 00:18:48.575
That's your charm, isn't it, Yoon Ra Young?

00:18:49.835 --> 00:18:51.375
It makes it all the more thrilling...

00:18:52.475 --> 00:18:53.705
when I finally get to break you.

00:19:06.755 --> 00:19:08.695
I'm so glad you got your memory back.

00:19:10.155 --> 00:19:13.725
If you never remembered, I would've felt so wronged.

00:19:14.265 --> 00:19:18.935
Don't you want to know? Who made this app,

00:19:19.765 --> 00:19:21.035
and who else was involved.

00:19:23.075 --> 00:19:24.375
Go public with it.

00:19:24.875 --> 00:19:26.545
Tell them you tried to kill someone.

00:19:27.905 --> 00:19:32.715
And for 20 years, you kept silent pretending to be a man of justice.

00:19:33.545 --> 00:19:37.255
Confess to the world you're ready to pay for your sins.

00:19:39.225 --> 00:19:40.355
Beg before me.

00:19:41.455 --> 00:19:42.995
Then I'll tell you.

00:19:43.595 --> 00:19:44.965
About Connect.

00:19:46.025 --> 00:19:47.995
Everything you want to know.

00:19:50.395 --> 00:19:52.335
If you can't, then stop. Right now.

00:19:54.005 --> 00:19:55.075
Who knows?

00:19:56.575 --> 00:19:58.005
Maybe I'll even forgive you.

00:20:05.545 --> 00:20:06.545
Really?

00:20:08.315 --> 00:20:09.555
But what a shame.

00:20:10.785 --> 00:20:12.825
Because there's no way I'll ever forgive you.

00:20:15.495 --> 00:20:17.055
The one who hasn't fully paid for their sins...

00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:19.465
is you.

00:20:56.995 --> 00:20:58.605
Sorry, I have to get back inside.

00:20:59.135 --> 00:21:01.335
- Okay. - See you later.

00:21:21.255 --> 00:21:22.455
This is driving me crazy.

00:21:23.895 --> 00:21:25.195
This is absolutely insane.

00:21:39.305 --> 00:21:40.775
Hello, this is Hwang Hyun Jin.

00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:42.745
Isn't this Lee Jun Hyeok's phone?

00:21:44.515 --> 00:21:45.515
Excuse me?

00:21:46.285 --> 00:21:48.554
- Who? - Lee Jun Hyeok.

00:21:48.555 --> 00:21:50.115
That's what it says here.

00:21:50.715 --> 00:21:51.785
What does that...

00:21:54.085 --> 00:21:55.125
A laptop?

(Computers and Laptops)

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:09.275
But how did you get my number?

00:22:09.505 --> 00:22:13.045
If you can't reach me, please call this number instead.

00:22:13.975 --> 00:22:15.045
I'll give you the files.

00:22:15.545 --> 00:22:18.045
I've changed my mind. Be at my place by 8pm.

(Victim Testimonies, Research, Evidence, Tips)

00:22:22.015 --> 00:22:23.355
(Tips)

00:22:36.235 --> 00:22:37.365
It's ransomware.

00:22:38.165 --> 00:22:41.505
This isn't like a regular virus. Without the key, it's unrecoverable.

00:22:42.075 --> 00:22:44.975
Is there no way to fix it? These files are really important,

00:22:45.275 --> 00:22:46.505
and this is all I have left.

00:22:47.105 --> 00:22:48.175
Please, do everything you can.

00:22:48.515 --> 00:22:50.345
Yes, I'll see what I can do.

00:22:50.545 --> 00:22:52.715
(Lee Jun Hyeok)

00:22:53.815 --> 00:22:57.455
- Did you recover the files? - I couldn't recover everything.

00:22:57.515 --> 00:23:00.024
I salvaged some of your files from a restore point.

00:23:00.025 --> 00:23:01.055
That's why I called.

00:23:05.895 --> 00:23:06.995
It's Yoon Ra Young.

00:23:07.595 --> 00:23:10.165
I'm at the park outside your place. Can you come out for a minute?

00:23:10.765 --> 00:23:13.405
Park Je Yeol found out that we met.

00:23:55.975 --> 00:23:58.345
- Excuse me. - Mom's taking a shower.

00:23:59.345 --> 00:24:00.615
Then the message...

00:24:01.215 --> 00:24:03.255
Did you send it?

00:24:09.095 --> 00:24:12.265
- I'm a friend of your mom's. - I know who you are.

00:24:12.895 --> 00:24:14.125
I saw you on TV.

00:24:15.035 --> 00:24:17.935
Do you want to help my mom?

00:24:19.605 --> 00:24:21.565
Yes.

00:24:22.435 --> 00:24:24.235
Then don't contact her again.

00:24:25.075 --> 00:24:26.305
And don't come here either.

00:24:27.275 --> 00:24:30.415
- Wait, just let me explain... - Are you ready to be responsible?

00:24:30.915 --> 00:24:33.185
How? How far are you willing to go?

00:25:03.215 --> 00:25:04.675
("Aspiring IT Majors Triple")

00:25:04.745 --> 00:25:06.245
("And Behind It All Was Baek Tae Joo of The Prime")

00:25:15.755 --> 00:25:17.255
Sorry, the meeting ran a little late.

00:25:18.295 --> 00:25:19.525
Want to go out? We still can.

00:25:20.865 --> 00:25:23.295
I doubt we could find a better view than this anywhere else.

00:25:24.365 --> 00:25:25.605
In that case, how about a drink here?

00:25:26.765 --> 00:25:29.705
- Wine? Or whiskey? - Let's go with whiskey.

00:25:37.545 --> 00:25:40.345
So what's on the agenda for today? An honest conversation.

00:25:40.915 --> 00:25:42.915
Maybe the start of a friendship. I'd like that.

00:25:45.655 --> 00:25:47.785
My mother put a noose around my neck,

00:25:48.625 --> 00:25:50.825
but I'm going to use it as a lifeline.

00:25:51.355 --> 00:25:52.365
That's honest.

00:25:54.765 --> 00:25:55.765
I like it.

00:25:56.695 --> 00:25:58.365
What kind of lifeline can I be for you, then?

00:25:58.735 --> 00:26:00.265
I'm not going to inherit Haeil.

00:26:00.735 --> 00:26:03.335
- Are you okay with that? - With pleasure. As you wish.

00:26:04.335 --> 00:26:06.075
I want to make LnJ independent.

00:26:06.345 --> 00:26:07.775
I want it to be a non-profit foundation.

00:26:08.575 --> 00:26:11.945
And I'm guessing I won't have a say in the foundation's direction?

00:26:12.545 --> 00:26:13.545
That's the point.

00:26:15.955 --> 00:26:17.615
I've laid all my cards on the table.

00:26:18.725 --> 00:26:19.925
Now it's your turn.

00:26:20.485 --> 00:26:21.485
What do you want?

00:26:24.295 --> 00:26:28.095
I want you to stay true to your path as an attorney.

00:26:28.565 --> 00:26:30.235
As impressively as you do now.

00:26:31.595 --> 00:26:36.035
If you do, Haeil's age will soon come to an end in this country.

00:26:42.175 --> 00:26:45.315
Haeil is a legacy code that should've been removed long ago.

00:26:46.015 --> 00:26:48.345
No matter how much I try to build a new system,

00:26:48.415 --> 00:26:51.855
as long as this corrupt code exists, it will just keep causing conflicts.

00:26:52.685 --> 00:26:55.825
And you know the evils of Haeil better than I do.

00:26:58.965 --> 00:27:00.995
So what is it you really want to do?

00:27:04.695 --> 00:27:08.635
I want to overhaul the system. Wipe out all the malicious code,

00:27:09.475 --> 00:27:12.245
install a new, transparent, and fair OS,

00:27:12.305 --> 00:27:15.175
and apply an algorithm that gives everyone the same rules.

00:27:15.245 --> 00:27:16.945
That's the kind of new system I want to create.

00:27:17.645 --> 00:27:18.645
Why?

00:27:18.715 --> 00:27:21.815
Attorney, why do you defend victims instead of perpetrators?

00:27:24.785 --> 00:27:27.285
- Because it's the right thing to do - So do I.

00:27:27.655 --> 00:27:29.095
Because I believe this is the right thing to do.

00:27:29.825 --> 00:27:30.955
It's funny, isn't it?

00:27:31.625 --> 00:27:35.295
When people want more money or more power,

00:27:35.365 --> 00:27:36.835
no one asks them why.

00:27:37.465 --> 00:27:40.005
But why do we need a reason to make the world a better place?

00:27:42.205 --> 00:27:44.305
You and I want the same thing, don't we?

00:27:44.935 --> 00:27:47.705
That's why you've kept refusing to inherit Haeil.

00:27:50.745 --> 00:27:54.085
It seems we're ultimately headed to the same destination.

00:27:58.085 --> 00:27:59.625
From the very beginning,

00:28:00.855 --> 00:28:02.595
did you expect things to turn out this way?

00:28:03.755 --> 00:28:06.565
I did think we were a lot alike.

00:28:12.405 --> 00:28:13.405
All right.

00:28:14.005 --> 00:28:16.675
It looks like we're in the same boat now.

00:28:20.875 --> 00:28:22.415
Here's to a smooth engagement.

00:28:47.305 --> 00:28:51.875
Goodness. What's gotten into you? I thought you never drank.

00:28:52.975 --> 00:28:55.175
- You made it. - Hey.

00:28:55.415 --> 00:28:58.375
- Could I get a glass too? - Sure.

00:29:01.585 --> 00:29:03.685
So, is this to celebrate becoming a dad?

00:29:04.215 --> 00:29:05.925
Yes. It's pure bliss, right?

00:29:09.025 --> 00:29:10.525
It was.

00:29:11.625 --> 00:29:13.125
Now, it's a nightmare.

00:29:15.435 --> 00:29:18.065
Look at you. Did you fight with your wife?

00:29:19.205 --> 00:29:22.435
That's how they are when pregnant. They get all sensitive.

00:29:25.105 --> 00:29:29.815
- Here, buy your wife a tasty treat. - No, come on. It's fine.

00:29:29.975 --> 00:29:34.115
- No, just take it. - Come on, man. You can't afford it.

00:29:34.885 --> 00:29:37.455
You idiot. Who said this was for you?

00:29:37.715 --> 00:29:40.025
This is for my future niece or nephew.

00:29:44.195 --> 00:29:45.195
Thanks.

00:29:45.965 --> 00:29:46.965
This guy...

00:29:47.725 --> 00:29:48.765
So what'd they say at the hospital?

00:29:49.695 --> 00:29:50.695
Everything's okay, right?

00:29:52.705 --> 00:29:53.705
Yes.

00:29:57.705 --> 00:30:00.375
Gosh. It's Team Leader Jang. Hold on.

00:30:02.915 --> 00:30:03.915
Yes.

00:30:31.635 --> 00:30:33.575
(Team Leader Jang)

00:30:37.375 --> 00:30:39.845
Yes. Got it. Okay, bye.

00:30:47.625 --> 00:30:48.625
Seung Jin.

00:30:49.225 --> 00:30:51.195
- Yes? - So what did the team leader say?

00:30:51.625 --> 00:30:54.395
What else? The usual nagging, on and on.

00:30:58.595 --> 00:31:01.165
We're out of booze. Ma'am, another soju, please.

00:31:01.535 --> 00:31:02.535
Okay.

00:31:02.935 --> 00:31:04.805
You haven't touched the food. What gives?

00:31:08.945 --> 00:31:09.945
How delicious.

00:31:11.045 --> 00:31:12.045
Han Min Seo!

00:31:15.355 --> 00:31:18.615
I know you're in there! Come out! Han Min Seo!

00:31:19.485 --> 00:31:21.555
Darn it, open the door!

00:31:24.825 --> 00:31:25.865
Excuse me.

00:31:26.625 --> 00:31:28.325
What's with all the racket?

00:31:28.665 --> 00:31:31.995
What's it to you? Am I banging on your door?

00:31:37.635 --> 00:31:38.975
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

00:31:39.375 --> 00:31:40.745
That's a warm welcome.

00:31:43.475 --> 00:31:44.875
Who do you think you are, just barging in?

00:31:46.845 --> 00:31:49.655
Nice place.

00:31:52.015 --> 00:31:55.455
- Why are you here? - You kept calling and texting.

00:31:55.755 --> 00:31:56.925
You were the one making a scene, weren't you?

00:32:01.625 --> 00:32:03.795
- What's in here? - Where do you think you're going?

00:32:04.995 --> 00:32:06.005
Unbelievable.

00:32:06.465 --> 00:32:08.265
This is practically a showroom, isn't it?

00:32:13.775 --> 00:32:15.005
So pretty.

00:32:16.445 --> 00:32:18.245
The attorney is arriving any minute. Get out.

00:32:23.055 --> 00:32:24.085
What's this?

00:32:25.055 --> 00:32:27.955
What's so valuable in here that she had to hide it like this?

00:32:31.055 --> 00:32:32.055
Give it to me.

00:32:33.295 --> 00:32:35.495
You seem to have the wrong idea.

00:32:36.295 --> 00:32:39.165
You think living the high life erases who you are?

00:32:39.705 --> 00:32:41.005
Don't make me laugh.

00:32:43.035 --> 00:32:44.335
What are you looking at?

00:32:44.835 --> 00:32:48.305
Have you forgotten I took you in when you had nowhere to go?

00:32:49.875 --> 00:32:50.875
What do you think you're doing?

00:32:51.345 --> 00:32:52.545
What business is it of yours?

00:32:53.085 --> 00:32:54.815
We're just having a private conversation.

00:32:54.945 --> 00:32:57.255
A conversation? Is this how you talk to people?

00:32:57.615 --> 00:32:59.155
Get out of my house! Right now!

00:33:00.455 --> 00:33:02.055
We're not finished talking yet.

00:33:02.455 --> 00:33:05.525
Why? Wasn't selling her out to stay out of jail enough?

00:33:07.365 --> 00:33:11.665
Fine. I sold her out to Connect. So what?

00:33:11.865 --> 00:33:14.965
Who fed and clothed her when she ran away and had nothing?

00:33:15.035 --> 00:33:16.305
What's so wrong with getting paid for it?

00:33:16.635 --> 00:33:19.545
Nothing in life is free. Is that too much to ask?

00:33:19.805 --> 00:33:21.045
You were my mom.

00:33:26.085 --> 00:33:27.185
But you were still...

00:33:28.445 --> 00:33:29.715
my mom.

00:33:32.285 --> 00:33:33.325
You're crazy.

00:33:34.255 --> 00:33:35.325
That little family role-play thing...

00:33:35.795 --> 00:33:36.825
Did you really think that was real?

00:33:38.495 --> 00:33:39.795
See? This is what I'm talking about.

00:33:40.225 --> 00:33:42.635
She can't even tell the difference between a game and reality.

00:33:43.665 --> 00:33:45.135
You should be careful too, lady.

00:33:45.605 --> 00:33:48.835
Once you take her in out of pity, she'll never leave.

00:33:49.135 --> 00:33:52.205
- Get out of here right now! - All right. I'm leaving.

00:33:52.845 --> 00:33:54.645
If you pay me more?

00:33:55.715 --> 00:33:59.545
Since you're meddling with Connect, I'm too scared to even work.

00:33:59.845 --> 00:34:02.655
- So you must take responsibility. - Lee Seon Hwa!

00:34:12.395 --> 00:34:13.395
What's this?

00:34:14.265 --> 00:34:16.295
- Are you kidding me? - It's for your cab fare.

00:34:16.595 --> 00:34:17.635
Come to my office tomorrow.

00:34:21.735 --> 00:34:22.735
And if I do?

00:34:23.275 --> 00:34:24.375
How much are you going to give me?

00:34:24.735 --> 00:34:28.545
We can discuss a reduced sentence when this all goes down.

00:34:29.045 --> 00:34:30.545
You're smart enough to get the picture, right?

00:34:30.615 --> 00:34:33.415
What you need right now isn't money. It's an attorney.

00:34:34.045 --> 00:34:36.115
Or would you rather I call the cops on you?

00:34:37.155 --> 00:34:39.455
You won't get a suspended sentence this time.

00:34:59.475 --> 00:35:00.475
I'm so sorry.

00:35:01.075 --> 00:35:03.575
She barged in so suddenly, I couldn't stop her.

00:35:11.315 --> 00:35:14.385
I know it's not your fault, Min Seo. I'll take care of this.

00:35:31.375 --> 00:35:32.375
Yes.

00:35:33.705 --> 00:35:37.115
- Hi! How have you been? - Oh, my goodness. Hi, Seung Jin.

00:35:37.215 --> 00:35:39.785
Gosh! Seon Kyu, we're home.

00:35:40.145 --> 00:35:42.855
Shoes off. All right!

00:35:44.355 --> 00:35:47.955
Hey, no, you stay put. You shouldn't be straining yourself.

00:35:50.125 --> 00:35:51.125
Gosh.

00:35:53.895 --> 00:35:57.995
- Just how much did he drink? - Sorry?

00:35:58.565 --> 00:36:00.965
Let's see. He drank enough for five years.

00:36:02.935 --> 00:36:06.005
Cut him some slack for tonight. He's just excited to be a dad.

00:36:06.905 --> 00:36:08.605
Could I get a glass of water?

00:36:08.875 --> 00:36:09.915
Sure.

(Lee Jun Hyeok)

00:36:29.995 --> 00:36:31.395
Gosh, nice place.

00:36:33.765 --> 00:36:34.765
Thanks.

00:36:41.575 --> 00:36:42.575
That's much better.

00:36:43.115 --> 00:36:46.414
Thank you so much for bringing him all the way home, Seung Jin.

00:36:46.415 --> 00:36:47.745
It was nothing.

00:36:48.715 --> 00:36:49.755
Hey, listen.

00:36:50.515 --> 00:36:53.825
You really need to be careful now.

00:36:54.355 --> 00:36:58.325
- I'm sorry? - Look, I know you're tough,

00:36:58.855 --> 00:37:02.995
but you need to look after yourself and think about the baby.

00:37:04.035 --> 00:37:05.065
Right?

00:37:07.265 --> 00:37:08.505
Gosh.

00:37:09.035 --> 00:37:10.075
Just me being nosy.

00:37:10.835 --> 00:37:11.835
Just worried.

00:37:13.675 --> 00:37:14.705
I'll get going.

00:37:15.645 --> 00:37:18.815
- Thank you again. - Right. Get some rest.

00:37:18.875 --> 00:37:20.245
- Get home safe. - Sure.

00:37:21.215 --> 00:37:23.615
- Time to go. Bye. - Good night.

00:37:37.165 --> 00:37:38.165
Honey.

00:37:39.605 --> 00:37:40.605
Honey.

00:37:43.435 --> 00:37:44.905
Let's get you to bed.

00:38:39.795 --> 00:38:40.795
Mom, what are you doing?

00:38:42.395 --> 00:38:43.395
You're still awake?

00:38:51.175 --> 00:38:52.175
Sang A.

00:38:52.905 --> 00:38:53.905
Mom,

00:38:54.875 --> 00:38:56.045
don't do anything.

00:39:03.685 --> 00:39:06.655
Do you want to help my mom?

00:39:09.225 --> 00:39:12.695
Then don't contact her again. And don't come here either.

00:39:21.365 --> 00:39:22.935
Attorney Yoon?

00:39:26.505 --> 00:39:30.415
I can't sleep, so I was wondering if I could sleep here?

00:39:38.885 --> 00:39:40.785
Why did you just let her do that?

00:39:41.155 --> 00:39:42.385
She was in the wrong, not you.

00:39:43.595 --> 00:39:45.595
But she was my mom.

00:39:50.495 --> 00:39:51.565
It was the first time for me.

00:39:52.605 --> 00:39:54.165
It may have just been a game between us,

00:39:55.435 --> 00:39:58.775
but at least when I called her "Mom," she'd smile and answer me.

00:40:00.175 --> 00:40:01.905
Even when she hit me and cursed me out,

00:40:02.645 --> 00:40:04.615
she would turn right around and call me her daughter again.

00:40:08.815 --> 00:40:12.185
But I guess I was the only one who was happy...

00:40:13.025 --> 00:40:14.155
even if it was just a game.

00:40:20.565 --> 00:40:21.895
Did you ever have a child?

00:40:25.265 --> 00:40:27.835
No, never.

00:41:09.345 --> 00:41:10.345
You're still up?

00:41:12.315 --> 00:41:13.615
How long have you been sitting there like that?

00:41:15.545 --> 00:41:16.555
I'm sorry.

00:41:30.135 --> 00:41:32.835
You know what this is, right?

00:41:33.835 --> 00:41:34.935
Does this belong to the victim?

00:41:35.165 --> 00:41:36.305
We'll have to run some tests.

00:41:43.745 --> 00:41:46.915
- I have something to tell you. - Stop it.

00:41:49.585 --> 00:41:50.855
I'm not going to ask,

00:41:52.315 --> 00:41:53.425
and I'm not going to listen.

00:41:54.955 --> 00:41:56.355
I don't want to know what happened,

00:41:56.925 --> 00:41:58.325
or what you're planning to do.

00:41:59.825 --> 00:42:00.925
Don't say a single word.

00:42:02.095 --> 00:42:04.035
I'll figure this out and make my own decision.

00:42:04.495 --> 00:42:05.865
I have the right to ask for that much...

00:42:07.005 --> 00:42:08.065
don't I?

00:42:10.005 --> 00:42:11.005
Honey.

00:42:14.945 --> 00:42:16.975
I think we need some space for now.

00:42:17.775 --> 00:42:19.385
I'll stay at the office for the time being.

(Jo Yoo Jeong's Testimony and Interview)

00:42:49.415 --> 00:42:53.385
It was after I was investigated by the prosecution for theft.

00:42:54.085 --> 00:42:55.885
Someone approached me.

00:42:56.385 --> 00:42:58.215
He said it was an easy job.

00:42:58.785 --> 00:43:02.285
He promised I'd make money and also avoid punishment.

00:43:02.955 --> 00:43:05.925

I don't know his name.

But I found out later.

He was a cop.

Look at her face.

00:43:23.615 --> 00:43:26.115
She says she was sexually assaulted. By a celebrity.

00:43:27.385 --> 00:43:29.515

There's no escaping Connect.

00:43:44.835 --> 00:43:48.465
It's not just Park Je Yeol. The police are involved too.

00:46:16.485 --> 00:46:20.355
If you don't tell me the truth, you'll be the one in trouble.

00:46:21.885 --> 00:46:23.525
I've been thinking,

00:46:24.325 --> 00:46:27.695
Whatever happens later, right now, I need to put food on the table.

00:46:28.295 --> 00:46:29.995
You're not doing this to help me, are you?

00:46:30.495 --> 00:46:32.965
The information you want from me. How much is it worth to you?

00:46:33.035 --> 00:46:35.934
- Excuse me? - I require payment upfront.

00:46:35.935 --> 00:46:37.235
How much are you offering?

00:46:41.575 --> 00:46:43.015
Just wait here for a second.

00:46:49.615 --> 00:46:50.985
What is it that you want to know?

00:46:51.155 --> 00:46:53.155
Here's the kind of headline I have in mind.

00:46:53.785 --> 00:46:56.955
Lawyers at a firm known for championing the underdog...

00:46:57.555 --> 00:47:00.125
exposed as attempted murderers from their college days.

00:47:00.865 --> 00:47:02.995
Now, what if those lawyers were the heir to Haeil,

00:47:03.635 --> 00:47:07.105
a controversial celebrity lawyer, and the wife of a police detective?

00:47:07.565 --> 00:47:09.065
Don't you think that'd get a ton of clicks?

00:47:09.465 --> 00:47:12.735
So let me guess. Your source is Prosecutor Park Je Yeol.

00:47:13.345 --> 00:47:16.415
I can't reveal my sources. That's Journalism 101.

00:47:16.775 --> 00:47:19.115
You do realise we're lawyers, right?

00:47:19.445 --> 00:47:22.845
We won't stand for this kind of baseless slander.

00:47:23.485 --> 00:47:24.485
Go ahead. Write your article.

00:47:26.155 --> 00:47:27.155
But...

00:47:29.025 --> 00:47:31.755
if you're a real reporter, wouldn't you be curious?

00:47:32.555 --> 00:47:34.065
Assuming your source is correct,

00:47:35.065 --> 00:47:39.865
what could drive three young women to attack a male student?

00:47:40.635 --> 00:47:41.865
What could have possibly happened?

00:47:44.405 --> 00:47:47.305
I bet Prosecutor Park Je Yeol didn't include that part in his tip.

00:47:48.245 --> 00:47:51.815
So you're saying there was a crucial motive?

00:47:52.115 --> 00:47:55.015
I'll give you the full exclusive. But on one condition.

00:47:55.485 --> 00:47:56.485
I need time.

00:47:58.385 --> 00:47:59.385
How long?

00:47:59.855 --> 00:48:02.355
Until another story breaks first.

00:48:02.885 --> 00:48:05.155
A reporter's death framed as a sexual assault.

00:48:05.255 --> 00:48:08.925
And behind it, a digital sex ring with police and prosecutor ties.

00:48:09.625 --> 00:48:11.865
So? Are you interested?

00:48:13.305 --> 00:48:16.335
Don't tell me you're talking about the reporter Lee Jun Hyeok case.

00:48:17.205 --> 00:48:19.575
I have evidence the authorities never even got their hands on.

00:48:20.305 --> 00:48:22.375
Don't you want to break it? As an exclusive?

00:48:24.645 --> 00:48:25.675
Is this solid?

00:48:26.545 --> 00:48:29.385
Hold all your stories until we're ready.

00:48:29.855 --> 00:48:32.215
That's my condition.

00:48:36.085 --> 00:48:37.855
Are you sure about this? Laying it all out like that?

00:48:38.655 --> 00:48:41.395
We need to buy time until Hyun Jin is stable.

00:48:41.695 --> 00:48:43.365
Besides, I was planning to strike first anyway.

00:48:44.135 --> 00:48:45.135
Right.

00:48:45.835 --> 00:48:48.265
You might be right. Targeting the media first is best.

00:48:48.805 --> 00:48:51.535
And we have no idea how entangled the authorities are with Connect.

00:48:55.075 --> 00:48:56.075
Feeling sick again?

00:48:56.615 --> 00:48:57.915
Gosh, this is killing me.

00:48:59.015 --> 00:49:00.015
Who was here?

00:49:00.085 --> 00:49:02.615
A reporter. We'll tell you everything later.

00:49:14.265 --> 00:49:16.265
What about Lee Seon Hwa? Wasn't she here?

00:49:20.865 --> 00:49:21.865
The laptop...

00:49:25.335 --> 00:49:26.845
Jun Hyeok's laptop is gone.

00:49:30.415 --> 00:49:32.715
Ye Ji, have you seen Lee Seon Hwa?

00:49:32.945 --> 00:49:35.215
She left a little while ago. She said she'd come back later.

00:49:43.655 --> 00:49:45.825
- The number called is unavailable. - Any luck?

00:49:45.895 --> 00:49:47.195
Please leave a message at the tone...

00:49:47.725 --> 00:49:48.725
She's not picking up.

00:50:07.845 --> 00:50:10.055
(Mad Dog Detective)

00:50:12.255 --> 00:50:13.885
What? What do you want me to get you?

00:50:14.285 --> 00:50:15.285
The laptop.

00:50:17.825 --> 00:50:19.755
The LnJ lawyers have it right now.

00:50:20.525 --> 00:50:21.525
What are you paying?

00:50:22.365 --> 00:50:23.365
Thirty grand?

00:50:27.605 --> 00:50:28.605
Deal.

00:50:28.665 --> 00:50:30.805
(Mad Dog Detective)

00:50:35.905 --> 00:50:36.915
Mission accomplished.

00:50:37.215 --> 00:50:39.075
Funny thing. That laptop's price just went up.

00:50:39.575 --> 00:50:40.845
Thirty grand isn't going to cut it.

00:50:41.585 --> 00:50:44.815
- Fifty grand. - Fine. Just stay put.

00:50:54.395 --> 00:50:55.395
Darn it.

00:50:57.695 --> 00:51:00.065
Go get it. I don't care how.

00:51:00.805 --> 00:51:02.465
Yes, sir.

00:51:12.345 --> 00:51:13.485
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:51:14.045 --> 00:51:16.915
Prosecutor Park. Right, it's Chief Park now.

00:51:18.185 --> 00:51:19.615
This is the Prosecutor General. You know, right?

00:51:20.355 --> 00:51:21.955
It's an honour to meet you, sir.

00:51:23.895 --> 00:51:25.755
Come on, have a seat. Sit down.

00:51:28.765 --> 00:51:33.065
I arranged this because I was eager to finally meet you, Chief Park.

00:51:34.735 --> 00:51:38.305
I must say, your profile is quite impressive.

00:51:59.195 --> 00:52:00.465
A law school graduate.

00:52:00.825 --> 00:52:03.495
Your training institute scores, your performance reviews...

00:52:03.835 --> 00:52:08.835
are nothing to write home about. And going back for generations,

00:52:08.965 --> 00:52:12.675
there's not a single notable name. A classic rags-to-riches story.

00:52:14.075 --> 00:52:18.275
A guy who should have stayed local and quietly finished his career...

00:52:18.615 --> 00:52:20.845
suddenly gets on the fast track to Seoul.

00:52:21.485 --> 00:52:24.955
Then you're running reds, speeding, and cutting people off.

00:52:26.355 --> 00:52:29.185
That's not how it works. You can't just floor the gas pedal.

00:52:30.295 --> 00:52:31.325
Chief Park!

00:52:32.295 --> 00:52:34.225
How exactly do you know the Minister?

00:52:44.605 --> 00:52:47.505
I suppose he sees me as a useful workhorse.

00:52:48.105 --> 00:52:49.245
And I'm grateful for it.

00:52:52.215 --> 00:52:53.485
Allow me to pour you a drink.

00:53:00.785 --> 00:53:02.185
I will do my utmost.

00:53:13.465 --> 00:53:17.135
Prosecutor General, shall we start the night for real? What do you say?

00:53:28.015 --> 00:53:29.015
(LnJ attorney)

00:53:33.115 --> 00:53:35.055
So this is how she stabs me in the back.

00:53:37.455 --> 00:53:40.395
First, Ra Young, I need you to ask Han Min Seo about Lee Seon Hwa.

00:53:40.465 --> 00:53:41.595
Anywhere she went, anything you can find.

00:53:42.365 --> 00:53:44.695
I'll track Do Jun and Lee Seon Hwa's movements.

00:53:51.575 --> 00:53:55.145
- Hey, where are you? - Almost there. Five grand, right?

00:53:55.275 --> 00:53:56.275
Yes, that's right.

00:54:57.905 --> 00:55:00.105
The number called is unavailable. Leave a message at the tone.

00:55:02.875 --> 00:55:03.875
Excuse me.

00:55:06.375 --> 00:55:07.645
(Han Min Seo)

00:55:15.385 --> 00:55:16.455
Green hoodie?

00:56:35.505 --> 00:56:37.405
Min Seo, I'm here.

00:56:48.885 --> 00:56:49.885
Min Seo?

00:56:50.615 --> 00:56:51.615
Yes, Attorney.

00:56:54.485 --> 00:56:56.655
Can you come out for a second? I have a few questions for you.

00:57:01.725 --> 00:57:03.525
- Min Seo. - I'll be right out.

00:57:59.255 --> 00:58:03.255
(Honour)

00:58:54.875 --> 00:58:57.475
But inside, she was hiding ulterior motives.

00:58:58.015 --> 00:58:59.245
Who are you, really?

00:59:00.945 --> 00:59:02.085
Watch out.

00:59:02.145 --> 00:59:04.615
It's a shame our promise wasn't properly kept.

00:59:05.015 --> 00:59:06.185
Find them. By any means necessary.

00:59:06.815 --> 00:59:08.325
Why are you going to such lengths to hide this?

00:59:08.385 --> 00:59:09.985
There's someone on the inside. In the police force.

00:59:10.455 --> 00:59:13.155
Yoon Ra Young told me to clone your phone.

00:59:13.225 --> 00:59:14.825
What do you want me to do?

00:59:15.295 --> 00:59:16.725
The victim is here right now.

00:59:17.265 --> 00:59:21.665
Park Je Yeol killed her. Now do you see why we need that USB?
