(This story is purely fictional)

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.740
You did this?

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.260
I did.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.991
Do I pay you
to sit around and do nothing?

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.930
Do you have any idea

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.610
how much pressure I am carrying?

00:02:09.902 --> 00:02:11.690
Can you show
some sense of responsibility?

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.890
Create a bit more value for the company.

00:02:14.768 --> 00:02:15.610
I will work harder.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.060
I will fix it. I will fix it now.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.170
I thought coming from Tengda

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.450
meant you were something special.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.260
Turns out this is all you have.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.940
No wonder Tengda is going under.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.450
What nonsense is that?

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.170
That was a bit too harsh.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.450
For everyone to stay healthy,

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.450
I will keep leading exercise today.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.780
Even if we are selling fruit,

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.730
we must uphold the Tengda spirit.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.780
Uphold the spirit we have always had.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.690
Hey,

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.170
which of these two is the red apple?

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.610
This one.

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:02.610
How many times have I told you?

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.340
If you cannot tell
red from green, ask me.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.500
But I cannot tell you two apart either.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.610
Mr. Ma.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.890
I need to let you know

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.170
I have to leave early today.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.330
I need to pick up my child from school.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.260
Your eldest is already so grown.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.449
Still needs mom to pick them up?

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.850
Isn't your job tiring?

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.930
Not tiring at all.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:18.980
Working for Mr. Ma,

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.340
it is not tiring at all.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.460

Back when we were at Tengda,

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.170
I felt bookkeeping was pretty simple.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.250
Just pay money out, and that was it.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.050
How is it that now
we've opened a few stores,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.490
I can't make heads
or tails of the accounts?

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.250
It's fine.

If you can balance it, balance it.
If you cannot, then do not.

being too sentimental,

is a bit socially awkward.

did we realize

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.980

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:00.820

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:02.820
Come on.

00:14:02.991 --> 00:14:04.460
Move forward. Everyone, squeeze in.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.180

You came specifically to see me.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.460
Looks like our cooperation

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:37.980

What do you mean?

00:17:53.524 --> 00:17:55.568
The remaining payment
will be transferred to you.

00:17:55.591 --> 00:17:56.610
No need to come in person.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:57.660
I am sorry.

00:17:58.813 --> 00:18:01.013
I may have to terminate
the contract unilaterally.

00:18:08.968 --> 00:18:09.980

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.490
I know you are close with the people

at Tengda.

But I did not expect

your attachment to Tengda
to run this deep.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.220
Because you and I,

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.700

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.660

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:29.050

- No.

I am sorry, Ms. Xin.

I need you to come back
to work at Tengda.

even listen to you,

I have a solution.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.810
So you are sure
you want to sell this place?

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.050
Let me explain about the tenant.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.791
He is very satisfied
with this apartment.

00:20:02.791 --> 00:20:05.330
Once he heard you were selling,
he immediately decided to buy it.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:06.460
And the offer

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.250
is even higher than market price.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:09.250
Then sell it to him.

00:20:09.724 --> 00:20:10.460
I should tell you,

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.530
he is at home right now.

00:20:11.546 --> 00:20:13.319
When you meet him later,
have a proper talk.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.560
Once it is settled,
he can sign the contract immediately.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:26.700

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:27.860
Mr. Pei.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:32.810
I finally get to see you.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:33.860
Come on.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:34.940
Take a look inside.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:39.180
Mr. Pei.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:41.330
I heard from the agent

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:42.568
that you are selling the place,

00:20:42.613 --> 00:20:45.140
so I figured Tengda must be in trouble,

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:45.860
am I right?

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.330
But do not worry.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:48.620
With me here,

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.900
I will buy this place.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.050
Only as a temporary holding.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:56.810
Once things improve for you,

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:59.460
I will return it to you
exactly as it was.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:00.250
When that time comes,

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.490
nothing, not even office supplies,
will be missing.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.570
That is not necessary.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:08.620
Renovate it if you want.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:09.570
No need.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.010
When I first rented this place,

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.330
I did not change a thing.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:14.900
I wanted to stay here

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.090
and really take in

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:17.140
your spirit, Mr. Pei.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:19.810
Oh right.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:20.810
Except for

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.050
adding this calligraphy.

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:23.420
(This humble room may be small,
but virtue gives it worth.)

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.050
It is there to remind me at all times

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.090
to learn from you, Mr. Pei.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.290
I really like this place.

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:40.290
It gathers energy,

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.330
Mr. Pei's energy.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.380
The strongest I have ever seen.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.330
Yes.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.530
What does "humble room" really mean?

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:50.330
And what does
"virtue gives it worth" mean?

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.050
That "virtue" isn't from me.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.570
Mom, Dad, how have
you been living lately?

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:58.330
Extremely comfortable.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.660
I am telling you,
this place is wonderful.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.380

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.090
stay with you for everything.

00:22:10.391 --> 00:22:12.460

go drink your tea.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:22.530
You can sign now.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:23.180

to use that against you,

Careful. Do not peek out.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:49.810
You will get camped.

00:26:50.235 --> 00:26:51.330
Like I need you to tell me.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.140
This game has been out forever
and you are still playing it?

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.290
I am sentimental.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.770
Fair enough.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.570

Who is it?

00:28:03.524 --> 00:28:04.980
Do not come closer. Who are you?

00:28:05.013 --> 00:28:05.810
What are you doing?

00:28:07.746 --> 00:28:09.870
Come any closer and I will
throw boiling water on you.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:21.380
It is me...

Your hiking route

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.180
was ridiculously hard to find.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:32.380
It took me forever

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:33.530
to track you down.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.810
What are you doing here?

Lv...

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:46.770
I actually came to apologize.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.250
I am sorry.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:52.980
Can you forgive me?

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.010
Have some hot water.

00:29:01.368 --> 00:29:02.330
Thank you. Thank you.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:03.290
You look freezing.

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:05.140
You are really not very sturdy.

Mr. Huang Sibo?

Speaking.

00:29:25.346 --> 00:29:26.770
I am from a headhunting firm.

I have a very good

job offer

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.860
to introduce to you.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:32.700
An offer?

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:39.490
Hello.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:41.290
I'm Huang Sibo.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.010
A graduate of Wanli Academy.

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:45.460
I worked for years at game companies

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:46.460
under Fuhui Group,

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.250
and also at Tengda Games

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:49.490
and Zhongdian Web Fiction...

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:54.620
I have years of experience

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.660
as a game product manager.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:58.330
And as for

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.330
salary and compensation,

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:01.530
I have no demands.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:03.090
If the company has any difficulties,

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:04.570
I can help out, too.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:06.860
In short, I just want

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.530
a workplace that respects its employees.

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:11.180
Please

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.660
help me find a company like that.

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:14.770
Thank you.

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:18.980
Hello.

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.250
Mr. Pei?

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.140
Sibo.

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.050
I have a job offer

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:31.980
I want to give you.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.435
I don't know if you are still willing...

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.810
Mr. Pei, do you want me back at Tengda?

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.860
Back at Tengda?

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.010
Mr. Pei...

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:47.770
I...

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.090
After I left Tengda,

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:51.380
I couldn't stay

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:52.620
at any company for long.

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:57.330
I only want to work with you.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:02.940
Sibo, rest assured.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.220
This time,

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.290
I won't let you down.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:15.810
Don't lie to me.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.140
Hey,

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:20.460
which of these two is the cherry?

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:23.090
Isn't this the cherry?

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:25.570
Set one price.

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:26.570
No sorting.

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:34.730
Move them slowly.

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:35.530
Got it.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:36.290
No rush.

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:42.420
(Ponytail Fruit Shop)

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:46.460
Hey,

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:47.810
how much is the fruit?

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:49.380
Look around. Take whatever you like...

00:31:52.524 --> 00:31:53.620
Not selling to you.

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:54.380
Get lost.

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:56.860
Ma Yang.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.810
Actually, I came back this time to...

00:32:10.191 --> 00:32:11.530
Actually, this time I came back

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:14.700
to apologize to you all.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:24.900
You're a jerk.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.530
Do you think apologizing fixes anything?

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:32.010
Do you know how badly you hurt us?

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:37.080
Did you even know
that Ancient Greek Mythology book

00:32:37.146 --> 00:32:38.290
was a bootleg?

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:39.570
It is Apollo,

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:40.770
not Apineapple.

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:43.770
That box belongs to Pandora,

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:45.180
not Achilles.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.460
I told my nephew about it,

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:48.050
and he said I had no culture,

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:48.900
said I was illiterate.

00:32:48.924 --> 00:32:51.057
Every time I think about it,
I want to punch someone...

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:00.140
I am sorry.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:25.900
Why did you come back so late?

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:28.220
I have been waiting forever.

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:56.050
Hey.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:58.620
Knock first.

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:02.180
Wan.

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:03.620
Wan.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.620
Mom, Dad, go ahead and eat.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:07.700
I will grab something myself later.

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:08.570
Do not worry about me.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:10.460
No, wait.

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:11.980
Wan.

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.860
Turn on your computer and take a look.

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:15.780
That game of yours just updated.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.300
I stopped playing that game ages ago.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.860
What does it have to do with me?

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:24.610
Well then,

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:27.090
your mom and I will go eat first.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.780
Do not go hungry.

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.130
I know.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.050

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:55.980
Hello.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.010
The number you dialed is powered off.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.090

Lin Wan.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:13.780
Lin Wan!

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:15.490
What are you doing?

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:19.570
I... I am the designated driver.

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:21.940
Drivers contact clients
by phone. Got it?

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.380
Stop yelling.

Lin Wan.

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:16.490
You finally agreed
to come down and see me.

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.490
I am going for a run.

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:21.690
What?

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:24.340
Why are you running at noon?

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:38.780
Lin Wan.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.130
Did you see the update for
the Divine Mountains and Seas?

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.780
The new version you made is really good.

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:44.980
I logged back in.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:46.090
Really?

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.340
Congratulations.

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:48.860
I do not play games anymore.

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.490
Seriously? Dead again?

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.490
Lin Wan, wait for me.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:12.380
Lin Wan.

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.340
How much longer are you running?

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:15.610
You are

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.490
way too intense.

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.380
Lin Wan.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:27.690
Lin Wan.

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:29.490
Lin Wan, stop running.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:30.940
Lin Wan.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:32.380
I really cannot keep up.

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:34.610
I am exhausted.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.210
You finally stopped chasing.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:37.740
I could not run anymore either.

00:38:38.791 --> 00:38:39.980
You could not run anymore,

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.980
so why did you not stop earlier?

00:38:42.702 --> 00:38:44.130
You could not run anymore either.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:45.530
Why did you not say so sooner?

00:38:45.591 --> 00:38:46.780
I could not catch you at all.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.340
I thought you knew.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.820
How would I know if you did not say it?

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:53.610
I wanted to say it,
but I never had the chance.

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:56.130
How is there no chance?

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:57.420
Say it now.

00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:58.860
It should still be in time.

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:01.050
If I say it now,

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.650
it is still in time, right?

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:11.610
Lin Wan.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.090
I am sorry.

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:17.170
I was wrong.

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.570
From the moment I founded Tengda,

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:22.740
from start to finish,

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:24.170
it was never about a career.

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:26.650
I always treated it like a game,

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:29.860
and I never once

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.130
put my whole heart into it.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:38.490
But seeing you,

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:40.050
I finally understood.

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.780
Even if Tengda is just a game,

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:45.490
we should still take it seriously,

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:48.940
clear it together,

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:50.690
and see the ending.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:39:59.570
I am tired.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.090
What are you standing there for?

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:08.980
Go get my car.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.460
I really cannot run anymore.

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:15.090
That is easy.

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:17.570
Designated Driver Pei, back on duty.

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:18.980
