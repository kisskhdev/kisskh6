WEBVTT

00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:27.824
It’s getting too much.

00:02:29.534 --> 00:02:30.929
Even my family

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.342
is getting dragged into this.

00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:37.476
I really want to stay by your side.

00:02:40.837 --> 00:02:44.215
I really want to, but I can’t anymore.

00:02:44.924 --> 00:02:46.426
I never thought...

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.428
the day would come

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:52.265
when we’d be apart,
but here it is.

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:06.112
Throughout my life.

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.032
From now on,

00:03:09.532 --> 00:03:12.744
you’re not touching that
phone without my consent.

00:03:14.304 --> 00:03:15.388
Give it!

00:03:15.413 --> 00:03:17.165
Sir, I just won’t
wear it outside. Sir—

00:03:17.165 --> 00:03:18.328
That woman

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:20.502
will be the end of you.

00:03:21.252 --> 00:03:22.462
That woman

00:03:23.338 --> 00:03:25.840
is my beginning, sir.

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:44.586
Is the layout there okay?

00:04:46.087 --> 00:04:47.839
- Do you need anything else?
- It’s all good.

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:49.340
- Are we missing anything?
- Excuse me.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.068
Luna?

00:04:52.093 --> 00:04:52.635
Hey!

00:04:52.635 --> 00:04:53.803
Do you need anything else?

00:04:54.345 --> 00:04:55.680
Just this. It’s for you.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.640
Wait, why are you late?

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.767
I had a lot of things
to take care of at home.

00:05:01.436 --> 00:05:02.896
By the way, we’re already here.

00:05:02.896 --> 00:05:05.356
We’re just checking
the measurements.

00:05:05.356 --> 00:05:08.568
Maybe it’s time
for me to fix myself.

00:05:10.278 --> 00:05:13.239
To start over without Arkin.

00:05:15.742 --> 00:05:17.243
Even if it’s just little by little.

00:05:28.796 --> 00:05:31.966
I just focused on
gaining more experience.

00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:32.800
Via, I’m heading out
first, okay?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.718
Yeah, sure.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.511
- Take care, okay?
- Take care.

00:05:38.598 --> 00:05:41.351
I endured all the hardships
of the apprenticeship

00:05:41.893 --> 00:05:45.271
and made sure to finish
everything they assigned to me.

00:05:59.452 --> 00:06:01.788
Good thing my friends
are still with me.

00:06:02.372 --> 00:06:04.415
They make work easier to handle.

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:19.061
Before we even realized it,

00:06:19.086 --> 00:06:21.255
our apprenticeship
was almost over.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.509
- Bye, Via!
- Bye, Via!

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:57.260
- Bye, Luna!
- Bye, Luna!

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.344
- Bye, Via!
- Bye, Luna!

00:06:58.344 --> 00:06:59.762
- Bye! Take care.
- Stay safe!

00:06:59.762 --> 00:07:00.842
Bye, Luna.

00:07:03.287 --> 00:07:04.455
Are you okay?

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.459
Huh?

00:07:06.383 --> 00:07:07.593
Listen—

00:07:07.854 --> 00:07:08.604
We only have one week left

00:07:08.604 --> 00:07:12.734
to complete the
required training hours.

00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:16.487
Then, after that, there’s
still the board exam.

00:07:17.113 --> 00:07:18.698
There’s no time to rest at all.

00:07:20.324 --> 00:07:22.035
I really hope we can get through it.

00:07:22.381 --> 00:07:23.411
I mean, we can.

00:07:24.101 --> 00:07:25.686
We really can.

00:07:26.581 --> 00:07:28.332
As long as we’re together.

00:07:32.503 --> 00:07:33.584
Let’s grab a drink!

00:07:34.088 --> 00:07:35.089
Oh!

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.842
Sevi messaged.

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:39.010
Yeah.

00:07:45.558 --> 00:07:47.268
Just cry it out, Sevi.

00:07:59.655 --> 00:08:01.616
Damn, why is it like this?

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.871
Love is so unfair.

00:08:09.123 --> 00:08:10.833
You were together for years.

00:08:10.833 --> 00:08:13.503
You’ve grown used
to their presence.

00:08:14.253 --> 00:08:16.089
You went through a lot together.

00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:18.841
Then in a single moment, fuck!

00:08:18.841 --> 00:08:20.343
They just vanish?

00:08:25.807 --> 00:08:28.226
Nothing ever lasts in this world.

00:08:31.145 --> 00:08:32.772
I’m done too.

00:08:37.155 --> 00:08:40.367
You know the point when
everything’s all good…

00:08:44.408 --> 00:08:46.244
When you’re used to each other.

00:08:48.663 --> 00:08:50.039
When you’re convinced

00:08:51.666 --> 00:08:52.917
that they’re the one.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.504
This is it. They’re your person.

00:08:59.674 --> 00:09:02.802
And then somehow,
it all gets taken back.

00:09:07.682 --> 00:09:09.642
Like being happy is just hard.

00:09:18.359 --> 00:09:19.360
You know…

00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:25.016
There were so many times
I wished we had never met.

00:09:28.244 --> 00:09:30.621
I wished we never
crossed paths at all.

00:09:31.497 --> 00:09:33.100
Because if that were the case—

00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:37.336
then maybe we wouldn’t
have been tied to each other

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.076
since we were born, right?

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:43.716
Maybe I wouldn’t have

00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:47.352
hoped that we’d stay
together our whole lives,

00:09:47.377 --> 00:09:49.463
that we’d grow old together.

00:09:51.517 --> 00:09:52.768
But no.

00:09:54.446 --> 00:09:56.198
I can’t say it.

00:09:57.565 --> 00:09:58.774
Because no matter what I do,

00:09:58.774 --> 00:10:00.234
no matter
how I think about it—

00:10:01.456 --> 00:10:05.794
Every single happy
moment in my life,

00:10:07.617 --> 00:10:09.118
he was there.

00:10:14.832 --> 00:10:17.501
Shit, Arkin told me the
exact same thing last week.

00:10:21.464 --> 00:10:22.632
You were together?

00:10:24.133 --> 00:10:25.426
We met up.

00:10:26.969 --> 00:10:28.346
He even asked me,

00:10:29.305 --> 00:10:32.141
“Bro, am I a bad person?”

00:10:32.642 --> 00:10:33.976
I asked him why.

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:36.646
He said,

00:10:36.979 --> 00:10:39.440
“Why am I being
punished like this?”

00:10:39.941 --> 00:10:41.525
And then he started crying.

00:10:42.818 --> 00:10:44.737
So we went out
to see each other.

00:10:46.197 --> 00:10:47.198
But

00:10:48.908 --> 00:10:50.243
it also took him a while.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.913
It took him a long time before
he finally opened up to me.

00:10:54.455 --> 00:10:55.748
I kept thinking

00:10:56.791 --> 00:10:58.084
about how many days
he must have been carrying

00:10:58.084 --> 00:10:59.252
all that on his own.

00:11:04.674 --> 00:11:07.426
You know, I haven’t checked in
on Arkin in a long time.

00:11:08.511 --> 00:11:10.763
Sometimes I feel like
I’m such a terrible friend.

00:11:12.306 --> 00:11:14.767
Arkin wouldn’t be mad at you.

00:11:14.767 --> 00:11:18.187
Actually, he wants you guys
to be there for Via.

00:11:19.563 --> 00:11:21.607
And he keeps telling me
over and over

00:11:21.607 --> 00:11:24.068
that he hopes you
all pass the board exam.

00:11:24.068 --> 00:11:26.654
Because I told him you’ve
all been studying nonstop.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.574
You know, Via—

00:11:33.244 --> 00:11:34.745
Even though he’s hurting,

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.208
Arkin always thinks
about how you’re doing.

00:11:49.402 --> 00:11:50.403
Cheers!

00:11:52.122 --> 00:11:53.123
Cheers.

00:13:04.168 --> 00:13:05.753
One last push, Via.

00:13:06.545 --> 00:13:07.713
You’ve got this.

00:13:20.885 --> 00:13:24.640
Avianna, study hard
and really focus, okay?

00:13:24.897 --> 00:13:28.359
Get that license so
you can fly here to Spain.

00:13:31.821 --> 00:13:33.280
For the family.

00:13:55.734 --> 00:13:57.819
It’s Avi’s birthday
the weekend after next.

00:13:57.819 --> 00:13:58.945
You better be there!

00:14:04.501 --> 00:14:05.919
See you!

00:14:13.554 --> 00:14:16.604
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:21.551
♪ Happy birthday, ♪

00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:25.263
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

00:14:27.724 --> 00:14:28.975
Happy birthday!

00:14:28.975 --> 00:14:30.435
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

00:14:31.785 --> 00:14:32.905
Wow!

00:14:36.821 --> 00:14:38.323
Okay, everyone…

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:39.736
You can have your seats.

00:14:39.736 --> 00:14:41.579
And kids, you can play again.

00:14:41.604 --> 00:14:42.605
Okay?

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:43.881
Go, baby.

00:14:43.948 --> 00:14:44.937
Stay here.

00:14:45.283 --> 00:14:46.659
We have an announcement to make.

00:14:47.647 --> 00:14:48.835
Yeah.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.374
So, everyone…

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:54.584
We’d like to thank you for coming.

00:14:55.001 --> 00:14:57.962
We have an announcement
to make, as a family.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:59.631
Huh?

00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:01.049
What kind of announcement?

00:15:02.884 --> 00:15:05.470
You’ll see there are envelopes
under your plates.

00:15:16.033 --> 00:15:17.034
Oh my god!

00:15:17.273 --> 00:15:19.234
We’re getting married
in a few months.

00:15:19.692 --> 00:15:20.527
Wow!

00:15:20.527 --> 00:15:23.530
Congratulations!

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.281
Must be nice.

00:15:25.782 --> 00:15:27.202
Some people really have it all.

00:15:30.328 --> 00:15:32.205
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

00:15:40.812 --> 00:15:42.507
Via, look!

00:15:42.715 --> 00:15:44.050
Hiro… Hiro…

00:15:49.806 --> 00:15:50.807
What happened?

00:15:50.807 --> 00:15:52.267
- How are you?
- Hi!

00:15:53.184 --> 00:15:54.394
We’ll just be in the room, guys.

00:15:54.394 --> 00:15:55.562
You’ve got this!

00:15:57.185 --> 00:15:58.937
Hey, let me go.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.617
Hey, Samantha.
What time do you think it is?

00:16:09.617 --> 00:16:11.911
Sev! Sev! This is urgent.

00:16:11.911 --> 00:16:13.788
Can you please
come to the hotel?

00:16:13.788 --> 00:16:15.265
Yeah, and please take care of—

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.584
Luna! Via, ‘cause—

00:16:17.584 --> 00:16:19.210
What am I, a babysitter?

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.420
Why? What happened
over there?

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.340
Well, they’re super drunk and
I can’t look after them, so—

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.886
Damn it! I’m sure
Luna’s too far gone.

00:16:28.178 --> 00:16:30.138
Go ahead, keep drinking
until you pass out!

00:16:30.138 --> 00:16:32.474
Next time, I’ll let St. Peter
watch over her!

00:16:32.474 --> 00:16:33.766
Okay, I’ll just get ready.

00:16:33.766 --> 00:16:36.494
Yes! Thanks, Sev.
Please, please come here.

00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:37.896
Take care. No, no…

00:16:37.896 --> 00:16:40.694
- Okay! I’ll wait for you, okay?
- Oh my god.

00:16:40.719 --> 00:16:41.834
Take care!

00:16:49.998 --> 00:16:51.499
My head hurts.

00:16:52.318 --> 00:16:53.319
I need water.

00:16:55.923 --> 00:16:57.758
Good thing you’re available.

00:16:58.752 --> 00:17:00.087
Just for now.

00:17:00.667 --> 00:17:02.836
Are you sure you’re ready to see her?

00:17:05.098 --> 00:17:05.807
Yes.

00:17:05.832 --> 00:17:07.208
If you say so.

00:17:07.917 --> 00:17:09.627
You take care of Via.

00:17:10.345 --> 00:17:12.222
Sam will be checking out tomorrow anyway.

00:17:12.722 --> 00:17:14.516
Wait. I just need to grab something.

00:17:20.367 --> 00:17:21.373
Shit.

00:17:35.912 --> 00:17:37.038
Are you guys okay?

00:17:48.216 --> 00:17:50.726
I don’t want to drink anymore.

00:17:52.512 --> 00:17:54.472
You take care of this, okay?

00:17:54.472 --> 00:17:55.598
I’m leaving.

00:17:56.099 --> 00:17:57.100
Huh?

00:17:58.219 --> 00:18:00.078
Glad you’re awake, Luna!

00:18:00.103 --> 00:18:01.020
I’ll take you home.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.481
Arkin, take care of Via!

00:18:03.565 --> 00:18:06.317
- I have my car with me—
- No.

00:18:07.652 --> 00:18:08.976
I’ll go home on my own.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:10.321
Via, you’re drunk.

00:18:10.321 --> 00:18:11.281
So what?

00:18:11.531 --> 00:18:13.616
If I say I can handle it, I can.

00:18:18.566 --> 00:18:20.234
I also told myself

00:18:21.551 --> 00:18:23.303
I was ready to see you again,

00:18:23.714 --> 00:18:25.048
but I’m not.

00:18:55.476 --> 00:18:57.263
Do you really not
want this anymore?

00:19:05.976 --> 00:19:08.270
Even just the friendship, Via.

00:19:09.578 --> 00:19:10.954
Even just that.

00:19:12.794 --> 00:19:14.420
I can’t lose that, too.

00:19:18.139 --> 00:19:21.142
We already lost that the moment
you said you loved me.

00:19:22.852 --> 00:19:25.813
It got ruined the moment
I said I loved you, too.

00:19:28.358 --> 00:19:29.942
I had plans for us.

00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:32.713
Do you think I didn’t?

00:19:35.531 --> 00:19:38.701
My whole life, you were
the future I wanted.

00:19:39.869 --> 00:19:42.413
You were the one I wanted
to be with in everything.

00:19:43.304 --> 00:19:45.600
Not once did I ever
think we’d end up like this.

00:19:45.625 --> 00:19:49.003
Do you think that doesn’t hurt me?

00:19:54.082 --> 00:19:58.086
It hurts because I have to
change all those plans.

00:20:01.163 --> 00:20:02.498
We can still work on it.

00:20:04.522 --> 00:20:05.681
Can’t we?

00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:14.163
I endured these past
years without you, Via.

00:20:16.072 --> 00:20:18.199
I’m finishing out my contract.

00:20:19.242 --> 00:20:20.827
I didn’t bother you.

00:20:22.386 --> 00:20:25.097
I act happy in front
of the camera

00:20:26.086 --> 00:20:28.672
because that’s what
everyone wants, even though—

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.045
I’m completely broken inside.

00:20:35.299 --> 00:20:37.009
Is there really nothing left, Via?

00:20:41.246 --> 00:20:43.958
After your contract,
what are you going to do?

00:20:44.937 --> 00:20:47.311
Will you stop? Leave?

00:20:47.311 --> 00:20:50.231
Give up everything you worked
so hard for? For what?

00:20:51.023 --> 00:20:52.150
For who?

00:20:53.303 --> 00:20:54.471
For me?

00:20:56.446 --> 00:20:58.531
Do you think it’s really that easy?

00:21:01.033 --> 00:21:02.952
That’ll just bring you down, Arkin.

00:21:03.995 --> 00:21:04.787
And when that happens,

00:21:04.787 --> 00:21:07.248
do you really think you’ll be
able to climb back up again?

00:21:17.508 --> 00:21:19.552
The same thing that happened
to Mama will happen to you.

00:21:19.552 --> 00:21:21.262
We’re not the same, Via.

00:21:24.348 --> 00:21:28.186
So don’t look at me
like you’re afraid of me.

00:21:29.896 --> 00:21:32.440
I won’t do the things she did.

00:21:35.463 --> 00:21:37.382
I’m not like her.

00:21:38.192 --> 00:21:40.653
This isn’t the same experience
you had with your mom.

00:21:43.614 --> 00:21:46.033
You keep thinking
about my dreams.

00:21:46.746 --> 00:21:47.747
But—

00:21:48.414 --> 00:21:52.543
But you don’t even know
what your own dream really is.

00:21:53.291 --> 00:21:55.377
Because you’re
trapped in this idea

00:21:56.262 --> 00:21:59.641
that dreams only end up
ruining relationships.

00:22:14.941 --> 00:22:16.651
It already happened, didn’t it?

00:22:19.487 --> 00:22:21.447
Isn’t that exactly what happened?

00:22:22.573 --> 00:22:24.116
We’re already broken.

00:22:26.536 --> 00:22:29.330
We’re broken, I’m broken.

00:22:31.541 --> 00:22:33.042
You’re broken.

00:22:36.879 --> 00:22:39.257
I don’t want to go
back to that position.

00:22:47.024 --> 00:22:48.192
Do you love me?

00:23:04.073 --> 00:23:06.367
I wish I could say no.

00:23:15.167 --> 00:23:16.085
But even now,

00:23:16.085 --> 00:23:19.046
I still can’t lie to your face.

00:23:23.009 --> 00:23:26.137
Even knowing you’re capable
of doing all that to me.

00:23:36.063 --> 00:23:38.316
I never wanted this
to happen to us, Via.

00:23:43.117 --> 00:23:44.577
But I can still hold on.

00:23:47.199 --> 00:23:48.618
I can still endure.

00:23:51.696 --> 00:23:53.281
I can still try again.

00:23:54.065 --> 00:23:55.400
And for what?

00:23:57.835 --> 00:23:59.754
At the cost of your dreams?

00:24:00.171 --> 00:24:02.548
At the cost of everything
you worked so hard for?

00:24:04.884 --> 00:24:07.511
Larkin, you’ve already
sacrificed so much

00:24:07.511 --> 00:24:10.348
just to get to where you are now.

00:24:10.681 --> 00:24:12.251
And if you throw all of that away,

00:24:12.276 --> 00:24:14.069
I’ll be even angrier at you.

00:24:16.338 --> 00:24:18.006
And at myself.

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.031
Via—

00:24:35.117 --> 00:24:37.536
What should I do
if I see you again?

00:24:45.841 --> 00:24:47.259
Hug me.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:54.802
Then let go of me again.

00:25:33.848 --> 00:25:36.892
You know, I’ve been seeing a lot
of positive comments online.

00:25:36.892 --> 00:25:37.977
I guess it really was
a good thing

00:25:37.977 --> 00:25:39.478
you did that interview, right?

00:25:40.104 --> 00:25:42.857
People you’ve helped are
starting to speak up, too.

00:25:42.857 --> 00:25:45.901
Good! Sevi almost turned
this into a troll farm.

00:25:46.353 --> 00:25:47.396
Of course!

00:25:47.536 --> 00:25:50.271
I’m totally ready
to trash-talk those bashers,

00:25:50.296 --> 00:25:51.630
for Sam’s sake!

00:25:54.243 --> 00:25:56.245
You guys, seriously, thank you.

00:25:56.245 --> 00:25:57.747
I appreciate you all so much.

00:26:04.336 --> 00:26:05.337
Hey!

00:26:06.172 --> 00:26:07.715
Why are you so quiet, Luna?

00:26:09.633 --> 00:26:11.886
I’m just feeling a little sad.

00:26:11.886 --> 00:26:14.555
Sam’s leaving for New York,

00:26:14.555 --> 00:26:18.184
and then Via’s leaving soon, too.

00:26:18.585 --> 00:26:21.546
And I’ll be stuck with
your face every day.

00:26:22.299 --> 00:26:24.051
It’s kind of depressing, right?

00:26:24.482 --> 00:26:26.596
Oh, come on!
I’ll still visit you guys.

00:26:26.621 --> 00:26:28.164
Or come visit me.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:32.840
Auntie, why are you leaving?

00:26:32.865 --> 00:26:35.367
Will I see you soon?

00:26:35.993 --> 00:26:38.704
Baby, of course!

00:26:38.704 --> 00:26:40.081
Don’t be a bad girl, okay?

00:26:40.081 --> 00:26:42.458
Be a good girl to your
mom and your dad, okay?

00:26:42.958 --> 00:26:45.086
Okay.

00:26:47.421 --> 00:26:49.465
Hey, Yanna.

00:26:49.465 --> 00:26:51.550
Are you crying, too?

00:26:54.053 --> 00:26:56.680
I’m not used to you not being here.

00:26:59.694 --> 00:27:01.519
You’re making me cry, too.

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:03.621
Let me hold you, bestie.

00:27:03.646 --> 00:27:05.606
You’re making us all cry.

00:27:14.115 --> 00:27:15.783
We’re going to miss you, Sam.

00:27:18.285 --> 00:27:20.496
Don’t go.

00:27:20.496 --> 00:27:22.123
I have to.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.083
Visit me sometime, okay?

00:27:29.755 --> 00:27:30.923
Straight ahead, Via.

00:27:30.923 --> 00:27:32.925
So, what’s this about?

00:27:32.925 --> 00:27:35.553
This better not be some
weird surprise, okay?

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.721
- What’s this?
- Over here, Via.

00:27:37.721 --> 00:27:38.781
Where?

00:27:38.806 --> 00:27:40.007
Here, right here.

00:27:41.809 --> 00:27:43.644
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

00:27:43.644 --> 00:27:45.312
We cooked this, Ate.

00:27:45.312 --> 00:27:48.899
I made the meat stew.
Ysha made the fried spring rolls.

00:27:48.899 --> 00:27:49.900
Via, I cooked the rice,

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.569
and I also made the mango float.

00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:54.530
Wow. You guys really cooked all of this?

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.407
Of course, Via.

00:27:56.407 --> 00:27:59.326
Because when we were younger,

00:27:59.326 --> 00:28:01.745
you always cooked for us.

00:28:01.745 --> 00:28:04.373
From breakfast to dinner,

00:28:04.373 --> 00:28:07.435
even our packed lunches for school.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.628
So this time, it’s our turn.

00:28:09.628 --> 00:28:10.588
Yeah, Via.

00:28:10.588 --> 00:28:15.885
We’re really thankful for all
the sacrifices you’ve made for us.

00:28:16.197 --> 00:28:18.449
And for taking care of us, too.

00:28:21.182 --> 00:28:22.391
Oh, come on.

00:28:22.391 --> 00:28:24.894
Why are you making me cry?

00:28:26.023 --> 00:28:27.479
I don’t really know
how to cook meat stew,

00:28:27.479 --> 00:28:29.106
but the mango float is good,

00:28:29.106 --> 00:28:32.827
and I asked Papa to teach me
how to cook rice.

00:28:33.644 --> 00:28:35.813
You’re all so good now.

00:28:37.031 --> 00:28:40.075
You guys are all grown up now.

00:28:40.763 --> 00:28:45.268
At least I feel more
at ease knowing you

00:28:46.432 --> 00:28:49.018
won’t go hungry
even when I leave.

00:28:49.043 --> 00:28:51.253
Because you’ll cook.

00:28:51.451 --> 00:28:52.702
Yes.

00:28:53.172 --> 00:28:54.280
Okay, let’s sit down.

00:28:54.477 --> 00:28:55.478
Sit down, Via.

00:28:57.526 --> 00:28:58.527
Okay…

00:28:58.692 --> 00:29:00.694
You’ll take turns cooking, okay?

00:29:02.071 --> 00:29:04.740
And don’t forget Papa.

00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:06.160
Always check on him,

00:29:06.185 --> 00:29:09.855
always save him food
when he hasn’t come home yet.

00:29:09.855 --> 00:29:11.065
Always ask how he’s doing

00:29:11.065 --> 00:29:13.609
because he’s always
tired from work, okay?

00:29:19.036 --> 00:29:20.079
And you,

00:29:21.283 --> 00:29:23.118
behave yourself, okay?

00:29:23.118 --> 00:29:25.746
Don’t give your sisters a hard time.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.081
Yes, Via.

00:29:29.377 --> 00:29:31.171
Why are you crying?

00:29:31.892 --> 00:29:34.353
Because it feels like
you won’t come back.

00:29:35.422 --> 00:29:36.048
What are you talking about,

00:29:36.048 --> 00:29:39.301
I’m just reminding you
of things. I’ll still visit.

00:29:40.678 --> 00:29:43.472
I know you’re used
to me being here

00:29:43.472 --> 00:29:44.765
because since you were little,

00:29:44.765 --> 00:29:46.392
I was always the one with you.

00:29:46.934 --> 00:29:48.936
You were with me more
than with Mama, actually.

00:29:48.936 --> 00:29:50.354
But don’t worry,

00:29:51.063 --> 00:29:52.940
we’ll still talk to each other.

00:29:54.376 --> 00:29:56.419
Via, I’ll study hard, I promise.

00:29:56.444 --> 00:29:59.113
When I graduate, get a good job,

00:29:59.113 --> 00:30:01.740
and become rich, you won’t
have to work anymore, Via.

00:30:02.366 --> 00:30:03.849
Me too, Via.

00:30:03.874 --> 00:30:10.499
I promise I’ll do my best
so when I finally get a job,

00:30:10.726 --> 00:30:12.876
you can come back
here to the Philippines

00:30:13.055 --> 00:30:15.808
and we’ll all be together again.

00:30:16.255 --> 00:30:17.715
Thank you.

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:21.304
I know you’ll all do your best.

00:30:21.854 --> 00:30:24.515
I know you’ll give it
everything you’ve got,

00:30:24.919 --> 00:30:26.921
but the most important thing

00:30:27.574 --> 00:30:30.243
is don’t forget to have fun.

00:30:30.722 --> 00:30:33.183
Don’t forget to be happy.

00:30:34.004 --> 00:30:35.505
That matters, okay?

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:37.860
And if things get hard, Via,

00:30:38.427 --> 00:30:39.845
don’t keep it to yourself, okay?

00:30:40.181 --> 00:30:41.557
Let Auntie know.

00:30:42.077 --> 00:30:44.585
For now, I’ve got things
covered here.

00:30:46.218 --> 00:30:47.949
Take care of yourselves, okay?

00:30:47.974 --> 00:30:49.768
Behave, all right?

00:30:51.968 --> 00:30:52.969
Okay, that’s enough.

00:30:52.994 --> 00:30:55.455
Come on, let’s try
what you cooked.

00:30:56.253 --> 00:30:57.883
Via, I’ll get you some food.

00:30:57.908 --> 00:30:59.117
Here, have some spring rolls.

00:30:59.214 --> 00:31:01.300
- All right, let me try it.
- It’s good, Via.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.301
Everything’s good.

00:31:02.301 --> 00:31:03.360
One more?

00:31:03.385 --> 00:31:04.178
Okay.

00:31:04.341 --> 00:31:05.926
Wow.

00:31:09.975 --> 00:31:10.684
Want some meat stew?

00:31:10.684 --> 00:31:11.393
I do.

00:31:11.393 --> 00:31:12.644
- Okay.
- I cooked that.

00:31:42.148 --> 00:31:43.441
Should I bring it?

00:32:09.076 --> 00:32:10.411
Better not.

00:32:31.464 --> 00:32:32.524
Via?

00:32:35.811 --> 00:32:37.980
Sweetheart, are we taking you
to the airport tomorrow?

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:39.915
Huh?

00:32:41.374 --> 00:32:42.709
No need, Pa.

00:32:42.734 --> 00:32:44.903
We might keep on saying our goodbyes,

00:32:44.903 --> 00:32:47.531
then I’d end up missing my flight.

00:32:51.493 --> 00:32:52.501
Sweetheart…

00:32:52.953 --> 00:32:54.496
Are you mad at me?

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.954
Did I fall short somehow as a father?

00:33:05.775 --> 00:33:08.653
Pa, don’t think that way.

00:33:10.137 --> 00:33:11.847
I was never mad at you.

00:33:13.223 --> 00:33:14.391
I’ll admit,

00:33:16.249 --> 00:33:20.837
sometimes I feel hurt, sometimes
I get jealous of other kids.

00:33:22.331 --> 00:33:24.166
But I never blamed you, Pa.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.672
And even if you
never said anything,

00:33:26.697 --> 00:33:29.950
even if none of this happened,

00:33:31.241 --> 00:33:33.202
I would still take care of all of you.

00:33:36.598 --> 00:33:39.392
Your siblings and I are so
lucky to have you, sweetheart.

00:33:40.876 --> 00:33:42.503
You sacrificed so much for us.

00:33:42.503 --> 00:33:44.546
I don’t even know
how I can ever repay you.

00:33:47.344 --> 00:33:48.971
Pa, just stay healthy.

00:33:50.025 --> 00:33:51.568
Just be happy.

00:33:52.221 --> 00:33:54.097
That’s more than enough for me.

00:34:00.395 --> 00:34:01.396
Via…

00:34:02.272 --> 00:34:05.901
If it ever hurts too much,
tell me, okay?

00:34:14.868 --> 00:34:16.036
And I hope

00:34:17.621 --> 00:34:19.831
you go see Arkin to say goodbye.

00:34:21.406 --> 00:34:23.366
Not as the person he loved—

00:34:24.416 --> 00:34:27.293
but as the person who’s been
with him his whole life.

00:34:27.965 --> 00:34:29.383
That’s what matters.

00:34:35.537 --> 00:34:37.122
All right, I’ll go ahead, sweetheart.

00:34:58.197 --> 00:34:59.907
Is this really the right decision?

00:35:00.758 --> 00:35:01.926
Maybe I shouldn’t do this.

00:35:08.088 --> 00:35:10.149
Are you just going
to keep running away?

00:35:10.303 --> 00:35:13.056
You’re leaving already.
Just face him.

00:35:37.323 --> 00:35:39.366
Fine. Just one doorbell.

00:35:39.519 --> 00:35:42.485
If he doesn’t answer,
I’ll leave right away.

00:35:42.648 --> 00:35:44.567
That means we were never
meant to see each other.

00:36:03.388 --> 00:36:04.806
Maybe he didn’t hear it.

00:36:04.978 --> 00:36:06.032
Let’s try again.

00:36:26.762 --> 00:36:28.055
I guess he’s not here.

00:37:01.159 --> 00:37:02.160
Hi.

00:37:03.526 --> 00:37:04.587
Via?

00:37:06.873 --> 00:37:07.874
Come in.

00:37:08.594 --> 00:37:10.429
Sorry, I just got out of the shower.

00:37:51.402 --> 00:37:52.695
Are you sick?

00:37:57.293 --> 00:37:59.295
Get some rest. I’ll go home now.

00:38:00.469 --> 00:38:01.470
Rye.

00:38:04.556 --> 00:38:06.224
Don’t you have anything to say?

00:38:14.889 --> 00:38:16.557
Why did you come here?

00:38:21.105 --> 00:38:22.773
Can you not ask questions?

00:38:24.505 --> 00:38:27.925
Can you act like nothing painful
ever happened between us?

00:38:30.419 --> 00:38:34.215
Can you go back to the time
before you wrote that song?

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:40.996
Just for now?

00:38:44.304 --> 00:38:45.514
Just this once.

00:39:35.378 --> 00:39:36.379
Via—

00:39:39.985 --> 00:39:41.653
It’s okay, Arkin.

00:39:45.021 --> 00:39:46.022
It’s okay.

00:39:48.235 --> 00:39:50.988
I want all my firsts to be with you.

00:39:57.619 --> 00:40:01.623
Because after this, I have to leave.

00:42:42.036 --> 00:42:44.247
I’m sorry I doubted you.

00:42:48.091 --> 00:42:51.350
I’m sorry I wasn’t there
when you were hurting.

00:42:56.014 --> 00:42:58.308
I’m sorry I left you.

00:43:03.021 --> 00:43:04.731
I’m leaving you again.

00:43:16.984 --> 00:43:21.572
I’m sorry for the times
I wasn’t there when you needed me.

00:43:25.001 --> 00:43:27.587
I’m sorry I didn’t fight
hard enough for you.

00:43:36.513 --> 00:43:38.848
Thank you for everything.

00:43:42.776 --> 00:43:47.405
Thank you for being
with me my whole life.

00:43:52.028 --> 00:43:55.949
Thank you for all the
music you made for me.

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:00.578
Thank you for the happiness.

00:44:02.205 --> 00:44:05.083
Thank you for the love.

00:44:08.878 --> 00:44:11.047
Thank you for taking care of me.

00:44:14.584 --> 00:44:17.887
Thank you for taking
care of my family.

00:44:23.735 --> 00:44:25.570
You took care of me

00:44:25.595 --> 00:44:28.640
when I was too busy
taking care of everyone else.

00:44:37.588 --> 00:44:41.008
You’re the only one
I’ve ever loved like this, Kino.

00:45:09.152 --> 00:45:11.404
We just saw each other again.

00:45:19.617 --> 00:45:22.578
So, after this hug,

00:45:25.577 --> 00:45:28.538
you have to let me go again.

00:45:53.451 --> 00:45:56.036
Thank you for everything.

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:00.114
And I love you.

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.801
Always have, always will.

00:46:09.543 --> 00:46:11.628
My best friend.

00:46:13.463 --> 00:46:14.756
My love.

00:46:18.458 --> 00:46:20.210
My music.

00:47:36.878 --> 00:47:38.087
Via?

00:47:41.135 --> 00:47:42.177
Via!

00:48:00.197 --> 00:48:02.115
Did I do something again?

00:48:11.459 --> 00:48:12.460
Yeah?

00:48:12.843 --> 00:48:14.011
Where are you right now?

00:48:15.792 --> 00:48:17.549
At my condo. Why? What’s going on?

00:48:18.328 --> 00:48:19.787
Arkin, listen.

00:48:20.213 --> 00:48:22.090
I can’t help but tell you this.

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:25.213
Via told me to wait
until after she has left,

00:48:25.491 --> 00:48:26.893
but that just feels wrong.

00:48:27.053 --> 00:48:28.221
Via is leaving now.

00:48:28.221 --> 00:48:30.515
She’s going to Spain, and
she’s going to work there.

00:48:31.043 --> 00:48:32.205
What?

00:48:32.767 --> 00:48:33.976
She’s already on her
way to the airport.

00:48:33.976 --> 00:48:35.812
Terminal 3. Hurry!

00:49:15.518 --> 00:49:17.311
Your attention please.

00:49:17.311 --> 00:49:20.273
Please do not smoke
in the terminal area.

00:49:20.273 --> 00:49:24.110
Smoking is only permitted
in the specified smoking areas.

00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:25.362
Thank you.

00:49:49.218 --> 00:49:50.245
Via…

00:50:02.121 --> 00:50:03.284
Excuse me—

00:50:27.757 --> 00:50:29.675
- Please watch your luggages—
- Via.

00:50:31.546 --> 00:50:34.674
Here’s your passport and
your boarding pass, ma’am.

00:50:45.525 --> 00:50:47.401
- Your attention please.
- Ma’am?

00:50:47.401 --> 00:50:50.238
Please do not smoke
in the terminal area.

00:50:50.238 --> 00:50:53.366
Smoking is only permitted
in the specified smoking areas.

00:50:53.366 --> 00:50:55.868
- Have a safe flight.
- Thank you.

00:50:55.868 --> 00:50:57.870
Thank you. Next!

00:50:58.746 --> 00:50:59.705
Thanks.

00:51:23.563 --> 00:51:25.106
Your attention please.

00:51:25.439 --> 00:51:28.192
Please do not smoke
in the terminal area.

00:51:28.192 --> 00:51:32.029
Smoking is only permitted
in the specified smoking areas.

00:51:32.029 --> 00:51:32.947
Thank you.

00:51:32.947 --> 00:51:33.948
Via!

00:51:35.992 --> 00:51:36.993
Via!

00:51:44.166 --> 00:51:47.211
Hi, sir. Your passport
and boarding pass, please.

00:51:47.211 --> 00:51:49.088
Sir, I just need to find
someone. It won’t take long.

00:51:49.088 --> 00:51:51.549
I’m sorry, sir.
You’re not allowed to go in.

00:51:52.174 --> 00:51:54.135
Please, sir, just for a moment.

00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:57.029
Sorry, sir.

00:51:57.054 --> 00:51:58.055
Please.

00:51:58.055 --> 00:51:58.973
- Sir.
- Via!

00:51:58.973 --> 00:52:00.891
Sir, please just listen.
You’re really not allowed.

00:52:01.267 --> 00:52:02.602
- Sir.
- Via!

00:52:02.602 --> 00:52:03.603
You’re really not allowed, sir.

00:52:03.603 --> 00:52:04.645
I’m sorry.

00:52:04.937 --> 00:52:06.564
This is as far as you can go, sir.

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:09.233
Please stay there, sir.

00:52:09.233 --> 00:52:10.443
You really can’t go past this point.

00:52:10.443 --> 00:52:12.069
Sir, please don’t force it.

00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:13.029
Please don’t force it.

00:52:13.029 --> 00:52:14.572
I just need to stop
someone from leaving.

00:52:14.572 --> 00:52:16.157
I’m sorry, sir.
You’re really not allowed.

00:52:16.157 --> 00:52:17.366
You can only go this far.

00:52:17.366 --> 00:52:18.326
You’re not allowed to enter.

00:52:18.326 --> 00:52:19.839
This is really
as far as you can go.

00:52:35.639 --> 00:52:37.474
Please watch your luggages—

00:53:08.042 --> 00:53:09.251
You said…

00:53:10.869 --> 00:53:13.424
You said you wouldn’t leave me.

00:54:26.291 --> 00:54:28.752
Hello, Arkin. How are you?

00:54:31.562 --> 00:54:32.772
Bro.

00:54:37.509 --> 00:54:39.761
Am I a bad person?

00:54:39.884 --> 00:54:42.887
Huh? Why would you say that?

00:54:49.143 --> 00:54:51.687
Why is this happening?

00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:58.736
I don’t understand why
I’m being put through this.

00:55:00.088 --> 00:55:01.631
Hold on. Let’s meet up!

00:55:22.009 --> 00:55:24.512
I’m not used
to not having Via, bro.

00:55:24.983 --> 00:55:26.818
How could you
ever get used to it?

00:55:27.014 --> 00:55:29.350
You’ve been together
since you were kids,

00:55:29.767 --> 00:55:31.894
even before you were born.

00:55:35.523 --> 00:55:38.359
Shit, I gave my whole life to her.

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:43.536
All my plans had her in them.

00:55:47.099 --> 00:55:52.604
We promised each other we’d
stay together until we’re old.

00:55:54.625 --> 00:55:57.336
We promised a future together.

00:56:02.383 --> 00:56:04.385
How am I supposed
to get used to this?

00:56:15.813 --> 00:56:17.606
You won’t get used to it, bro.

00:56:19.315 --> 00:56:23.513
You’ll just learn how to live
with something missing.

00:56:27.142 --> 00:56:30.970
Just thinking about Via
crying every night

00:56:34.665 --> 00:56:37.877
when I wasn’t there
by her side…

00:56:38.836 --> 00:56:40.212
Damn it.

00:56:42.339 --> 00:56:48.888
I feel like such a useless friend.

00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:51.025
You know that feeling?

00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:53.427
Even just being her friend,

00:56:55.039 --> 00:56:57.333
I couldn’t even do that for her.

00:57:01.616 --> 00:57:06.078
Bro, you were struggling
back then, too, right?

00:57:08.449 --> 00:57:10.784
For sure, she understood that.

00:57:14.204 --> 00:57:17.124
I just don’t know
where to begin without Via.

00:57:37.519 --> 00:57:38.979
Via!

00:57:39.229 --> 00:57:40.439
Via!

00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.152
- Can I—
- Did you see it?

00:57:45.152 --> 00:57:46.111
You smell like Spain.

00:57:46.111 --> 00:57:47.988
Larkin Sanchez!

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.326
This song is about someone

00:57:53.202 --> 00:57:56.914
who wants to confess their
love to their closest friend.

00:58:14.405 --> 00:58:16.115
Have you been taught already?

00:58:16.304 --> 00:58:17.305
Taught?

00:58:17.935 --> 00:58:20.771
Taught how to play
the guitar before.

00:58:21.941 --> 00:58:24.194

00:58:24.926 --> 00:58:27.637
