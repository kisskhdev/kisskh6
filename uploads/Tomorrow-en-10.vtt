WEBVTT

00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:29.938
I am sure people
would love her even more

00:00:29.938 --> 00:00:33.024
if they saw how good
her heart is every day.

00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:34.859
But why are you jealous, huh?

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.736
Are you jealous of Clea?

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:37.696
No.

00:00:38.446 --> 00:00:39.531
No, not at all.

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:42.909
It doesn’t really matter to me
how you define our relationship.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.997
Ladies and gentlemen.
Let’s welcome!

00:00:46.997 --> 00:00:50.291
Larkin, are you already
courting Clea?

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:53.086
No, not yet. Nothing like that.

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:55.422
Kino’s management
even had him delete

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:58.174
the pictures of us together
from his social media.

00:00:58.174 --> 00:00:59.718
Really?

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.303
Oh, yeah.

00:01:02.554 --> 00:01:05.348
I think Arkin is just
looking out for you, too.

00:01:06.971 --> 00:01:09.182
About what happened
earlier with Clea,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.813
that was management’s order.

00:01:11.813 --> 00:01:15.191
I understand, and you’re right.

00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:17.027
You are single, right?

00:01:17.027 --> 00:01:18.486
Kino, you know what?

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:20.822
I want to keep you
all to myself,

00:01:20.822 --> 00:01:22.240
away from your fangirls.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.328
I’m sorry.

00:01:33.251 --> 00:01:34.252
- He doesn’t know how to kiss.
- What?

00:01:34.252 --> 00:01:35.211
- He doesn’t know how to kiss.
- Hey!

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.847
The fans are going to
get mad, you’re so loud.

00:01:44.012 --> 00:01:45.430
Surprise!

00:01:47.265 --> 00:01:48.725
Hi, what’s your name?

00:01:49.485 --> 00:01:50.486
Rye.

00:01:51.895 --> 00:01:52.918
Okay.

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:27.907
Okay.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.290
What?

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.084
This is cute. It suits you.

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:39.294
You look like a bear.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.588
Luna pushed me to wear it.

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:44.257
I just gave in.
What are you talking about?

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:47.010
It looks good on you, especially
with my face right there.

00:03:48.052 --> 00:03:49.971
Let’s just go. I’m hungry.

00:03:50.305 --> 00:03:52.223
What do you want
to eat? I’ll cook.

00:03:53.474 --> 00:03:54.475
Really?

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:04.194
Your phone’s ringing.
Answer it.

00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:05.486
Okay.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.531
Yo, Madam.

00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:10.325
Hey, where are you?

00:04:10.325 --> 00:04:12.952
I’m at the Italian restaurant
we went to last time.

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:15.830
I’m with Director Salvino.
Remember him?

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.374
The one whose film got
nominated at Cannes?

00:04:18.374 --> 00:04:21.419
You should stop by so I can
briefly introduce you to him.

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.422
And you can also get your
jacket from me while you’re at it.

00:04:26.504 --> 00:04:27.713
Sure, I’ll swing by.

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.553
I’m with someone, though,
so I can’t stay long.

00:04:31.262 --> 00:04:32.939
- See you!
- Okay. See you.

00:04:38.984 --> 00:04:40.299
I’ll just make a quick stop.

00:05:01.858 --> 00:05:02.899
Hi.

00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:04.796
Hey, someone might see us.

00:05:04.796 --> 00:05:05.797
Of course, I already checked.

00:05:05.797 --> 00:05:07.006
There’s no one around. Okay?

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:10.176
Sorry, it took a while.

00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:11.928
You probably got
bored waiting in the car.

00:05:12.136 --> 00:05:14.013
Director Salvino
was really chatty.

00:05:14.264 --> 00:05:15.974
It’s fine. I just went
to the restroom anyway.

00:05:17.141 --> 00:05:18.935
So, let’s go. Dinner?

00:05:22.744 --> 00:05:23.745
Hey!

00:05:24.095 --> 00:05:25.430
I forgot to give this back.

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:28.361
Thank you.

00:05:30.571 --> 00:05:32.532
Wow. She really gets you starstruck.

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.200
Clea—

00:05:34.492 --> 00:05:35.493
I’ll go ahead.

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:43.418
You'd better not get caught.

00:05:55.596 --> 00:05:57.265
So that was Clea.

00:05:58.891 --> 00:05:59.892
Wow.

00:06:00.852 --> 00:06:01.853
Come on.

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:03.855
Come on, let’s go.

00:06:08.484 --> 00:06:09.569
You know,

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:11.529
I got really nervous earlier
with Director Salvino.

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:13.281
I felt like he was examining
my whole existence

00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:14.449
just by the way he looked at me.

00:06:14.824 --> 00:06:18.202
Then he said he wants
to get Clea for a project.

00:06:18.453 --> 00:06:21.914
Clea told me they’re already
talking about including me, too.

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:23.291
I really hope it pushes through.

00:06:25.501 --> 00:06:26.502
Know what,

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:30.006
that was my first time
seeing Clea in person earlier.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.009
She really is beautiful.

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:34.969
I totally froze when I saw her.

00:06:36.054 --> 00:06:38.056
Are you sure you never
had a crush on her?

00:06:39.182 --> 00:06:40.183
Via, come on.

00:06:40.475 --> 00:06:42.560
My whole life, you’re the only
one I’ve ever had a crush on.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.519
Okay?

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:48.316
By the way, what got into
you and Luna

00:06:48.316 --> 00:06:50.026
joining my fan club, huh?

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:53.025
Huh?

00:06:56.157 --> 00:06:57.033
I was just forced.

00:06:57.033 --> 00:06:58.409
Luna really
pushed me into it.

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:00.912
I just got dragged
along, that’s all.

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:04.374
That girl can be
crazy sometimes.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.168
Sorry, Luna.

00:07:07.168 --> 00:07:09.629
I know I was the one
who got you involved.

00:07:10.838 --> 00:07:12.423
But you know
what’s even crazier?

00:07:12.423 --> 00:07:13.174
Huh?

00:07:13.174 --> 00:07:14.467
That larkinsings account.

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:18.179
It keeps uploading my
high school throwback pictures.

00:07:18.179 --> 00:07:20.598
And they post photos where
I look like an idiot.

00:07:21.557 --> 00:07:25.103
Oh yeah, I know that one.
Larkinsings.

00:07:29.023 --> 00:07:30.733
But I feel like that’s
one of our batchmates.

00:07:30.733 --> 00:07:31.776
Who do you think it is?

00:07:31.776 --> 00:07:34.112
I swear, I’m this close
to blocking that account.

00:07:38.032 --> 00:07:40.535
Let it go. They’re just a fan.

00:07:40.535 --> 00:07:43.162
Besides, you were cute
in high school anyway.

00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:44.778
I was cute in high school?

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:46.207
Then why did you reject me?

00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:52.205
Here he goes again, so dramatic.

00:07:52.296 --> 00:07:53.464
Look at us.

00:07:54.215 --> 00:07:56.801
We’re together now.
Aren’t we a couple?

00:07:57.885 --> 00:08:00.972
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:08:04.475 --> 00:08:05.520
By the way.

00:08:05.977 --> 00:08:08.788
By the way, how do you think
we should tell Papa

00:08:08.813 --> 00:08:10.231
that we’re together?

00:08:10.898 --> 00:08:13.693
I’m kind of nervous
about how he’ll react.

00:08:14.402 --> 00:08:15.570
Do you want me to tell him?

00:08:16.028 --> 00:08:17.088
No.

00:08:17.113 --> 00:08:19.157
I want us to tell him together.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.950
What about Luna
and the others?

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.493
How do we tell them?

00:08:23.112 --> 00:08:24.322
Don’t they know already?

00:08:25.746 --> 00:08:28.666
We haven’t officially
told them yet.

00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.170
With all our flirting,
they still haven’t noticed?

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:33.129
Jeez.

00:08:37.592 --> 00:08:38.593
Wait a minute.

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:42.555
I’ll just answer it.

00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:49.270
Yes, Sir Matt?

00:08:50.188 --> 00:08:51.189
Yes.

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:53.649
Tomorrow. I’ll pick Clea up.

00:08:54.442 --> 00:08:55.443
Lunch time?

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.197
Okay, got it. All right.

00:08:59.197 --> 00:09:00.364
Yes. Thank you.

00:09:08.706 --> 00:09:10.124
Via, so tomorrow—

00:09:10.791 --> 00:09:13.961
I need to have lunch
with Clea for publicity.

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:20.176
And I might also
be busy this week

00:09:20.176 --> 00:09:23.930
because of tapings and
promoting my single.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.796
Sorry, Via.

00:09:25.821 --> 00:09:27.573
We might not be
able to see each other.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:33.856
It’s okay.

00:09:33.856 --> 00:09:36.651
I also have a lot to take care
of at school anyway.

00:09:38.194 --> 00:09:40.321
But when our
schedules line up,

00:09:40.802 --> 00:09:41.906
we’ll see each other, okay?

00:09:43.324 --> 00:09:44.333
Okay.

00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:45.974
Alright.

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:54.230
Rising actor Larkin
Sanchez’s debut single snags

00:09:54.254 --> 00:09:57.296
the No. 1 spot on the
Philippine music chart.

00:09:59.674 --> 00:10:02.593
This is your fault, Larkin Sanchez.
I’m gonna cry.

00:10:02.593 --> 00:10:04.470
Your song is making me relapse.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.294
The song, written by
half of the

00:10:07.318 --> 00:10:10.142
ArClea love team, first gained
traction on social media.

00:10:10.142 --> 00:10:14.522
To date, the song “Golden Scenery”
has reached 5.9 million streams.

00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:17.441
This song speaks of a love confession
to one’s best friend.

00:10:17.441 --> 00:10:20.236
And the whole country can relate.

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:27.493
Via, do you have any
funny photos of Arkin?

00:10:27.698 --> 00:10:31.076
I want to post one on my
stan account, for clout.

00:10:31.101 --> 00:10:32.811
Or I could sell it too.

00:10:33.457 --> 00:10:34.911
Hey, Luna, did you know—

00:10:35.751 --> 00:10:39.922
Kino got really irritated by
that larkinsings account.

00:10:39.922 --> 00:10:41.757
He says he’s this
close to blocking it.

00:10:41.757 --> 00:10:46.220
You might end up getting
reported to his manager.

00:10:46.512 --> 00:10:48.097
I don’t really care.

00:10:50.766 --> 00:10:52.368
I’m going to buy some fishballs.
Want some?

00:10:52.393 --> 00:10:53.811
- I’m good.
- All right.

00:10:53.811 --> 00:10:54.312
I’ll follow.

00:10:54.312 --> 00:10:55.380
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:11:03.988 --> 00:11:05.740
Hey, Via!

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.285
We’re partners
for the project, right?

00:11:09.285 --> 00:11:10.620
Want to talk about it?

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:12.297
Sure.

00:11:16.792 --> 00:11:19.503
You’re looking at pictures
of Larkin and Clea.

00:11:20.129 --> 00:11:21.505
Are you a fan too?

00:11:25.635 --> 00:11:27.553
Kind of. Just a bit.

00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:29.764
You know,

00:11:30.139 --> 00:11:32.933
I’m not really
into Larkin for Clea.

00:11:33.434 --> 00:11:35.603
She’s too good for him.

00:11:36.527 --> 00:11:37.945
What did you say?

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:41.776
I mean,

00:11:42.985 --> 00:11:44.445
why not?

00:11:45.488 --> 00:11:48.074
Larkin seems okay,
don’t you think?

00:11:48.783 --> 00:11:52.286
I feel like that Larkin guy
isn’t serious about Clea.

00:11:54.789 --> 00:11:56.499
How can you say that?

00:11:56.582 --> 00:11:58.388
What, does he look
like a cheater to you?

00:11:58.918 --> 00:11:59.794
You should look in the mirror,

00:11:59.794 --> 00:12:01.671
you look more like
a cheater than he does.

00:12:01.671 --> 00:12:04.590
Wow, this Larkin stan
is intense.

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:06.050
I’ve been a Clea fan
for a long time.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:10.096
I know they wouldn’t do that
unless they needed publicity.

00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:12.223
They need publicity,
that’s all it is.

00:12:12.223 --> 00:12:13.891
that’s why
they’re doing it.

00:12:15.142 --> 00:12:18.479
I even feel like Larkin
has another girlfriend.

00:12:19.063 --> 00:12:20.940
Probably non-showbiz.

00:12:29.407 --> 00:12:30.700
Non-showbiz?

00:12:32.326 --> 00:12:36.122
No way Larkin has
a non-showbiz girlfriend.

00:12:36.372 --> 00:12:39.417
It’s Clea. Clea is
his girlfriend, okay?

00:12:40.418 --> 00:12:41.669
Non-showbiz? Nonsense!

00:12:41.669 --> 00:12:44.296
With his looks,
it’s impossible he’s single.

00:12:44.505 --> 00:12:49.051
Or maybe he left
his old girlfriend for Clea.

00:12:52.096 --> 00:12:54.265
I’ve been a Larkin fan
for a long time, okay?

00:12:54.265 --> 00:12:55.224
Of Larkin.

00:12:55.224 --> 00:12:57.101
A very long time. Look, look.

00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:58.894
There. See?

00:12:59.228 --> 00:13:01.188
I know his face really well.

00:13:01.188 --> 00:13:02.189
That smile right there?

00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:04.150
That’s his smile
when he’s in love.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.944
The smile of a guy without
a non-showbiz girlfriend, okay?

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.029
All right,

00:13:10.322 --> 00:13:11.240
whatever you say.

00:13:13.075 --> 00:13:14.535
The project, let’s get
back to the project.

00:13:14.535 --> 00:13:15.870
- Oh right. Okay.
- Seriously…

00:13:18.289 --> 00:13:19.290
It’s so hot.

00:13:20.708 --> 00:13:22.168
What are we going to do?

00:13:25.588 --> 00:13:29.091
Just five more scenes
and I can finally sleep.

00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:32.470
He looks so exhausted.

00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:35.556
I should post a sweet message
using my stan account.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.892
He won’t even know.

00:13:41.353 --> 00:13:47.193
Good luck at the shoot,
baby @larkinsanchez.

00:13:47.777 --> 00:13:52.198
Don’t forget to drink water!

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.164
Wow, being sweet
is actually awkward.

00:14:00.164 --> 00:14:02.541
Even if I know Arkin
won’t know it’s me

00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:06.587
and probably won’t notice,
it’s still embarrassing.

00:14:14.762 --> 00:14:15.846
I think you
were hacked, Via.

00:14:15.846 --> 00:14:16.514
WTF HAHAHA
I WANNA HAVE MY OWN BABY TOO.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.690
Arkin, just admit it.
You posted it, right?

00:14:18.724 --> 00:14:19.879
Wow, Via, you revived

00:14:19.904 --> 00:14:20.993
- How to unsee?
- your account just for this?

00:14:21.018 --> 00:14:23.020
- Jerks, I didn’t post that.
- So sweet.

00:14:23.486 --> 00:14:24.550
Shit!

00:14:25.022 --> 00:14:26.190
Shit, shit!

00:14:29.652 --> 00:14:30.736
Delete, delete—

00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:31.872
Delete!

00:14:35.574 --> 00:14:36.575
Okay.

00:14:47.211 --> 00:14:50.673
Hydrating myself because
my girlfriend told me to.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.427
This is so embarrassing!

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.519
So embarrassing!

00:15:05.646 --> 00:15:08.649
Baby, be careful
at the shoot today!

00:15:08.649 --> 00:15:10.734
Don’t forget
to drink water!

00:15:12.444 --> 00:15:14.446
Can you all
stop already!

00:15:16.031 --> 00:15:18.576
This baby can’t take a joke.

00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:24.999
Don’t worry. We’ve known
you two were together for a long time.

00:15:26.166 --> 00:15:29.086
Only you guys didn’t know.

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:42.099
Must be nice.
Because of that,

00:15:42.099 --> 00:15:44.685
I’m gonna drink a lot
at Sam’s party this weekend.

00:15:44.685 --> 00:15:46.520
Hey, make sure
you guys come.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.732
Yeah, we’ll go
with you. Don’t worry.

00:15:58.866 --> 00:16:01.952
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:16:02.828 --> 00:16:04.830
Hi, guys! What’s up?

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.040
Hey, thanks for the invite!

00:16:06.206 --> 00:16:08.626
Sam, you said it
was just a small party,

00:16:08.626 --> 00:16:10.961
but it looks like
you invited everyone.

00:16:10.961 --> 00:16:12.963
Luna, it’s a fundraising party,

00:16:12.963 --> 00:16:15.424
so I gotta invite
as many as I can.

00:16:15.674 --> 00:16:17.593
By the way, where’s Ke?

00:16:17.843 --> 00:16:19.762
Oh, I already messaged her.
She said she’s on her way.

00:16:20.095 --> 00:16:22.473
Hey, I also invited Theo, okay.

00:16:22.932 --> 00:16:24.350
Careful, he might cry.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.351
Hold on, guys.

00:16:30.981 --> 00:16:34.068
He’s not here, Luna.
Stop looking around.

00:16:35.152 --> 00:16:35.986
Huh?

00:16:35.986 --> 00:16:37.821
I’m not looking around.

00:16:38.614 --> 00:16:40.741
And where’s your baby anyway?

00:16:41.116 --> 00:16:42.326
She doesn’t drink.

00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:47.164
Via, where’s Arkin?

00:16:47.456 --> 00:16:48.958
Is he allowed here?

00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.793
This place might be
too crowded for him.

00:16:50.793 --> 00:16:55.005
Huh? He said it’s okay,
so he said he’ll come later.

00:16:55.005 --> 00:16:56.423
- What about Yanna?
- Okay.

00:16:58.092 --> 00:16:59.343
She’s with Avi right now,

00:16:59.343 --> 00:17:00.678
so she can’t come.

00:17:03.806 --> 00:17:04.890
Drink some more!

00:17:05.474 --> 00:17:06.850
Wait, I’ll just get a drink.

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.310
What? We already
have bottles here,

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:09.645
and you’re still
getting another drink?

00:17:09.645 --> 00:17:10.813
This one’s too strong.

00:17:11.188 --> 00:17:13.357
It’s okay.
Just order over there.

00:17:13.357 --> 00:17:14.733
- It’s on me, okay?
- I’ll be back.

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:17.736
Cheers.

00:17:17.736 --> 00:17:19.405
You guys are trying
to get me drunk.

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:20.864
It’s not funny anymore.

00:17:26.192 --> 00:17:26.801
- I heard
- Excuse me,

00:17:26.826 --> 00:17:28.966
- he’s coming, Clea.
- one strawberry margarita, please.

00:17:28.998 --> 00:17:29.999
Thank you.

00:17:33.794 --> 00:17:35.045
Do I look okay?

00:17:36.505 --> 00:17:39.049
Girl, you look stunning.

00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:42.594
But still, I feel like
I’m running out of charm.

00:17:43.262 --> 00:17:44.972
Why can’t he just like me back?

00:17:46.181 --> 00:17:48.642
Is she talking about Arkin?

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:51.437
Thanks.

00:18:04.408 --> 00:18:06.869
Just stop looking for him.

00:18:06.869 --> 00:18:09.204
He’s not here.
He’s busy.

00:18:09.204 --> 00:18:11.165
Why do you keep saying
I’m looking for him?

00:18:11.165 --> 00:18:12.916
I’m not even looking for him.

00:18:13.167 --> 00:18:15.753
Please, you’re going to get
a stiff neck at this rate.

00:18:16.336 --> 00:18:18.797
What is wrong with you guys?

00:18:18.797 --> 00:18:22.593
How am I supposed to move on
if you keep teasing me like this?

00:18:22.593 --> 00:18:24.136
You’re all so annoying.

00:18:27.056 --> 00:18:28.348
Anyway, wait a minute, guys.

00:18:28.348 --> 00:18:30.434
Excuse me,
I’ll step outside first.

00:18:30.434 --> 00:18:31.393
Okay.

00:18:33.103 --> 00:18:36.315
They’re teasing you
again. It’s okay.

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:39.443
Sam, how am I
supposed to move on?

00:18:39.443 --> 00:18:40.402
No.

00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:42.237
Oh, there’s Kino.

00:18:43.363 --> 00:18:44.656
Oh, it’s you guys.

00:18:44.948 --> 00:18:46.784
Wow, superstar.

00:18:47.409 --> 00:18:48.535
I missed you.

00:18:48.535 --> 00:18:49.411
Bro.

00:18:49.703 --> 00:18:50.913
Are you an idiot, bro?

00:18:50.913 --> 00:18:52.498
There are so
many people around.

00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:54.500
Am I not allowed to sit
next to my girlfriend now?

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.834
Use your brain, man.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.670
So, even holding hands
is not allowed?

00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:01.757
Fine, let’s just hold hands
with each other then.

00:19:01.757 --> 00:19:04.593
Hey…

00:19:09.056 --> 00:19:10.432
Kino, earlier I—

00:19:14.478 --> 00:19:16.230
I still have somewhere
else to go,

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:18.023
so I might head home already.

00:19:18.482 --> 00:19:19.775
Let’s go together.
I’ll take you home.

00:19:20.818 --> 00:19:22.778
No, someone might see us.

00:19:22.778 --> 00:19:24.363
It’s fine. We’ll just pass
through the back.

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:26.406
Wait, I’ll just text my driver.

00:19:27.282 --> 00:19:28.617
- Hey, cheers, cheers!
- Let me finish this first.

00:19:28.617 --> 00:19:30.452
Cheers before
you leave. Cheers!

00:19:30.452 --> 00:19:32.204
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:33.288
Arkin!

00:19:33.288 --> 00:19:34.248
Is this mine?

00:19:34.248 --> 00:19:36.208
Yeah. Cheers!

00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:39.670
Refreshing.

00:19:44.508 --> 00:19:45.509
Clea?

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.297
Hey.

00:19:48.137 --> 00:19:49.429
Dating a fan?

00:19:50.097 --> 00:19:51.098
Weird.

00:19:51.265 --> 00:19:52.474
No—

00:19:52.474 --> 00:19:53.475
Wait a minute.

00:19:54.226 --> 00:19:55.477
I’ll just meet my driver.

00:19:56.562 --> 00:19:57.563
Okay.

00:20:02.359 --> 00:20:03.360
I’ll go ahead.

00:20:04.153 --> 00:20:05.154
Wait.

00:20:06.655 --> 00:20:07.656
Wear this.

00:20:09.735 --> 00:20:10.742
Trust me.

00:20:10.993 --> 00:20:13.203
I’m doing this to protect
everyone involved.

00:20:22.838 --> 00:20:23.839
Hold on.

00:20:27.573 --> 00:20:28.574
Here.

00:20:34.141 --> 00:20:35.142
Thanks.

00:20:36.476 --> 00:20:37.477
I’ll go ahead.

00:21:00.667 --> 00:21:04.046
Shit. Good thing she
lent me her jacket.

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:07.466
Hi, Via.

00:21:08.421 --> 00:21:09.422
Come on.

00:21:09.843 --> 00:21:11.845
Let’s talk about the project.

00:21:13.847 --> 00:21:17.226
Hey, I saw that too.
It really hurt.

00:21:17.684 --> 00:21:18.977
My Clea.

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:21.063
But do you think
they’re really dating?

00:21:21.688 --> 00:21:23.690
I’m still not convinced.

00:21:24.691 --> 00:21:27.236
Well, they don’t really need
to convince you anyway.

00:21:27.945 --> 00:21:29.821
Aren’t you also a Larkin fan?

00:21:30.155 --> 00:21:32.783
Are you really okay
with him having a girlfriend?

00:21:35.535 --> 00:21:36.730
Of course.

00:21:36.828 --> 00:21:39.998
Of course.
As long as he’s happy.

00:21:40.624 --> 00:21:42.793
I’m okay as long as he’s happy.

00:21:42.793 --> 00:21:44.044
I’m not like you, okay?

00:21:44.586 --> 00:21:45.837
Hey, that’s harsh.

00:21:45.837 --> 00:21:48.715
I just don’t really like
Larkin because I feel like

00:21:49.383 --> 00:21:52.177
he’s only sticking
close to Clea to get famous.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:57.224
All of Clea’s on-screen partners
end up getting popular anyway.

00:21:58.867 --> 00:22:01.536
Larkin can become
famous on his own,

00:22:01.561 --> 00:22:04.273
even without Clea.
He can do it on his own.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.526
All right, I won’t argue with
a Larkin stan anymore.

00:22:07.526 --> 00:22:09.444
You might punch me next.

00:22:10.279 --> 00:22:13.740
About our project, we still need
to talk about the details.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.452
I’ll just buy the materials,
so it’ll be faster.

00:22:17.786 --> 00:22:18.829
So what is it again?

00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:20.914
Do you like strong perfumes?

00:22:28.463 --> 00:22:29.673
You smell like a guy.

00:22:29.673 --> 00:22:31.300
So you have a boyfriend, huh?

00:22:33.427 --> 00:22:35.137
No, I don’t have a boyfriend.

00:22:35.595 --> 00:22:36.638
I don’t have a boyfriend.

00:22:36.638 --> 00:22:37.889
Via, are you done?

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:39.891
Yes—

00:22:41.073 --> 00:22:42.311
Yeah, I’m done.

00:22:44.079 --> 00:22:47.833
About the project, just message
me the other details, okay?

00:22:47.858 --> 00:22:49.067
My friend’s already here.

00:22:49.234 --> 00:22:51.987
Wait, Via. What about my hug?

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:54.865
- Via, come on.
- Just message me.

00:22:54.865 --> 00:22:55.824
Okay, I’m heading out.

00:22:56.283 --> 00:22:57.269
Be careful.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.081
Kino, someone might see us.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.714
Kino, Dan was just joking, okay?

00:23:11.882 --> 00:23:12.883
Friend?

00:23:13.759 --> 00:23:15.218
I’m just a friend.

00:23:15.218 --> 00:23:18.972
I’m sorry. I just haven’t
told him yet

00:23:18.972 --> 00:23:22.434
that I have a boyfriend,
and he’s really nosy.

00:23:22.434 --> 00:23:25.395
It’s better to be careful.
He’s also a Clea fan.

00:23:26.772 --> 00:23:29.524
I’m just a friend,
not even a best friend?

00:23:32.194 --> 00:23:34.613
Wow, you’re so petty.

00:23:34.706 --> 00:23:35.915
I’m sorry.

00:23:36.755 --> 00:23:38.465
Don’t be mad, okay?

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:41.536
Are we good now?

00:23:42.162 --> 00:23:44.915
Let’s go. Where should we eat?
Your condo?

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:48.585
I was thinking, your place.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.548
Via, should we tell
Papa already?

00:24:03.642 --> 00:24:05.394
Arkin, good thing
you dropped by.

00:24:05.394 --> 00:24:06.978
We’ve missed eating with you.

00:24:08.063 --> 00:24:09.481
Pa, I missed
your cooking more.

00:24:09.481 --> 00:24:10.440
Seriously.

00:24:11.858 --> 00:24:14.653
Just come by whenever
you have time, okay?

00:24:15.445 --> 00:24:16.738
So how’s taping?

00:24:17.531 --> 00:24:19.282
Are you busy?
Got a lot of projects?

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.077
A lot, Pa. I’m pretty busy.

00:24:22.577 --> 00:24:23.370
That’s good.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.080
Take advantage of it
while there’s plenty.

00:24:26.081 --> 00:24:27.666
By the way, I saw on the news…

00:24:27.666 --> 00:24:30.085
Looks like you’re being linked
to your love team partner.

00:24:30.162 --> 00:24:31.233
Are you two a couple?

00:24:38.135 --> 00:24:41.805
Pa, we have
something to tell you.

00:24:42.556 --> 00:24:43.557
Well—

00:24:44.015 --> 00:24:45.267
Pa, Via and I are together.

00:24:49.229 --> 00:24:51.148
She’s my girlfriend. Not Clea.

00:25:08.123 --> 00:25:11.168
Wow. Congratulations.

00:25:11.168 --> 00:25:12.544
I knew it.

00:25:13.086 --> 00:25:15.172
So are we allowing this, Pa?

00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:22.345
Pa, sorry, sorry.
Please don’t get mad.

00:25:22.779 --> 00:25:24.948
We didn’t mean for it to happen.
It just kind of did.

00:25:24.973 --> 00:25:27.142
Please don’t be mad.
Forgive me, Pa.

00:25:27.934 --> 00:25:30.854
Wow, Via, you’re acting
like you lost out here.

00:25:32.022 --> 00:25:34.107
Pa, I’m sorry I didn’t
tell you right away.

00:25:35.275 --> 00:25:37.444
Pa, do you approve
of me and Via?

00:25:38.528 --> 00:25:41.281
Looks like you still haven’t
moved on from your crush on Via, huh?

00:25:42.949 --> 00:25:45.785
Pa, how could I move on
when we’re married?

00:25:45.785 --> 00:25:47.037
We’re married!

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:48.788
We’re married!

00:25:49.206 --> 00:25:51.082
Via and I got married.
Too bad you weren’t there.

00:25:51.082 --> 00:25:51.708
Look, here it is.

00:25:51.708 --> 00:25:53.168
Arkin and Via.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.544
Marriage certificate.

00:25:54.544 --> 00:25:57.753
And Pa, I did try to move on.

00:25:57.778 --> 00:25:59.446
Via was the one
who seduced me.

00:25:59.674 --> 00:26:00.967
- Kino, what are you saying?
- Ow!

00:26:00.967 --> 00:26:01.801
That was back in high school.

00:26:01.801 --> 00:26:03.178
And it was just a
marriage booth, remember?

00:26:03.178 --> 00:26:04.638
Just a marriage booth.

00:26:04.638 --> 00:26:06.181
- Via.
- Pa.

00:26:07.933 --> 00:26:10.852
You know what’s right
and what’s not, don’t you?

00:26:11.732 --> 00:26:13.275
That’s fine with me.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.811
And you, Arkin,
don’t you dare hurt Via.

00:26:16.983 --> 00:26:17.859
I dare you.

00:26:17.859 --> 00:26:19.361
Pa, why me?

00:26:19.653 --> 00:26:22.030
She’s the one who hurt my
feelings back in high school.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.280
Ouch!

00:26:23.672 --> 00:26:25.340
See, Pa, she’s hurting me again.

00:26:25.928 --> 00:26:26.929
Kino!

00:26:28.495 --> 00:26:30.288
But Pa, I promise

00:26:31.581 --> 00:26:33.291
I could never do that to Via.

00:26:35.168 --> 00:26:39.172
And Pa, since you’ve accepted
me as your son-in-law,

00:26:39.172 --> 00:26:40.507
I have something for you.

00:26:42.342 --> 00:26:43.510
Son-in-law?

00:26:46.638 --> 00:26:48.890
Dad, alcoholic drink.
This is for you.

00:26:50.392 --> 00:26:53.395
So you only brought this
because I gave my blessing?

00:26:53.395 --> 00:26:54.271
If I didn’t give my blessing,

00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:55.914
you wouldn’t give this to me?

00:26:55.939 --> 00:26:56.940
Come on, Pa.

00:26:57.524 --> 00:26:59.818
I know you wouldn’t
object anyway because

00:27:00.569 --> 00:27:02.445
I know you love me too.

00:27:04.573 --> 00:27:06.825
All right then,
let’s drink this now.

00:27:06.825 --> 00:27:07.894
Okay.

00:27:08.285 --> 00:27:10.704
Pa, wait, Kino might have
something to do later

00:27:10.704 --> 00:27:11.663
and need to go home.

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:13.540
And I also need to study.

00:27:13.748 --> 00:27:14.833
I don’t have
anything planned later.

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:16.710
Oh, so you’re available.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:18.295
Go study, sweetheart,

00:27:18.545 --> 00:27:20.547
and I’ll drink with
your boyfriend.

00:27:23.008 --> 00:27:24.009
Boyfriend.

00:27:28.388 --> 00:27:29.389
Boyfriend.

00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:33.768
Ouch! Pa!

00:27:35.645 --> 00:27:37.897
This is what you call,
tough love.

00:27:53.288 --> 00:27:54.247
Hi, Rhythmics!

00:27:54.247 --> 00:27:55.749
We have a set visit
this weekend

00:27:55.749 --> 00:27:58.043
at the shoot of
Arkin’s upcoming series.

00:27:58.043 --> 00:28:00.670
Only five slots are left,
so sign up now

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:03.089
if you want to come.
Let’s go!

00:28:07.177 --> 00:28:10.263
A set visit? Should I go?

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.642
Via, are you
free this weekend?

00:28:13.642 --> 00:28:16.061
There’s a set visit at
Larkin’s shoot. Let’s go!

00:28:16.061 --> 00:28:18.146
Sure, let's go.

00:28:30.825 --> 00:28:32.160
See you!
I’m so excited!

00:28:43.213 --> 00:28:44.756
It’s my first time
going on a set visit.

00:28:44.756 --> 00:28:48.134
I’m excited to see how
good Larkin is at acting.

00:28:48.134 --> 00:28:49.552
How about you, Via?
Are you excited?

00:28:49.552 --> 00:28:50.345
Honestly, I’m excited too.

00:28:50.345 --> 00:28:51.763
And I’m excited to
give him his gift.

00:28:51.763 --> 00:28:54.265
Guys, the staff will let us
inside so we can watch, okay?

00:28:54.891 --> 00:28:57.936
Please behave, especially
when we see Larkin.

00:28:57.936 --> 00:29:00.397
No shouting, no noise,

00:29:00.397 --> 00:29:02.357
especially once
they’re already on set.

00:29:03.274 --> 00:29:04.734
Please remain respectful
and make sure

00:29:04.734 --> 00:29:06.611
we don’t cause
any delay for them.

00:29:07.237 --> 00:29:09.489
We don’t want to
embarrass Larkin, right?

00:29:09.864 --> 00:29:11.116
You may go on set now.

00:29:14.411 --> 00:29:15.412
Thank you.

00:29:17.414 --> 00:29:18.748
Let’s go, let’s go.

00:29:26.798 --> 00:29:30.427
Out and three, two, one,
boom mic up.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.221
Action!

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.061
Wait.

00:29:42.147 --> 00:29:43.148
What?

00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:46.568
After all these years, looking
stupid waiting for you…

00:29:46.568 --> 00:29:47.902
And now

00:29:48.611 --> 00:29:51.114
you come back like you
didn’t completely ruin me?

00:29:51.364 --> 00:29:52.907
That’s not how it is, Philip!

00:29:53.867 --> 00:29:56.327
You don’t understand
what I’ve been through!

00:29:56.619 --> 00:29:58.455
You don’t understand me.

00:29:58.455 --> 00:30:00.206
Then make me understand!

00:30:01.082 --> 00:30:03.209
He’s such an
amazing actor now.

00:30:03.334 --> 00:30:05.253
You ruined me, too, Philip!

00:30:05.795 --> 00:30:07.046
I tried so hard to forget you,

00:30:07.046 --> 00:30:08.631
but I couldn’t!

00:30:13.261 --> 00:30:16.639
Wow, Clea’s on another level.

00:30:16.639 --> 00:30:19.934
How does she
even control her tears?

00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:26.858
They’re just
so perfect together.

00:30:44.751 --> 00:30:46.419
Cut! Very good actors!

00:30:48.254 --> 00:30:49.380
Beautiful, beautiful work.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.758
Wow! Clea Aguilar
is really amazing.

00:30:51.758 --> 00:30:53.593
Are you okay? Huh?

00:30:54.594 --> 00:30:55.970
You, are you okay?

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:17.283
Rhythmics, you may come in.

00:31:18.203 --> 00:31:19.289
Thank you.

00:31:19.661 --> 00:31:22.205
- Arkin, they have something for you.
- Guys—

00:31:22.205 --> 00:31:23.581
Hi, hello, hi!

00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:24.749
- Hi, Larkin! Hello.
- Hello.

00:31:24.749 --> 00:31:26.016
Hello.

00:31:26.292 --> 00:31:27.919
Via, give him our gifts.

00:31:28.044 --> 00:31:29.062
Okay.

00:31:29.087 --> 00:31:30.213
Do you remember her?

00:31:30.213 --> 00:31:31.923
She was at the Meet and Greet.

00:31:31.923 --> 00:31:34.759
Yes, Rye! R-Y-E, right?

00:31:35.301 --> 00:31:36.135
He remembers you.

00:31:36.135 --> 00:31:37.136
Hi, Rye.

00:31:38.263 --> 00:31:40.265
The fandom wanted
to give this to you.

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:43.142
- Wow.
- She picked out the chocolates herself.

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:44.811
Here’s more.

00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:47.121
These are my favorites!

00:31:47.287 --> 00:31:48.998
- He said those are his favorites.
- You really know me a lot, Rye.

00:31:49.023 --> 00:31:50.692
- In fairness.
- Here.

00:31:50.942 --> 00:31:52.569
Can we take a picture?

00:31:52.569 --> 00:31:53.444
Sure.

00:31:53.444 --> 00:31:54.946
- Let’s go.
- Hurry, there are more people waiting.

00:31:54.946 --> 00:31:58.992
One, two, three.

00:32:00.034 --> 00:32:02.245
- Thank you! Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:32:03.413 --> 00:32:04.414
- What about you, Rye?
- Thanks.

00:32:04.414 --> 00:32:05.665
Want to take a picture?

00:32:05.915 --> 00:32:07.083
Take a picture with me, come on.

00:32:07.083 --> 00:32:08.351
- Me?
- Don’t be shy.

00:32:08.376 --> 00:32:09.377
No need to be shy.

00:32:09.919 --> 00:32:11.754
- Let’s take a picture.
- Please take a picture with me.

00:32:13.548 --> 00:32:14.549
Come closer.

00:32:24.642 --> 00:32:25.602
Bye.

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:29.814
- Oh my gosh!
- I’m sorry!

00:32:29.814 --> 00:32:31.733
What the heck!

00:32:31.733 --> 00:32:33.943
Seriously, we need this
for the next scene.

00:32:33.943 --> 00:32:35.069
I’m so sorry.

00:32:35.069 --> 00:32:36.988
I’m sorry, I didn’t
mean to, I’m sorry.

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.908
Who are you and
what are you doing here?

00:32:39.908 --> 00:32:43.286
Don’t you know how much
you’re disturbing us?

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:45.246
I’m sorry.

00:32:45.246 --> 00:32:46.789
You guys shouldn’t even
come here on set.

00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:48.458
You’re driving me crazy!

00:32:48.892 --> 00:32:50.101
I’m going nuts.

00:32:50.126 --> 00:32:51.502
It’s okay, it’s okay.

00:32:51.502 --> 00:32:52.795
There’s no need to shout.

00:32:52.795 --> 00:32:55.214
I don’t want disrespectful
people in our set.

00:32:55.214 --> 00:32:56.841
Sorry. I’ll just ask
the director

00:32:56.841 --> 00:32:58.718
if we can do a different
sequence next.

00:32:58.718 --> 00:32:59.552
Yes, please, thank you.

00:32:59.577 --> 00:33:01.412
Gine, you guys
go out for now.

00:33:02.555 --> 00:33:04.349
I just want to check on Rye.

00:33:04.616 --> 00:33:05.617
Clea, let’s go!

00:33:05.642 --> 00:33:07.405
- I’ll go with you.
- Go change first.

00:33:07.769 --> 00:33:09.020
So annoying!

00:33:28.122 --> 00:33:29.791
So this is how it is here, huh?

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.584
There are so many lights.

00:33:33.169 --> 00:33:34.295
Have some chocolate.

00:33:35.129 --> 00:33:36.381
You might’ve gotten stressed.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.341
But that’s yours.

00:33:38.341 --> 00:33:39.133
Huh?

00:33:39.133 --> 00:33:39.801
That’s yours.

00:33:39.801 --> 00:33:40.802
I know.

00:33:40.802 --> 00:33:42.261
- More.
- Hold it.

00:33:42.804 --> 00:33:43.680
Have more.

00:33:49.394 --> 00:33:50.228
So many makeup brushes.

00:33:50.228 --> 00:33:51.479
Do you use all of
them on yourself?

00:33:51.479 --> 00:33:52.821
Yeah, different ones.

00:33:52.846 --> 00:33:55.019
One for the eyes,
one for the nose.

00:33:55.274 --> 00:33:56.651
For contouring, stuff like this.

00:33:56.651 --> 00:33:57.752
Contour?

00:33:57.777 --> 00:33:59.112
Do you still need that?

00:33:59.487 --> 00:34:01.614
Yeah, for the camera.

00:34:01.614 --> 00:34:04.033
It’ll show. It’s very visible.

00:34:08.198 --> 00:34:09.824
- Do you know how to use that?
- Let me just—

00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:11.778
Kino, Kino!

00:34:12.166 --> 00:34:13.167
What the—!

00:34:13.543 --> 00:34:14.544
I missed you.

00:34:15.628 --> 00:34:18.715
What the heck!
Someone might see us.

00:34:18.965 --> 00:34:20.508
And you even made them leave.

00:34:20.508 --> 00:34:21.718
They might be looking for me.

00:34:21.718 --> 00:34:23.052
They might start noticing.

00:34:23.752 --> 00:34:26.922
I already told them
I’d check on you.

00:34:28.141 --> 00:34:31.185
So, are you okay?
Sorry about earlier.

00:34:33.846 --> 00:34:37.725
You don’t need to
apologize. It’s my fault.

00:34:38.744 --> 00:34:42.387
But still, you shouldn’t have
been shouted at like that.

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:44.490
I’m annoyed.

00:34:45.033 --> 00:34:46.801
You know, I’ll talk to
the staff about that.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.161
Like—

00:34:48.911 --> 00:34:50.038
- It’s just that—
- No!

00:34:50.038 --> 00:34:52.040
You’re so hot-headed. Don’t—

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:53.541
Just kiss me then.

00:34:56.169 --> 00:34:57.353
There are people outside.

00:34:57.378 --> 00:34:58.046
Kiss.

00:34:58.087 --> 00:34:59.012
Kiss?

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:07.597
Good thing I said I’d call you.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:10.668
The director’s looking for you.

00:35:12.384 --> 00:35:13.385
Thanks, Clea.

00:35:14.103 --> 00:35:15.271
I’ll step out for now.

00:35:15.271 --> 00:35:16.379
I’ll be right back, okay?

00:35:16.856 --> 00:35:18.274
By the way, Clea—

00:35:18.274 --> 00:35:19.442
Go. It’s fine.

00:35:19.442 --> 00:35:20.489
Okay.

00:35:28.451 --> 00:35:30.078
If you’re gonna come here,

00:35:30.078 --> 00:35:32.580
avoid causing trouble, please.

00:35:33.456 --> 00:35:35.458
It’s easier to attract
attention that way.

00:35:35.458 --> 00:35:38.252
And you don’t want
that to happen, right?

00:35:39.837 --> 00:35:40.838
I’m sorry.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.381
I’m really sorry about earlier.

00:35:42.381 --> 00:35:43.758
I didn’t mean it.

00:35:44.675 --> 00:35:45.760
It won’t happen again.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.678
I won’t be visiting the
set again. I’m sorry.

00:35:59.899 --> 00:36:00.900
Drink some water first.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.319
I know you got nervous.
And change your shirt.

00:36:05.196 --> 00:36:06.864
Coffee spilled on you, too.

00:36:10.827 --> 00:36:12.161
You need to look fine.

00:36:13.079 --> 00:36:16.165
If you’re not okay,
then Arkin’s not okay.

00:36:17.792 --> 00:36:20.002
Our next scene is
especially important, too.

00:36:25.216 --> 00:36:26.217
Thanks.

00:36:39.438 --> 00:36:40.523
Ms. Clea?

00:36:40.857 --> 00:36:43.234
We’ll be shooting sequence 21 first.

00:36:43.234 --> 00:36:44.193
Okay, thank you.

00:36:44.193 --> 00:36:45.239
Thank you.

00:37:55.939 --> 00:37:57.056
Wait.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.601
Wear this.

00:37:59.227 --> 00:38:00.228
Trust me.

00:38:00.394 --> 00:38:02.605
I’m doing this to protect
everyone involved.

00:38:07.777 --> 00:38:08.778
Here.

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:12.531
Thank you.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.581
See, Larkin?
I told you before,

00:38:20.581 --> 00:38:23.709
you should always let me
know about things like this.

00:38:23.922 --> 00:38:25.423
You know it’s risky.

00:38:26.425 --> 00:38:28.314
I’m sorry, Sir Matt.

00:38:28.673 --> 00:38:31.133
Yes, yes. I’ll tell you
everything from now on.

00:38:31.133 --> 00:38:34.220
I’m sorry, it won’t
happen again.

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.347
Just make sure, okay?

00:38:37.682 --> 00:38:40.476
Okay, Sir Matt.
Again, I’m really sorry.

00:38:53.489 --> 00:38:54.490
Clea.

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:56.909
Lei, you go out first.

00:38:56.909 --> 00:38:57.576
Okay.

00:38:57.576 --> 00:38:58.536
Thank you.

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:05.418
Thanks for lending your jacket.

00:39:06.043 --> 00:39:07.420
You saved us there.

00:39:09.463 --> 00:39:10.673
What are you thinking?

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:15.261
Dating a fan? I mean—

00:39:15.511 --> 00:39:16.846
She’s not a fan, Clea.

00:39:19.974 --> 00:39:23.519
Via has been my friend
since we were babies.

00:39:24.312 --> 00:39:25.813
She’s been with me
through everything.

00:39:26.439 --> 00:39:27.440
The good times.

00:39:30.026 --> 00:39:31.402
The bad times.

00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:35.197
Back when I was nothing,

00:39:35.573 --> 00:39:37.241
she was the first to support me.

00:39:39.702 --> 00:39:40.703
Via is…

00:39:42.163 --> 00:39:43.998
Via is extremely
important to me.

00:39:44.707 --> 00:39:46.167
I can’t afford to lose her.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:52.048
I didn’t know you
could be this cheesy.

00:39:55.009 --> 00:39:56.302
You really love her, huh?

00:40:00.222 --> 00:40:01.599
So much. Really.

00:40:06.937 --> 00:40:09.231
I understand, Larkin.

00:40:09.899 --> 00:40:11.984
But please be extra careful.

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:15.071
You guys are treading
on dangerous waters.

00:40:16.113 --> 00:40:22.119
Just keep in mind that whatever
you do will affect my career.

00:40:39.011 --> 00:40:39.887
Sorry,

00:40:40.471 --> 00:40:41.889
you look so cute.

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:44.558
But I’m serious

00:40:44.683 --> 00:40:46.435
I’m serious

00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:48.979
Come here.

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:03.911
What is it?

00:41:03.911 --> 00:41:04.912
I just…

00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:08.332
I just wanted to ask
you both something.

00:41:10.418 --> 00:41:11.794
How do you do…

00:41:13.045 --> 00:41:14.046
that?

00:41:15.214 --> 00:41:16.215
That?

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:19.051
That… you know.

00:41:19.718 --> 00:41:20.719
That.

00:41:22.304 --> 00:41:23.347
You mean sex?

00:41:23.347 --> 00:41:24.204
Huh?

00:41:25.641 --> 00:41:27.501
How often do you do it?

00:41:27.726 --> 00:41:30.146
- What about you, Sam?
- And you, Sam?

00:41:30.146 --> 00:41:32.064
How often do you
and Clyden do it?

00:41:32.064 --> 00:41:34.650
We used to do it
around five times a week.

00:41:34.942 --> 00:41:36.318
- Why so many?
- Five times.

00:41:36.318 --> 00:41:37.403
That’s a lot.

00:41:38.112 --> 00:41:39.113
A lot.

00:41:52.835 --> 00:41:53.836
Let’s go, Via.

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.421
Who is that, Via?

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.881
Let’s go.

00:42:00.384 --> 00:42:02.052
Kino, what are you
doing, let go of me!

00:42:02.845 --> 00:42:04.096
What, does it hurt?

00:42:04.305 --> 00:42:05.598
Are you mad?

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:07.975
Does it hurt because
you’re jealous?
