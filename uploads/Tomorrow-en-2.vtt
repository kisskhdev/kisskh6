WEBVTT

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:27.127
From now on,
I’ll always pay for your fare.

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.963
As long as we go to school
together every day.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:32.883
But we already always go
to school together everyday.

00:00:32.883 --> 00:00:34.551
Since pre-school even, right?

00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:35.969
Then we should keep it
that way until college.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.762
And when we start working,
we’ll still go together.

00:00:37.762 --> 00:00:38.722
No excuses.

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:41.516
We’ll always be with you, okay?
You can’t be alone.

00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:42.142
Why me?

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.369
Well, you’re our friend now.
You don’t have a choice.

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:46.716
Fifty pesos worth
of kwek-kwek, please.

00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:47.797
Who are you?

00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:50.156
And who are you?

00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:52.642
Kierra, Luna, Via,

00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:53.960
and Via’s best friend.

00:00:56.114 --> 00:00:57.115
Oh no, Via!

00:00:57.115 --> 00:00:58.283
Via? Are you sure you’re okay?

00:00:58.283 --> 00:00:59.576
How many fingers? How many?

00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:00.779
Ten.

00:01:00.804 --> 00:01:02.389
Oh no, she’s dumb now!

00:01:03.653 --> 00:01:04.654
Where’s the clinic?

00:01:04.873 --> 00:01:07.167
That girl’s just
obsessed with me.

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:10.045
She’s doing everything she can
to ruin what we have.

00:01:11.513 --> 00:01:12.827
What’s so funny?

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.215
You’ve got some nerve!

00:01:14.215 --> 00:01:15.300
I haven’t even
kissed anyone yet!

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.509
Here, let me give you
your first kiss then.

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:17.469
- You’re disgusting!
- Luna!

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:18.970
- You’re disgusting!
- Luna, that’s enough!

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.764
- Yeah, I said you’re trash.
- Huh?

00:02:34.444 --> 00:02:35.737
- I’m trash?
- Yes!

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.565
You fucking bitch!

00:02:50.718 --> 00:02:51.851
Kino!

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:55.900
Kino, that’s enough!

00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:01.072
Kino, don’t do it.

00:03:02.824 --> 00:03:03.825
Kino—

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.163
- Kino, don’t!
- Bro!

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:15.045
What were you thinking?

00:03:15.045 --> 00:03:16.421
Do you want to get suspended?

00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:20.481
I was just trying to scare him,
I wasn’t really going to do it.

00:03:21.094 --> 00:03:22.387
What happened?

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.692
Via? Are you okay?

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.613
All right, I’ll just think that
the jerk who ran off is at fault.

00:03:29.613 --> 00:03:30.990
Because it really
was that idiot’s fault!

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.158
He's a pig!
Do you even know that?

00:03:32.158 --> 00:03:34.368
He started it, Kino didn’t
do anything wrong.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.581
Are you all okay?

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:41.542
Guys!

00:03:41.542 --> 00:03:44.170
Oh my gosh, guys!
I’ve been looking for you.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.921
They’re announcing
the partial results

00:03:45.921 --> 00:03:49.175
of the election and so far,
we’re currently leading—

00:03:50.556 --> 00:03:51.656
What happened to you?

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:53.858
Did something happen?

00:03:54.482 --> 00:03:56.484
Looks like some
post-election drama, huh?

00:03:59.935 --> 00:04:02.271
I think your party’s gonna win.
Congrats in advance.

00:04:02.271 --> 00:04:05.370
So, what events are
you guys planning next?

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:07.105
There’s foundation
week next month.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.716
That’s the one with
the yearly pageant, right?

00:04:09.741 --> 00:04:11.884
Yeah, Miss Valerian.
You should join that.

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:12.702
Ouch!

00:04:12.727 --> 00:04:13.797
Yeah.

00:04:14.283 --> 00:04:15.993
So, guys, what
actually happened?

00:04:17.036 --> 00:04:19.246
Come on, I’ll tell you.
It’s a long story.

00:04:19.413 --> 00:04:20.414
Let’s go.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.941
How are you?

00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:25.568
You okay?

00:04:26.085 --> 00:04:27.378
Why did you get into a fight?

00:04:28.109 --> 00:04:29.527
Look what happened to you.

00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:31.124
Does it hurt?

00:04:31.614 --> 00:04:32.769
Huh?

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:38.821
Let me see.

00:04:39.374 --> 00:04:40.469
Does it hurt?

00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:42.419
Why did you have to—

00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:45.805
Why did you do that, Kino?

00:04:46.866 --> 00:04:48.743
What if a teacher caught you?

00:04:50.305 --> 00:04:51.360
Wait a sec.

00:04:52.554 --> 00:04:53.555
I’m good. I’m good.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.017
He hurt you.
So, I’ll hurt him back.

00:04:57.126 --> 00:05:00.713
Good thing Sam and Sevi are
nice and didn’t tell on you.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.291
When Sam found out
what happened,

00:05:04.316 --> 00:05:06.193
even she wanted
to go after that jerk.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:07.691
She wanted to
throw in a punch, too.

00:05:07.861 --> 00:05:08.862
Kino!

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:12.430
Don’t do it again, okay?
Don’t ever do that again!

00:05:12.866 --> 00:05:13.784
You want me to
just stand there

00:05:13.784 --> 00:05:15.786
while that jerk had
you by the collar?

00:05:17.162 --> 00:05:20.290
If I ever see him at school,
I’ll make sure he regrets it.

00:05:25.326 --> 00:05:28.037
Still, you shouldn’t do that.

00:05:28.632 --> 00:05:30.550
What if you get expelled?

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.095
You should look after yourself.

00:05:36.265 --> 00:05:37.683
Come on, let me see.

00:05:38.934 --> 00:05:40.227
Does it still hurt?

00:06:03.166 --> 00:06:04.334
No, it doesn’t.

00:06:05.794 --> 00:06:08.171
Huh? You just said it did.

00:06:08.171 --> 00:06:09.798
It’s fine now.
It doesn’t hurt anymore.

00:06:10.299 --> 00:06:11.501
Thank you.

00:06:11.648 --> 00:06:12.649
Hey, Via.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.611
Pa!

00:06:14.636 --> 00:06:15.637
Pa.

00:06:17.264 --> 00:06:18.782
What happened to your lip?

00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:20.012
Did you get into a fight?

00:06:20.527 --> 00:06:21.528
Yes, Pa.

00:06:23.324 --> 00:06:25.618
Pa, wait. Aidan’s crying,
hold on—

00:06:28.275 --> 00:06:29.651
Why did you get into a fight?

00:06:29.676 --> 00:06:33.680
Didn't I tell you and Via
not to start any trouble?

00:06:33.931 --> 00:06:36.308
See, it looks like
things got physical.

00:06:36.517 --> 00:06:38.010
Pa, someone picked
a fight with Via.

00:06:38.035 --> 00:06:39.494
I couldn’t hold myself back.

00:06:39.786 --> 00:06:42.122
But Via already
scolded me for it.

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:45.876
Still, just don’t do
that again, okay?

00:06:45.901 --> 00:06:46.764
Yes, Pa.

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:49.751
But thanks for
standing up for my child.

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:53.579
Via’s lucky to have you.

00:06:54.391 --> 00:06:56.393
I’m the lucky one
to have Via, Pa.

00:06:56.798 --> 00:06:59.634
I would actually
get into a fight for Via.

00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:01.016
Arkin!

00:07:01.114 --> 00:07:02.532
Sorry, Pa. I was just joking.

00:07:03.226 --> 00:07:05.645
And the guy you fought?
Did you beat him up?

00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:07.009
Good, that’s how it should be.

00:07:07.285 --> 00:07:08.735
But don’t do it again, okay?

00:07:08.787 --> 00:07:10.327
Don’t ever do it again.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:12.919
Jeez.

00:07:12.944 --> 00:07:13.945
This is nothing.

00:07:14.081 --> 00:07:17.460
His was worse, he had
one here and here too.

00:07:19.465 --> 00:07:22.830
I told you guys you’d win. See?

00:07:27.665 --> 00:07:28.877
Congratulations!

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:32.839
Guys, we need to celebrate!

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.762
We’re celebrating!
We’re eating out!

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.593
Let’s celebrate
Luna’s freedom, too!

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.193
Pres said he’s treating us, right?
You promised!

00:07:46.529 --> 00:07:48.902
I’m treating everyone at
Wing Zone. Come on, let’s go!

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.125
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.681
I’ll be right back, okay?

00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:56.738
Congratulations!

00:07:56.738 --> 00:07:57.739
Hey, Yanna!

00:07:57.739 --> 00:08:00.461
We won! We won!

00:08:00.733 --> 00:08:01.901
Well, congratulations.

00:08:01.926 --> 00:08:03.844
Hope you don’t end up corrupt.

00:08:04.514 --> 00:08:07.016
Hey, you’re joining the
Miss Valerian pageant.

00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:08.751
You don’t have a choice
anymore, I signed you up.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.701
Go ahead, try me.

00:08:11.795 --> 00:08:13.213
You’ll see.

00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:18.992
You got nothing on her, bro.

00:08:19.017 --> 00:08:20.935
Dude, I really thought
she was gonna kiss me.

00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:24.125
Why were you teasing her?
You’re crazy.

00:08:24.808 --> 00:08:25.809
Come here.

00:08:30.522 --> 00:08:32.524
I usually feel uncomfortable

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:35.051
when I’m surrounded
by a lot of people.

00:08:35.324 --> 00:08:37.188
But when I’m with them,

00:08:37.873 --> 00:08:39.548
I feel really happy.

00:08:39.573 --> 00:08:41.423
Oh right, Via, don’t you
have a game today?

00:08:41.448 --> 00:08:42.551
Can we come watch?

00:08:42.576 --> 00:08:43.869
Huh? No, you might be—

00:08:43.869 --> 00:08:44.536
- I want to watch!
- Right!

00:08:44.536 --> 00:08:45.287
- No, maybe—
- Let’s watch!

00:08:45.287 --> 00:08:46.246
You guys might be busy.

00:08:46.246 --> 00:08:46.788
- You might be busy.
- Let’s watch!

00:08:46.788 --> 00:08:47.330
No, no…

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.290
- Hey!
- Busy—

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:49.332
Via has a volleyball game,

00:08:49.332 --> 00:08:50.625
so everyone’s required to watch!

00:08:50.625 --> 00:08:51.626
- Yes!
- Everyone’s required to watch.

00:08:51.626 --> 00:08:53.295
- Let’s go! Via, Via!
- Game! I’m watching too.

00:08:54.463 --> 00:08:55.839
You’ve got your
own cheering squad.

00:08:55.839 --> 00:08:57.174
Let’s go!

00:08:57.424 --> 00:08:58.758
We’re her cheerleaders!

00:08:58.758 --> 00:09:04.347
- Via!
- Via!

00:09:07.345 --> 00:09:08.268
Go, Via!

00:09:08.268 --> 00:09:09.561
All right!
That’s it.

00:09:10.011 --> 00:09:11.663
Face here a bit. Good angle!

00:09:11.688 --> 00:09:13.982
Go, Via!

00:09:14.316 --> 00:09:15.650
Via!

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.595
Let’s go, Via!

00:09:19.029 --> 00:09:20.030
Oh my god!

00:09:25.728 --> 00:09:27.980
Go, Via!
Go, Via!

00:09:30.248 --> 00:09:32.209
That’s my friend!

00:09:34.878 --> 00:09:35.879
Let’s go, Via!

00:09:37.513 --> 00:09:40.057
All right, that’s it!

00:09:41.384 --> 00:09:42.485
Nice one!

00:09:44.135 --> 00:09:45.989
Go, Via! That’s my friend!

00:09:46.014 --> 00:09:47.349
– That’s my friend!
– What? You’re friends with Via?

00:09:47.349 --> 00:09:48.350
You’re not her friend.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.643
Hey! I’m friends with Via too!

00:09:49.643 --> 00:09:50.894
- No! I’m friends with Via!
- What?

00:09:50.894 --> 00:09:52.270
- She’s my friend!
- She’s my friend, too!

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:52.771
Guys!

00:09:52.771 --> 00:09:54.231
- Via!
- Stop fighting!

00:09:54.689 --> 00:09:56.066
Valeria High on three—

00:09:56.066 --> 00:09:58.401
One, two, three, Valeria!

00:09:58.964 --> 00:10:00.549
-Let’s go, Via!
- Let’s just watch.

00:10:00.574 --> 00:10:02.117
- Let’s go, Via.
- Go, Via.

00:10:02.889 --> 00:10:05.592
Look here for a second.
It’s a good angle.

00:10:05.617 --> 00:10:07.244
Just a bit.
I just need one shot!

00:10:07.244 --> 00:10:08.326
So beautiful.

00:10:08.351 --> 00:10:09.686
One more shot!

00:10:09.827 --> 00:10:10.828
That’s it!

00:10:10.853 --> 00:10:12.182
Kino, you’re confusing me.

00:10:12.207 --> 00:10:13.959
Can you stop taking
so many pictures?

00:10:18.004 --> 00:10:19.756
- Go, Via!
- Let’s go, go, go.

00:10:19.756 --> 00:10:21.299
- Let’s go.
- Go, go, go.

00:10:21.299 --> 00:10:23.385
Hit that ball, Via!

00:10:23.385 --> 00:10:25.971
Imagine that ball is my face!

00:10:41.528 --> 00:10:44.322
You’re the best, Via!
You’re the best!

00:10:44.322 --> 00:10:46.324
You’re such a good player!

00:10:47.033 --> 00:10:48.034
Oh my god!

00:10:48.183 --> 00:10:49.184
Oh my god!

00:10:50.495 --> 00:10:51.496
Go, Via!

00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:53.832
Oh my god!

00:10:53.832 --> 00:10:55.584
Marry me, Via!

00:10:55.584 --> 00:10:57.127
Treat us later!

00:10:57.127 --> 00:10:58.503
My best friend’s amazing!

00:10:58.503 --> 00:10:59.671
Oh my god!

00:11:00.005 --> 00:11:00.797
You’re amazing, Via.

00:11:00.797 --> 00:11:03.133
You’re amazing. So amazing.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.634
You’re so amazing.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.762
Next time, don’t watch
my game, okay?

00:11:07.762 --> 00:11:09.055
You’re too distracting.

00:11:09.646 --> 00:11:11.440
You’re mad at me
for cheering for you.

00:11:11.933 --> 00:11:12.976
You’re so noisy, and
you keep moving around.

00:11:12.976 --> 00:11:15.854
You’re amazing, Via!
You’re a legend!

00:11:17.731 --> 00:11:19.441
That’s my friend!

00:11:21.568 --> 00:11:23.153
Congratulations!

00:11:25.318 --> 00:11:26.402
This is nice.

00:11:26.656 --> 00:11:29.034
So this is what it feels like
to have someone support me

00:11:29.034 --> 00:11:30.577
besides Kino.

00:11:31.202 --> 00:11:32.912
- Are you gonna keep moving around?
- No.

00:11:32.912 --> 00:11:34.122
- Are you gonna be noisy?
- No more.

00:11:34.122 --> 00:11:35.498
- I promise.
- Okay.

00:11:39.705 --> 00:11:42.040
Let me see it.
Come on, just a peek.

00:11:42.088 --> 00:11:43.048
Not yet—

00:11:43.048 --> 00:11:44.549
- It’s a surprise.
- I said let me see!

00:11:44.549 --> 00:11:46.635
Just wait for it in
the school paper.

00:11:47.719 --> 00:11:48.637
Let me see!

00:11:48.637 --> 00:11:51.139
If you actually give them
ugly pictures of me,

00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:54.643
don’t you ever
talk to me again.

00:11:54.643 --> 00:11:56.399
They look good, seriously.

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:57.676
Don’t you trust my shots?

00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:00.579
Besides, you’re pretty, Via.
Don’t worry.

00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:07.727
You’re ugly.

00:12:09.716 --> 00:12:11.217
I literally just called you pretty

00:12:11.242 --> 00:12:13.078
and now you’re insulting me?

00:12:13.078 --> 00:12:15.455
You’re heartless,
Avianna Diaz.

00:12:15.455 --> 00:12:16.873
You were so loud earlier!

00:12:17.248 --> 00:12:19.334
You’re mad that
I cheered for you?

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:22.754
You’ve got such an attitude,
Avianna Rye Diaz.

00:12:24.756 --> 00:12:27.509
Hi, Arkin.

00:12:32.737 --> 00:12:34.239
Such a heartthrob.

00:12:36.184 --> 00:12:37.298
They’re just messing with me.

00:12:38.311 --> 00:12:39.646
I think they like you.

00:12:40.063 --> 00:12:41.439
I bet that girl
has a crush on you.

00:12:41.439 --> 00:12:42.982
Or maybe both of them
have a crush on you.

00:12:44.025 --> 00:12:48.530
Well, it’s understandable.
I am good-looking.

00:12:58.039 --> 00:13:00.250
Kino, do you have a crush?

00:13:05.588 --> 00:13:06.589
Crush?

00:13:10.343 --> 00:13:12.011
Not really. You?

00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:15.220
None. I’m not even
thinking about that stuff.

00:13:16.641 --> 00:13:18.476
When do you plan
on getting a girlfriend?

00:13:20.019 --> 00:13:21.855
Maybe when we’re
in our fourth year?

00:13:23.196 --> 00:13:24.906
Maybe when

00:13:26.093 --> 00:13:27.928
someone actually courts me.

00:13:34.625 --> 00:13:35.635
And you?

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.746
When do you plan
on getting a boyfriend?

00:13:37.902 --> 00:13:39.188
When someone courts you?

00:13:39.634 --> 00:13:42.625
I’m not thinking
about that either.

00:13:42.625 --> 00:13:44.079
And no one’s courting me anyway.

00:13:44.104 --> 00:13:46.064
No one’s going to court me.

00:13:52.645 --> 00:13:54.022
All right, same routine.

00:13:54.494 --> 00:13:55.578
I know you’re tired.

00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:57.330
Here.

00:13:57.974 --> 00:14:00.060
He still acts like he’s
in grade school.

00:14:00.393 --> 00:14:02.729
I don’t even know how
he’ll ever get a girlfriend.

00:14:02.729 --> 00:14:04.898
One— Two, three!

00:14:06.623 --> 00:14:07.542
You’re so light.

00:14:07.567 --> 00:14:08.568
Kino.

00:14:08.568 --> 00:14:09.277
Huh?

00:14:09.277 --> 00:14:11.112
A lot of people have
a crush on you, right?

00:14:11.112 --> 00:14:11.738
So?

00:14:11.738 --> 00:14:13.698
But they have no idea
that you’re childish.

00:14:14.783 --> 00:14:15.533
Right?

00:14:15.533 --> 00:14:16.117
Oh really?

00:14:16.117 --> 00:14:17.118
Yeah, you’re childish.

00:14:17.118 --> 00:14:18.119
- I’m childish?
- You are.

00:14:18.119 --> 00:14:20.121
- So I’m childish, huh?
- Childish!

00:14:20.705 --> 00:14:22.680
- Kino!
- So I’m really childish, huh?

00:14:26.127 --> 00:14:27.562
Guess I’m childish then.

00:14:27.587 --> 00:14:28.963
Hey, put me down!

00:14:29.297 --> 00:14:30.757
She said I’m childish!

00:14:30.757 --> 00:14:32.634
You are childish!

00:14:32.634 --> 00:14:34.385
Speed racer!

00:14:38.223 --> 00:14:40.058
Okay, we only have
three weeks left

00:14:40.058 --> 00:14:42.274
before Foundation Week.

00:14:42.299 --> 00:14:45.121
So, obviously, we’re working
on a tight schedule.

00:14:45.146 --> 00:14:47.023
As early as now,
I want to thank everyone

00:14:47.023 --> 00:14:50.693
who has helped out, showed up,
and volunteered.

00:14:50.693 --> 00:14:54.197
Thank you so much, I really
appreciate all of you.

00:14:54.197 --> 00:14:55.490
I’ve already talked
to the club presidents,

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.410
and so far the
confirmed booths are—

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:00.620
the Dedication booth is one,

00:15:01.079 --> 00:15:04.123
the Marriage Booth,
and the Horror Booth.

00:15:04.833 --> 00:15:06.125
And for our main event,

00:15:06.125 --> 00:15:09.504
which is the annual
Miss Valerian—

00:15:10.129 --> 00:15:12.340
Luna and Sevi, you guys are
spearheading, right?

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.352
Any updates?

00:15:13.377 --> 00:15:14.676
Yes, Pres.

00:15:14.676 --> 00:15:16.845
The Music Club’s performance
is confirmed.

00:15:17.262 --> 00:15:20.181
Via, isn’t Arkin a member
of the Music Club?

00:15:20.181 --> 00:15:21.349
Is he performing too?

00:15:21.808 --> 00:15:22.809
Maybe.

00:15:22.809 --> 00:15:25.812
That’s cool. It’ll be my first
time hearing him play.

00:15:25.812 --> 00:15:27.188
I didn’t expect him
to be into music.

00:15:27.188 --> 00:15:28.147
He doesn’t look like it.

00:15:28.172 --> 00:15:30.124
He looks more like
a troublemaker, right?

00:15:30.149 --> 00:15:32.902
But Kino’s actually
really talented,

00:15:32.902 --> 00:15:34.070
and he’s smart, too.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.739
Wow, look at you
praising your best friend.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.286
Anyway, we already have
the list of contestants.

00:15:41.286 --> 00:15:44.956
For first year, it’s Helena.
Second year, Irish.

00:15:44.956 --> 00:15:46.374
Third year, Yanna.

00:15:46.374 --> 00:15:48.501
Wait, is it really
okay for Yanna

00:15:48.501 --> 00:15:49.419
to join the pageant,

00:15:49.419 --> 00:15:51.713
knowing her image in
school isn’t exactly great?

00:15:51.713 --> 00:15:54.465
That’s my concern too,
because if she wins,

00:15:54.465 --> 00:15:56.843
she’ll basically
represent the school.

00:15:56.843 --> 00:15:58.899
If she wins, I mean.

00:15:59.387 --> 00:16:00.680
Is it okay for someone like her

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.056
to be the school’s representative?

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:04.434
Why? What’s wrong with her?

00:16:05.018 --> 00:16:07.520
I mean, for one, she’s boy crazy.

00:16:09.321 --> 00:16:10.697
Any proof of that?

00:16:10.722 --> 00:16:12.682
Well, that’s what a lot
of people are saying.

00:16:12.707 --> 00:16:13.875
That’s just hearsay.

00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:16.613
I think it’s unfair for Yanna

00:16:16.613 --> 00:16:18.615
if we don’t give her a
chance to show her talent

00:16:18.615 --> 00:16:21.618
and capabilities just
because of malicious rumors.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.453
Pres, if I may?

00:16:23.453 --> 00:16:25.246
I just want to remind everyone

00:16:25.246 --> 00:16:27.332
that we’re all student
leaders here.

00:16:27.874 --> 00:16:32.378
We shouldn’t be adding to
or encouraging toxic rumors

00:16:32.378 --> 00:16:34.797
or hate trains against
other students.

00:16:35.298 --> 00:16:36.674
It’s also a form of bullying.

00:16:39.135 --> 00:16:41.262
And that’s on period.

00:16:41.596 --> 00:16:42.597
You nailed it, Sam.

00:16:43.647 --> 00:16:44.648
Your spit’s flying everywhere.

00:16:44.673 --> 00:16:46.159
I’m all yours, Sam.

00:16:46.184 --> 00:16:47.977
I’ll follow you everywhere.

00:16:48.186 --> 00:16:49.967
So, no more issues with Yanna?

00:16:49.992 --> 00:16:50.743
Yes.

00:16:50.768 --> 00:16:52.436
- Okay! Perfect.
- There. Of course.

00:16:52.688 --> 00:16:53.689
Thank you, Sam.

00:16:54.108 --> 00:16:55.985
Guys, this is for everybody.

00:16:56.534 --> 00:16:59.955
We should all lead by
example. Okay? Take note.

00:17:00.281 --> 00:17:01.699
- Good example.
- Anyway—

00:17:01.699 --> 00:17:04.243
My vote for Pres
didn’t go to waste.

00:17:22.637 --> 00:17:23.667
No good.

00:17:43.825 --> 00:17:45.066
What’s the problem?

00:17:46.703 --> 00:17:47.887
How long have you
been standing there?

00:17:47.912 --> 00:17:48.913
Just a bit.

00:17:49.511 --> 00:17:53.214
We have this song with
a bridge that uses the chord B7.

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:54.949
My bandmate taught me this.

00:17:59.298 --> 00:18:00.174
But it sounds kinda off.

00:18:00.174 --> 00:18:01.884
I can’t press it properly.

00:18:01.884 --> 00:18:03.344
Here, on the bar chord.

00:18:03.344 --> 00:18:04.378
You really can’t press it down.

00:18:04.403 --> 00:18:06.655
There’s another way though.
You can do it like this.

00:18:07.515 --> 00:18:08.516
Here.

00:18:08.975 --> 00:18:09.976
No.

00:18:09.976 --> 00:18:10.977
Put it here.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.646
Isn’t that easier?

00:18:18.254 --> 00:18:19.502
There you go.

00:18:19.527 --> 00:18:20.737
Not like that. Here.

00:18:20.737 --> 00:18:21.779
Right there.

00:18:23.031 --> 00:18:24.323
There.

00:18:25.658 --> 00:18:27.702
Try again. Strum.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:38.921
There you go.

00:18:42.592 --> 00:18:44.135
Doesn’t it sound better?

00:18:45.647 --> 00:18:46.440
Right?

00:18:46.465 --> 00:18:47.883
Okay, okay, I got it now.

00:18:49.432 --> 00:18:52.018
I got the B7 chords.

00:18:52.852 --> 00:18:53.853
Why do you look so red?

00:18:54.499 --> 00:18:55.663
You okay?

00:18:55.905 --> 00:18:56.982
Are you sick?

00:18:57.007 --> 00:18:58.717
Do you have a fever?
You feel warm.

00:18:59.815 --> 00:19:02.025
It’s kinda hot in this room.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.427
Maybe it’s the aircon.

00:19:03.452 --> 00:19:04.703
But it’s on.

00:19:05.323 --> 00:19:06.324
No, no.

00:19:06.991 --> 00:19:08.117
Let me see.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:15.291
I’m fine.

00:19:15.291 --> 00:19:17.335
Is there something wrong with me?

00:19:17.335 --> 00:19:18.544
Your face is red.

00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:24.539
Maybe… maybe…

00:19:24.564 --> 00:19:25.481
Maybe what?

00:19:25.506 --> 00:19:27.175
Maybe we should go home.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:27.804
Let’s go.

00:19:27.829 --> 00:19:28.960
All right.

00:19:31.891 --> 00:19:32.558
Let’s go.

00:19:32.558 --> 00:19:33.643
You’re not leaving that behind?

00:19:41.199 --> 00:19:43.118
Luna: Foundation Week
starts today!

00:19:43.143 --> 00:19:45.437
Pageant day! Are we all ready?
Kierra: Wow, you’re up early.

00:19:45.462 --> 00:19:48.423
Kierra: Via, you on your way?
Kierra: Via?

00:19:48.448 --> 00:19:49.452
Via?

00:19:50.076 --> 00:19:51.452
Oh come on.

00:19:51.869 --> 00:19:52.870
Hey, Via!

00:19:57.028 --> 00:19:58.738
Via, wake up! Look at the time.

00:19:58.763 --> 00:20:00.056
We’re gonna be late!

00:20:00.503 --> 00:20:01.838
If we don’t make it
to the pageant,

00:20:01.838 --> 00:20:03.089
Luna’s gonna kill you.

00:20:03.089 --> 00:20:04.140
What?

00:20:04.841 --> 00:20:06.926
What time is it?

00:20:12.219 --> 00:20:13.257
We’re late.

00:20:13.282 --> 00:20:14.325
Yeah, we’re late.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:14.851
We’re late!

00:20:14.851 --> 00:20:15.810
- We’re late!
- Their lunch boxes!

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.019
No, I’ll take care of it.
Don't worry.

00:20:17.019 --> 00:20:18.521
- Go shower and get dressed.
- Huh? What about their lunch—

00:20:18.521 --> 00:20:19.897
- I’ll take care of it.
- Huh?

00:20:22.504 --> 00:20:24.839
I am so glad
you’re here, seriously.

00:20:25.525 --> 00:20:26.526
Wait for me, okay?

00:20:29.405 --> 00:20:30.312
I’ll be quick.

00:20:38.287 --> 00:20:39.984
Lunch. Their lunch!

00:20:51.226 --> 00:20:52.727
This one’s probably better.

00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:54.963
There, and then...

00:20:59.898 --> 00:21:00.899
Arkin—

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.390
why is my hotdog burnt?

00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:07.278
That’s not burnt,

00:21:07.278 --> 00:21:09.780
it’s toasted so it has a
smoky flavor, you know?

00:21:09.981 --> 00:21:12.734
Then why is my egg burnt too?

00:21:12.759 --> 00:21:14.469
Is that stoated?

00:21:15.176 --> 00:21:16.512
You mean toasted?

00:21:16.537 --> 00:21:17.914
No, it’s not toasted.

00:21:18.414 --> 00:21:20.333
I did this on purpose so
it’s crispy when you eat it.

00:21:20.917 --> 00:21:21.959
Right?

00:21:22.418 --> 00:21:24.086
You guys are just
making fun of my cooking.

00:21:24.086 --> 00:21:25.463
I barely even cook, you know.

00:21:25.463 --> 00:21:27.173
What if I tickle you guys, huh?

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.421
Huh?

00:21:28.841 --> 00:21:30.343
You’re making fun of my cooking.

00:21:30.343 --> 00:21:32.136
This is one of the
few times I’ve cooked,

00:21:32.136 --> 00:21:33.471
and you’re just
going to tease me?

00:21:34.862 --> 00:21:37.240
Hey! What’s taking you
so long? Hurry up already!

00:21:37.265 --> 00:21:38.182
We’re gonna be late.

00:21:38.207 --> 00:21:39.435
Okay, okay, we’re coming.

00:21:39.435 --> 00:21:41.395
Mira, ask Papa
to check on Aiden.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.518
What?

00:21:49.028 --> 00:21:50.026
Nothing.

00:21:50.427 --> 00:21:51.631
Let’s go.

00:21:51.656 --> 00:21:53.199
Hurry up, we’re gonna be late.

00:21:53.449 --> 00:21:54.450
Ysha, have you eaten?

00:21:55.284 --> 00:21:56.285
You’re not hungry?

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:57.094
- No.
- Huh?

00:21:57.119 --> 00:21:58.190
All right then.

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.177
Via, I’ll stop by the music room
to grab my guitar.

00:22:02.202 --> 00:22:03.292
I’ll just check
if someone’s there.

00:22:03.292 --> 00:22:04.502
They’re walking together again?

00:22:04.502 --> 00:22:06.087
Guess she really
is his girlfriend.

00:22:06.837 --> 00:22:08.547
- Too bad, he’s taken.
- Yeah.

00:22:09.215 --> 00:22:10.508
Are they talking about us?

00:22:10.508 --> 00:22:13.094
They’re together again.
They’re always together.

00:22:15.805 --> 00:22:18.182
Kino, did you hear that?

00:22:19.118 --> 00:22:20.383
Huh?

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.034
Nothing. Come on.

00:22:22.551 --> 00:22:23.051
Hurry up.

00:22:23.076 --> 00:22:24.578
Come on, they said
someone’s there.

00:22:26.274 --> 00:22:27.336
Hurry.

00:22:27.504 --> 00:22:30.256
Hey! Arkin brought
his girlfriend.

00:22:30.801 --> 00:22:31.886
You idiot. She’s my friend.

00:22:31.911 --> 00:22:33.120
- Dumbass.
- Okay, if you say so.

00:22:33.145 --> 00:22:34.271
Hey, don’t forget your guitar.

00:22:34.816 --> 00:22:37.235
Those girls earlier
thought the same thing.

00:22:38.139 --> 00:22:39.133
Which ones?

00:22:39.158 --> 00:22:40.618
The ones we passed by.

00:22:40.643 --> 00:22:42.019
They thought
I was your girlfriend.

00:22:42.297 --> 00:22:43.523
Are you okay with that?

00:22:44.625 --> 00:22:46.502
Yeah, I’m fine with it.
How about you?

00:22:46.893 --> 00:22:47.894
Well…

00:22:50.423 --> 00:22:53.134
It’s just that maybe you’ve lost
a few potential love interests

00:22:53.134 --> 00:22:55.303
since they think
I’m your girlfriend.

00:22:55.928 --> 00:22:56.595
Nevermind.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.497
Come on, hurry up.
We’re gonna be late.

00:22:58.889 --> 00:22:59.949
Let’s go!

00:22:59.974 --> 00:23:00.558
Hurry!

00:23:00.558 --> 00:23:02.852
I still need to get the camera.

00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:16.699
All right, but let’s just
improvise our jokes later.

00:23:16.699 --> 00:23:18.868
Okay, fine. Just go with
whatever I do, okay?

00:23:19.838 --> 00:23:20.911
- You okay with that?
- Why me?

00:23:20.911 --> 00:23:21.996
Guys!

00:23:22.496 --> 00:23:23.497
- Hi, Pres!
- Hey, Pres!

00:23:23.497 --> 00:23:24.749
How are you? Hey there.

00:23:24.749 --> 00:23:27.501
By the way, we wanna
make sure the tables

00:23:27.501 --> 00:23:31.088
and scoresheets are
all set before we start.

00:23:31.297 --> 00:23:33.408
Excuse me, I need your help.

00:23:33.632 --> 00:23:36.302
Is the audio okay? Did we
already do a sound check?

00:23:36.327 --> 00:23:38.596
We need to make
sure everything’s ready

00:23:38.596 --> 00:23:40.056
before the program starts, okay?

00:23:40.056 --> 00:23:40.806
Let’s go.

00:23:40.806 --> 00:23:42.058
You guys handle
things here, all right?

00:23:42.641 --> 00:23:43.476
Bye, Pres!

00:23:43.476 --> 00:23:44.452
Bye!

00:23:44.477 --> 00:23:45.478
We got this, Pres.

00:23:47.625 --> 00:23:49.919
You guys are starting to get
on my nerves, you know that?

00:23:49.958 --> 00:23:52.878
Yanna, just let us do
your hair and makeup.

00:23:52.903 --> 00:23:54.905
You can’t go on
stage looking like that.

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:56.265
You look so pale.

00:23:56.297 --> 00:23:58.048
You need a proper
pageant makeup look.

00:23:58.516 --> 00:24:01.770
Yeah, Yanna, just let
us handle it. We got you.

00:24:02.828 --> 00:24:04.580
Why do you all have to meddle?

00:24:05.706 --> 00:24:08.376
I’m in charge of everything
that happens backstage.

00:24:08.376 --> 00:24:10.211
I want this event
to be successful.

00:24:10.211 --> 00:24:13.798
So please, Yanna.
Take this pageant seriously.

00:24:13.798 --> 00:24:15.716
We all worked hard for this.

00:24:17.324 --> 00:24:19.535
Fine. Do whatever you want.

00:24:20.805 --> 00:24:22.390
There’s not much to do anyway.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:23.641
She already looks good.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.541
Just like a lioness.

00:24:26.489 --> 00:24:27.884
Just make it a little darker.

00:24:28.364 --> 00:24:31.200
Yanna, where’s your mom
by the way? Is she coming?

00:24:33.716 --> 00:24:35.050
How about your dad?

00:24:35.444 --> 00:24:36.654
You ask too many questions.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.532
I feel like I should
just take this off.

00:24:39.847 --> 00:24:40.848
Then—

00:24:43.911 --> 00:24:44.912
Much better.

00:24:53.133 --> 00:24:54.134
Some more here?

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:55.160
- Anyway—
- I’ll hold her hair.

00:24:55.235 --> 00:24:59.197
Valerians! Good morning!

00:25:02.146 --> 00:25:03.814
How are you all doing?

00:25:03.839 --> 00:25:05.841
We’re great!

00:25:06.809 --> 00:25:10.729
So, today we’re officially
kicking off our Foundation Week

00:25:10.729 --> 00:25:12.752
with our much awaited event.

00:25:12.777 --> 00:25:15.738
The search for this
year’s Miss Valerian.

00:25:16.085 --> 00:25:18.462
And of course, before we start,
let's welcome

00:25:18.487 --> 00:25:22.032
the president of our student
council, Mr. Acel Chelvea Peña

00:25:22.032 --> 00:25:23.409
for the opening remarks.

00:25:31.074 --> 00:25:32.284
Good morning, everyone!

00:25:35.416 --> 00:25:37.293
On behalf of
the student council,

00:25:37.318 --> 00:25:40.279
we welcome you all to the
Foundation Week celebration.

00:25:40.426 --> 00:25:43.637
Well, someone’s taking
this really seriously, huh?

00:25:44.805 --> 00:25:46.140
Via, stop messing around.

00:25:46.348 --> 00:25:48.434
I heard some of
the freshmen saying

00:25:48.434 --> 00:25:50.728
I look handsome
when I’m serious.

00:25:55.399 --> 00:25:58.152
We have prepared numerous
activities and events

00:25:58.152 --> 00:26:00.905
that will showcase our
talents and school spirit.

00:26:01.197 --> 00:26:02.615
Bringing us closer
as one community.

00:26:02.615 --> 00:26:04.783
Are you serious? Are you sure
that was about you?

00:26:05.106 --> 00:26:07.942
You think I’m lying? I swear
I heard my name.

00:26:07.967 --> 00:26:09.927
They said, Arkin looks handsome
when he’s serious.

00:26:10.706 --> 00:26:13.083
Really? What does your “serious"
look even look like?

00:26:15.085 --> 00:26:17.379
So, let’s make the
most out of this week.

00:26:17.713 --> 00:26:19.757
Happy Foundation Week,
Valerians!

00:26:19.757 --> 00:26:20.799
Enjoy the show.

00:26:23.719 --> 00:26:27.681
Thank you, President Acel for
that heartwarming speech.

00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:30.559
And now, the most
awaited part of the event.

00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:31.894
Let’s all welcome—

00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:35.356
- our Miss Valerian candidates!
- our Miss Valerian candidates!

00:26:41.445 --> 00:26:43.572
You guys are really
good at hosting.

00:26:53.332 --> 00:26:56.377
Wait, where’s Ke?
I’ve been looking for her.

00:26:56.877 --> 00:26:58.587
I think she’s outside
doing something.

00:26:58.587 --> 00:26:59.610
Okay.

00:27:03.551 --> 00:27:04.610
See!

00:27:05.052 --> 00:27:06.387
Let’s go, Yanna!

00:27:17.398 --> 00:27:20.859
Hello, everyone!
I am Helena Hernandez

00:27:20.859 --> 00:27:23.487
representing
the first year batch!

00:27:23.487 --> 00:27:26.782
For me, being a Valerian
means being strong,

00:27:26.782 --> 00:27:28.659
kind and true to yourself.

00:27:28.659 --> 00:27:30.452
And I, thank you.

00:27:45.342 --> 00:27:46.677
She’s your classmate, right?

00:27:47.597 --> 00:27:50.183
Irish? Yeah. She is not nice.

00:27:50.208 --> 00:27:53.003
And that other one?
She’s mean, too.

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:55.194
And he badmouthed them.

00:27:55.219 --> 00:27:56.220
Hello , everyone!

00:27:56.245 --> 00:27:57.162
It’s true.

00:27:57.187 --> 00:27:59.147
I’m Irish Gail Hermosa and today

00:27:59.189 --> 00:28:02.651
I’m here to represent,
second year high batch!

00:28:02.651 --> 00:28:04.278
I’m here to represent the youth

00:28:04.278 --> 00:28:07.364
and show what Valerian
confidence is all about.

00:28:07.364 --> 00:28:09.325
And I, thank you.

00:28:11.118 --> 00:28:13.495
But you know what,
Irish has a crush on me.

00:28:14.038 --> 00:28:15.723
You’re so full of yourself.

00:28:15.748 --> 00:28:19.084
I swear! She confessed to
me just yesterday.

00:28:19.084 --> 00:28:20.151
Really?

00:28:25.536 --> 00:28:26.996
Let’s go, Yanna!

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:46.846
Yanna!

00:28:53.202 --> 00:28:55.948
Hi. I’m Ashianna Kim Fernandez,

00:28:55.973 --> 00:28:58.682
representing
the third year batch.

00:28:58.707 --> 00:29:00.250
Ain’t that delicious!

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:01.960
Let me have a taste!

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.961
Yummy!

00:29:03.504 --> 00:29:04.463
Her skin’s so smooth!

00:29:04.463 --> 00:29:05.547
Are you for sharing?

00:29:05.547 --> 00:29:06.674
Give me a kiss!

00:29:07.591 --> 00:29:09.093
These guys are so rude.

00:29:15.046 --> 00:29:16.923
And I’ll kill you all—

00:29:21.021 --> 00:29:22.314
with kindness.

00:29:22.981 --> 00:29:24.900
Oh… Kindness.

00:29:24.925 --> 00:29:25.940
Okay.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:34.368
Yanna looks so pretty, huh?

00:29:34.368 --> 00:29:36.161
Of course, we’re the
ones who fixed her up.

00:29:36.161 --> 00:29:37.121
Good job!

00:29:42.793 --> 00:29:46.088
Good Day, everyone!
I am Jewel Doria

00:29:46.088 --> 00:29:49.174
representing
the fourth year batch.

00:29:54.972 --> 00:29:56.140
Here.

00:30:02.938 --> 00:30:04.648
Via, is it time for
the talent portion?

00:30:04.648 --> 00:30:06.608
Yeah. I think it’s up next.

00:30:08.944 --> 00:30:12.740
Hey, Yanna! I heard my boyfriend
cheering for you earlier.

00:30:13.824 --> 00:30:15.868
- What?
- You’ve got a lot of nerve.

00:30:17.202 --> 00:30:18.454
How is that my fault?

00:30:18.454 --> 00:30:19.413
Yes.

00:30:19.621 --> 00:30:21.915
Because you’re such a slut!

00:30:22.708 --> 00:30:24.084
- What did you just say?
- I said you’re a slut!

00:30:24.084 --> 00:30:25.043
- You heard me.
- Yanna!

00:30:25.043 --> 00:30:26.295
Excuse me, hello.

00:30:26.295 --> 00:30:29.214
Yanna, get ready
for the talent portion.

00:30:29.214 --> 00:30:31.216
You too, get ready
and get dressed.

00:30:36.847 --> 00:30:38.223
Oh my god!

00:30:38.766 --> 00:30:40.058
I hate her.

00:30:40.476 --> 00:30:42.227
Now that we’ve
met our candidates,

00:30:42.227 --> 00:30:44.438
it’s time to see
another side of them.

00:30:44.438 --> 00:30:46.857
We all know Valerians
are talented students,

00:30:46.857 --> 00:30:50.110
and this segment will
showcase exactly that.

00:30:50.652 --> 00:30:52.029
Welcome to—

00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:53.697
- The Talent Portion!
- The Talent Portion!

00:30:54.364 --> 00:30:57.659
Before we proceed, I’d like
to make a few reminders.

00:30:57.659 --> 00:30:59.953
Please do not make
unnecessary comments

00:30:59.953 --> 00:31:01.747
about our contestants.

00:31:01.747 --> 00:31:05.250
Right, especially stuff
that doesn’t sound nice.

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.711
Remember, being respectful

00:31:07.711 --> 00:31:10.672
is one of Valeria High’s
core values.

00:31:10.672 --> 00:31:11.673
Wow!

00:31:11.673 --> 00:31:16.261
Amazing. My co-host has actually
memorized the school bible!

00:31:17.054 --> 00:31:19.223
And now, let’s officially begin.

00:31:19.223 --> 00:31:21.266
Representing the first years,

00:31:21.266 --> 00:31:23.936
she’ll be performing
a hip hop dance number.

00:31:23.936 --> 00:31:25.938
Let’s all give a warm
round of applause

00:31:25.938 --> 00:31:27.940
for Miss Helena Hernandez.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:45.916
She’s so good.

00:31:45.916 --> 00:31:46.542
I know, I know.

00:31:46.542 --> 00:31:47.209
You can do that.

00:31:47.209 --> 00:31:48.544
- Do a sing-off.
- No, we’re here for Yanna.

00:31:48.544 --> 00:31:49.545
- Right!
- You’re right.

00:31:49.545 --> 00:31:50.559
We’re here for Yanna.

00:31:57.135 --> 00:31:58.168
Mother!

00:31:58.929 --> 00:31:59.930
Mother—

00:32:07.521 --> 00:32:08.522
Go, Yanna!

00:32:30.168 --> 00:32:32.087
Just one night, Yanna!

00:32:32.838 --> 00:32:33.589
Me too, Yanna!

00:32:33.589 --> 00:32:34.856
Dance for me!

00:32:36.091 --> 00:32:36.842
Excuse me,

00:32:36.842 --> 00:32:38.886
didn’t we just say that
we should all respect

00:32:38.886 --> 00:32:40.345
the contestants?

00:32:40.345 --> 00:32:41.847
The teachers are
right there on the side.

00:32:41.847 --> 00:32:43.473
I can report you anytime.

00:32:46.583 --> 00:32:47.834
Such a killjoy.

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:52.058
Hey.

00:33:07.581 --> 00:33:08.665
She’s really good.

00:33:08.665 --> 00:33:09.731
A sure win.

00:33:14.968 --> 00:33:17.804
We’ve seen our candidates
showcase their talents.

00:33:18.133 --> 00:33:20.469
And now it’s time to hear
what they have to say.

00:33:20.886 --> 00:33:21.803
Welcome to—

00:33:21.929 --> 00:33:23.764
- The Q&A Portion!
- The Q&A Portion!

00:33:28.393 --> 00:33:31.521
For this portion, candidates
will be picked randomly.

00:33:31.521 --> 00:33:34.191
Let’s begin with
Ashianna Kim Fernandez

00:33:34.191 --> 00:33:35.692
from the third year batch.

00:33:44.242 --> 00:33:45.327
What happened?

00:33:45.577 --> 00:33:46.870
Yanna isn’t here yet.

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:47.537
Huh?

00:33:47.746 --> 00:33:50.707
I don’t know either, but
they’re calling her on stage.

00:33:50.707 --> 00:33:52.059
- Yanna?
- Yes.

00:33:52.084 --> 00:33:53.251
Isn’t she here?

00:33:53.251 --> 00:33:54.878
Wasn’t she supposed
to enter from over there?

00:33:56.588 --> 00:33:58.215
She’s not there.

00:34:15.816 --> 00:34:17.150
Maybe she got stuck in traffic.

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:18.110
Let’s call her again.

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:20.570
Miss Ashianna Kim Fernandez!

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.590
There she is! Oh my gosh.

00:34:45.345 --> 00:34:47.305
What’s that? What does it say?

00:34:47.305 --> 00:34:48.682
It says she’s a flirt?

00:34:48.682 --> 00:34:50.559
At least she admits it, right?

00:34:51.059 --> 00:34:53.186
Yanna, are you okay?

00:34:53.186 --> 00:34:54.329
Are you sure?

00:34:54.354 --> 00:34:56.398
I wish you’d flirt with me, Yanna.

00:34:56.773 --> 00:34:58.692
Poor girl.

00:35:01.486 --> 00:35:02.487
You sure?

00:35:02.738 --> 00:35:03.739
Are you sure?

00:35:03.739 --> 00:35:04.756
Okay.

00:35:08.869 --> 00:35:10.454
Okay, Miss Ashianna—

00:35:10.746 --> 00:35:12.914
Please choose from
the question cards.

00:35:20.547 --> 00:35:22.132
Your question is—

00:35:22.606 --> 00:35:24.733
What does feminism mean to you,

00:35:24.758 --> 00:35:28.929
and how can students like us
practice it in our everyday lives?

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:35.020
For me,

00:35:35.752 --> 00:35:41.007
feminism isn’t about
competing with men

00:35:41.985 --> 00:35:44.738
or being above them.

00:35:45.996 --> 00:35:51.460
Its true meaning is equality.

00:35:52.412 --> 00:35:57.459
Equal respect and
opportunities for everyone.

00:35:58.316 --> 00:35:59.776
As students,

00:36:00.796 --> 00:36:06.760
we can live this out by
showing respect to one another

00:36:07.852 --> 00:36:09.729
and not judging someone

00:36:10.617 --> 00:36:12.327
based on their clothing,

00:36:13.141 --> 00:36:14.309
speech,

00:36:15.333 --> 00:36:16.334
actions,

00:36:17.229 --> 00:36:18.814
or background.

00:36:22.171 --> 00:36:24.590
And for my fellow women,

00:36:26.154 --> 00:36:31.785
feminism isn’t about
pulling each other down.

00:36:34.691 --> 00:36:40.072
It’s about working together
so that everyone rises together.

00:36:45.644 --> 00:36:46.896
And I, thank you.

00:36:56.066 --> 00:36:57.318
Yes!

00:37:04.067 --> 00:37:06.570
But, oh my god—

00:37:10.031 --> 00:37:11.158
- Wait a minute.
- Huh?

00:37:15.554 --> 00:37:16.656
True.

00:37:16.681 --> 00:37:17.914
Were you the one
who wrote that?

00:37:17.914 --> 00:37:19.619
Girl, she really is a slut.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.293
It suits her.

00:37:21.585 --> 00:37:22.335
Yeah.

00:37:22.335 --> 00:37:23.837
Oh my god.

00:37:23.837 --> 00:37:25.380
- So it’s you?
- What are you doing?

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.381
- Why did you do that? Huh?
- What?

00:37:26.381 --> 00:37:27.090
- Don’t get involved!
- Why?

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:27.757
What do you mean?

00:37:27.757 --> 00:37:28.800
- What did she do to you?
- It’s fine.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.593
Do you have proof?

00:37:29.593 --> 00:37:30.802
- Everyone!
- It’s fine.

00:37:30.802 --> 00:37:32.679
She’s the one who
sabotaged Yanna’s gown.

00:37:32.679 --> 00:37:34.173
- No!
- Sam! Sam!

00:37:34.198 --> 00:37:35.991
- Sam, stop!
- No!

00:37:36.016 --> 00:37:37.809
I will report all of you!

00:37:37.809 --> 00:37:40.103
- I knew you were behind this!
- You’re all so shameless!

00:37:40.103 --> 00:37:41.521
I saw you take her dress.

00:37:41.521 --> 00:37:43.982
I heard you talking about Yanna
in the bathroom.

00:37:44.482 --> 00:37:46.026
Well, she really is a slut.

00:37:46.026 --> 00:37:46.985
What did you say?

00:37:46.985 --> 00:37:48.545
- Hey, stop it—
- What did you just say?

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:49.571
She’s a slut.

00:37:49.821 --> 00:37:51.323
A slut, huh?

00:37:59.748 --> 00:38:01.208
Stop fighting!

00:38:01.958 --> 00:38:03.376
I can handle this.

00:38:03.376 --> 00:38:04.392
Come on!

00:38:05.962 --> 00:38:07.214
That’s enough!

00:38:07.214 --> 00:38:08.215
Stop already!

00:38:09.007 --> 00:38:10.342
Enough already!

00:38:10.342 --> 00:38:11.447
Enough!

00:38:15.148 --> 00:38:16.357
Hold her!

00:38:17.307 --> 00:38:18.767
- I will report you!
- Sam!

00:38:18.767 --> 00:38:20.977
- No, I’ll report them!
- Enough!

00:38:22.562 --> 00:38:24.522
Guys! What’s going on here?

00:38:25.732 --> 00:38:26.733
What is this?

00:38:29.611 --> 00:38:30.697
Yanna?

00:38:31.112 --> 00:38:32.113
Excuse me.

00:38:32.614 --> 00:38:33.323
Yanna!

00:38:33.323 --> 00:38:34.216
Excuse me.

00:38:34.241 --> 00:38:35.290
You guys!

00:38:36.243 --> 00:38:39.537
Calm down. Relax. Inhale…

00:38:39.537 --> 00:38:40.997
Exhale. All good?

00:38:41.388 --> 00:38:42.389
You guys too.

00:38:42.414 --> 00:38:43.415
Enough.

00:38:43.466 --> 00:38:44.434
Wait.

00:38:44.459 --> 00:38:45.460
Excuse me.

00:38:47.545 --> 00:38:48.713
I said, enough!

00:38:49.714 --> 00:38:50.715
Warfreaks.

00:38:51.098 --> 00:38:53.600
Arkin? You’re involved
in this too?

00:38:54.344 --> 00:38:55.595
Huh? Why me?

00:38:56.221 --> 00:38:57.389
You stay here.

00:38:58.098 --> 00:38:59.324
Huh?

00:38:59.349 --> 00:39:01.476
My hair, oh my god.

00:39:01.476 --> 00:39:02.535
Yanna.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.229
Stop crying.

00:39:04.813 --> 00:39:06.815
Don’t mind them anymore.

00:39:09.359 --> 00:39:11.319
You did great. Okay?

00:39:15.654 --> 00:39:18.032
You were amazing.
Don’t mind them anymore.

00:39:18.057 --> 00:39:20.643
I knew I’d find you here.

00:39:22.622 --> 00:39:23.957
And now there’s another one.

00:39:24.249 --> 00:39:26.001
Just leave me alone!

00:39:26.376 --> 00:39:28.753
No way. You can
cry all you want.

00:39:28.912 --> 00:39:30.956
You don’t have to hide it
from us anymore.

00:39:31.423 --> 00:39:33.133
Go away.

00:39:33.133 --> 00:39:34.134
No.

00:39:34.134 --> 00:39:35.552
We’re not leaving.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:41.570
We’re not leaving you alone
until we’re sure you’re okay.

00:39:44.519 --> 00:39:45.937
I’m fine.

00:39:45.937 --> 00:39:47.564
Yeah, sure. You’re fine.

00:39:47.564 --> 00:39:48.940
You’re totally fine. Okay.

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:49.899
Via?

00:39:51.067 --> 00:39:52.189
Via.

00:39:53.111 --> 00:39:54.279
Damn it.

00:39:54.988 --> 00:39:56.323
You’re all crazy.

00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.009
Well? Do you want us
to go beat her ass?

00:40:00.034 --> 00:40:01.703
Do you want me to beat your ass?

00:40:03.121 --> 00:40:04.289
You’re insane.

00:40:04.914 --> 00:40:05.915
Arkin?

00:40:06.833 --> 00:40:07.834
Where are you?

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:15.508
Damn it! Who else is coming, huh?

00:40:15.675 --> 00:40:17.010
I just followed Arkin.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:18.970
Pres asked me to look for Sam.

00:40:20.347 --> 00:40:21.848
Sevi, where is she?

00:40:22.432 --> 00:40:23.975
I swear I’m gonna punch her.

00:40:23.975 --> 00:40:25.352
Keep your voice down,
we’re in the library.

00:40:25.352 --> 00:40:26.311
Hey…

00:40:26.311 --> 00:40:27.645
Stop crying!

00:40:29.105 --> 00:40:30.899
We all hate her, don’t worry.

00:40:32.067 --> 00:40:33.735
- Take my jacket—
- So childish.

00:40:33.735 --> 00:40:34.824
Use it for now.

00:40:35.653 --> 00:40:36.863
It doesn’t stink, okay?

00:40:37.572 --> 00:40:39.407
Your makeup’s all ruined now.

00:40:41.409 --> 00:40:44.245
Yanna, don’t ever think there’s
something wrong with you, okay?

00:40:44.245 --> 00:40:45.288
You didn’t do anything wrong.

00:40:45.288 --> 00:40:48.917
You didn’t do anything bad.

00:40:48.917 --> 00:40:50.835
Right. That’s true.

00:40:50.835 --> 00:40:54.297
And they’re just jealous because
you did great at the pageant earlier.

00:40:54.297 --> 00:40:55.245
Yeah!

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:56.383
When people get jealous,

00:40:56.383 --> 00:40:59.969
they want to intimidate you
and tear your confidence down.

00:40:59.969 --> 00:41:02.347
Don’t let them get to you. Huh?

00:41:03.139 --> 00:41:05.183
Of course not!

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:08.353
That’s the spirit!
You fight back, don’t give up!

00:41:08.353 --> 00:41:09.354
He’s right!

00:41:09.354 --> 00:41:10.647
Right?

00:41:10.647 --> 00:41:13.274
How about we grab
food after this?

00:41:13.274 --> 00:41:15.568
That’s even better!
Sam’s treating us!

00:41:15.568 --> 00:41:16.861
That’s right. Sam’s paying.

00:41:16.861 --> 00:41:18.363
- Sam’s gonna treat us!
- Go, Sam.

00:41:18.363 --> 00:41:20.073
- Me?
- Yes!

00:41:20.073 --> 00:41:20.865
Okay!

00:41:20.865 --> 00:41:22.117
Yeah, I’m hungry too.

00:41:22.117 --> 00:41:22.951
Let’s go?

00:41:22.951 --> 00:41:24.285
- Let’s go.
- Later, okay?

00:41:24.285 --> 00:41:25.495
Later, after the pageant.

00:41:25.495 --> 00:41:26.663
All right. As long as it’s free.

00:41:26.663 --> 00:41:27.872
Yeah, after the pageant.

00:41:27.872 --> 00:41:29.749
- After the pageant.
- Let’s go.

00:41:30.875 --> 00:41:32.377
Let’s go, guys!

00:41:32.377 --> 00:41:33.336
Let’s go.

00:41:33.336 --> 00:41:34.337
The water—

00:41:35.713 --> 00:41:36.714
Let’s go.

00:41:40.116 --> 00:41:41.117
Be careful.

00:41:41.803 --> 00:41:43.304
So tall!

00:41:43.304 --> 00:41:44.764
Wow. Okay.

00:41:45.347 --> 00:41:46.188
Okay.

00:41:46.213 --> 00:41:48.591
There. So pretty. Let’s go!

00:41:55.481 --> 00:41:58.901
And our Miss Valerian
of the year is…

00:42:05.994 --> 00:42:08.788
Our first year representative—

00:42:08.788 --> 00:42:10.874
- Helena Hernandez!
- Helena Hernandez!

00:42:23.595 --> 00:42:25.263
I hope she’s okay though.

00:42:30.878 --> 00:42:32.296
She looks fine.

00:42:43.117 --> 00:42:44.574
Stay tuned, guys.

00:42:44.574 --> 00:42:48.578
Don’t go home yet because the
music club will be playing later.

00:42:48.578 --> 00:42:50.246
Can’t wait for them
to serenade us.

00:42:51.498 --> 00:42:54.250
Congratulations.

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:57.378
Finally, it’s over.

00:42:58.671 --> 00:42:59.797
Are you okay?

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:02.842
You did well, Yanna.

00:43:04.344 --> 00:43:05.595
Thanks.

00:43:05.595 --> 00:43:08.014
You guys even fought for me.

00:43:08.848 --> 00:43:09.849
Of course.

00:43:09.849 --> 00:43:11.476
- For you.
- But I’m never gonna do this again.

00:43:11.476 --> 00:43:13.061
My feet hurt so much.

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:18.233
It’s okay, Yanna.

00:43:18.858 --> 00:43:20.360
You still have a chance
to join next year.

00:43:21.653 --> 00:43:24.239
No way! It’s such a hassle.

00:43:26.032 --> 00:43:27.784
Hey! Don’t leave yet, okay?

00:43:27.784 --> 00:43:29.118
I’m going to sing. Watch me.

00:43:30.662 --> 00:43:32.664
- Okay.
- Sure thing!

00:43:32.664 --> 00:43:34.165
Let’s support Arkin, guys.

00:43:34.457 --> 00:43:36.459
You all have to come watch him,

00:43:36.484 --> 00:43:37.944
because he just
might cry if you don’t.

00:43:38.836 --> 00:43:41.047
I will cry, Via,
if you don’t watch!

00:43:41.923 --> 00:43:44.342
Do your best, okay?
Don’t be nervous.

00:43:44.342 --> 00:43:46.344
If you start to feel nervous,
just look for me in the audience.

00:43:46.344 --> 00:43:50.932
Look at me and think that
it’s just like we’re practicing.

00:43:50.932 --> 00:43:51.516
All right then.

00:43:51.516 --> 00:43:55.234
I’ll just think that
I’m singing for you.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.481
By the way!

00:43:58.481 --> 00:44:01.025
Let’s eat first. Ke’s already
waiting over there.

00:44:01.025 --> 00:44:02.026
- Let’s go!
- Come on.

00:44:02.026 --> 00:44:02.735
It’s my treat!

00:44:02.735 --> 00:44:03.736
Let’s go.

00:44:03.736 --> 00:44:04.862
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

00:44:04.862 --> 00:44:06.281
- I’ll go change first.
- It’s Sam’s treat, after all!

00:44:06.281 --> 00:44:08.616
- Poor you.
- Yeah, go ahead.

00:44:09.217 --> 00:44:10.927
Thanks for the treat, Sam!

00:44:10.952 --> 00:44:12.620
Thanks, Sam!
You’re really so nice.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:13.621
You’re the best, Sam.

00:44:13.621 --> 00:44:14.747
Hope we can do this again soon.

00:44:14.747 --> 00:44:15.821
You’re all so loud.

00:44:15.846 --> 00:44:17.973
I'm just gonna grab a drink,
I’m choking here.

00:44:18.835 --> 00:44:19.919
This is my spot.

00:44:19.919 --> 00:44:21.170
You’re too much, dude.

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:23.214
You know what guys,
for some reason,

00:44:23.214 --> 00:44:24.882
I wanna be friends with Yanna.

00:44:25.454 --> 00:44:27.474
I think she’s a good person.

00:44:28.428 --> 00:44:31.931
But, I’m not really
good at making friends.

00:44:33.099 --> 00:44:34.100
But don’t you have
lots of friends?

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:35.435
You talk to a lot
of people at school.

00:44:35.435 --> 00:44:36.455
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.856
Doesn’t that mean
they’re your friends?

00:44:38.717 --> 00:44:39.789
Not really.

00:44:39.814 --> 00:44:41.983
For me, I only consider
someone my friend

00:44:41.983 --> 00:44:44.235
if I’ve shared something
with that person.

00:44:44.235 --> 00:44:46.613
Whether it’s my time or
you know, a secret.

00:44:48.669 --> 00:44:49.795
Just like us, Via.

00:44:52.744 --> 00:44:55.079
Us? Are you guys a couple?

00:44:55.538 --> 00:44:56.623
Best friends.

00:44:57.226 --> 00:44:58.184
No.

00:44:58.209 --> 00:45:00.336
- Childhood best friends.
- …hood best friends.

00:45:00.361 --> 00:45:01.695
I thought you two were dating.

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.556
Don’t worry, we thought so too.

00:45:04.255 --> 00:45:06.341
By the way, we’ll be having
parlor games this week.

00:45:06.341 --> 00:45:08.384
I’m signing you guys up,
no backing out.

00:45:08.384 --> 00:45:09.218
Arkin.

00:45:09.218 --> 00:45:10.887
- I’ll put you in the—
- Yeah, Arkin should join.

00:45:10.887 --> 00:45:15.224
the three-legged race
and the tug of war.

00:45:15.224 --> 00:45:17.352
I don’t want to.
Those are for kids. Pass.

00:45:17.352 --> 00:45:18.936
Then I’ll just put Via’s
name down instead.

00:45:18.936 --> 00:45:20.104
No, I’ll do it.

00:45:20.104 --> 00:45:21.856
What was it again?
Three-legged race—

00:45:21.856 --> 00:45:23.316
- tug of war.
- And tug of war. Yeah.

00:45:23.316 --> 00:45:29.040
Then I’ll put Kierra and Via
in the pass-the-paper game.

00:45:29.065 --> 00:45:30.024
You joining, Sevi?

00:45:30.049 --> 00:45:31.759
Yeah, I like that game!

00:45:32.533 --> 00:45:34.118
Pass the paper’s fun.

00:45:34.243 --> 00:45:35.620
I know what Sevi likes.

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:38.623
Then I’ll put Sam
in the bring-me game.

00:45:38.623 --> 00:45:41.042
What about Yanna,
is she joining too?

00:45:49.078 --> 00:45:51.581
All right, perfect,
we’ve got our team!

00:45:57.194 --> 00:45:58.946
Can I get another hotdog, Sam?

00:45:59.519 --> 00:46:00.520
Go ahead, get more.

00:46:01.479 --> 00:46:03.606
Grab more, there’s plenty.

00:46:04.315 --> 00:46:05.316
Here you go.

00:46:09.567 --> 00:46:10.985
Mic test, mic test—

00:46:11.489 --> 00:46:13.449
Hi, we’re the Music Club.

00:46:13.449 --> 00:46:16.922
I’m Arkin, I play guitar
and do vocals.

00:46:16.947 --> 00:46:21.076
This is Zild on bass,
Rafael on electric,

00:46:21.249 --> 00:46:24.252
and Gelo on drums.

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.410
We hope you enjoy
our performance.

00:46:33.136 --> 00:46:35.012
Larkin Sanchez is so handsome!

00:46:35.012 --> 00:46:37.598
You wouldn’t think he’s
a student here, right?

00:46:37.598 --> 00:46:38.474
He looks like a celebrity.

00:48:01.133 --> 00:48:02.183
Looks like he did really well.

00:48:02.183 --> 00:48:04.268
Maybe you’ll even
join his fan club later.

00:48:04.994 --> 00:48:08.039
I’ve always known
he’s good. Always have.

00:48:08.064 --> 00:48:14.987
♪ Take me into your radiant world. ♪

00:48:18.032 --> 00:48:24.956
♪ Take me into your radiant world. ♪

00:48:27.083 --> 00:48:29.794
Let’s go! Arkin!

00:48:30.461 --> 00:48:32.880
- Music club!
- Yeah! Good job!

00:48:37.051 --> 00:48:38.469
Is that okay now?

00:48:38.469 --> 00:48:40.805
Guys, I checked
the booths earlier.

00:48:40.805 --> 00:48:42.360
Everything’s set up nicely,

00:48:42.385 --> 00:48:45.250
and the Dedication and Marriage
booths look really cute.

00:48:45.275 --> 00:48:46.234
Nice.

00:48:46.259 --> 00:48:47.803
Right. Even the, you know,
the Jail booth,

00:48:47.828 --> 00:48:49.095
you can see
the effort there too.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.957
Also the horror one,
let’s go there later.

00:48:51.983 --> 00:48:55.111
And invite Yanna, her body
needs a little scare.

00:48:55.111 --> 00:48:56.946
You always tease Yanna.

00:48:56.946 --> 00:49:01.450
By the way, if anyone wants to
sign up for the marriage booth,

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:03.703
if you’re planning
to get married—

00:49:03.703 --> 00:49:05.079
You can give your names to me,

00:49:05.079 --> 00:49:06.205
I’m the one keeping the list.

00:49:06.205 --> 00:49:07.790
And for those
of you with partners,

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:10.751
maybe you want
to marry them too.

00:49:10.751 --> 00:49:13.254
You never know, they might
change their mind later, right?

00:49:13.477 --> 00:49:14.522
True.

00:49:14.547 --> 00:49:15.961
What if there’s no partner?

00:49:16.257 --> 00:49:17.469
Don’t you have a crush?

00:49:18.009 --> 00:49:20.136
If you do,
I’ll even help you out.

00:49:20.136 --> 00:49:22.813
Come on, let’s handcuff them,
they might try to escape.

00:49:22.838 --> 00:49:23.865
Escape?

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:25.533
What’s that supposed to mean?

00:49:25.558 --> 00:49:26.851
There’s no getting away now.

00:49:26.851 --> 00:49:28.853
I might get punched though.

00:49:28.853 --> 00:49:31.230
I’ll fight them. You see this?
Can you see it?

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:33.482
I can fight. See this?

00:49:33.482 --> 00:49:35.776
Excuse me, can I sign up?

00:49:36.152 --> 00:49:37.153
Huh?

00:49:37.403 --> 00:49:39.655
You have someone
you want to marry, Arkin?

00:49:39.655 --> 00:49:41.741
Oh wow, who is it?

00:49:41.741 --> 00:49:44.035
Hey! Are you keeping
a secret from us?

00:49:46.743 --> 00:49:48.055
Let’s list them down already.

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.040
Here, a pen.

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.167
- So, what are the names?
- Give it to me, I’ll write it down. Hurry.

00:49:51.167 --> 00:49:52.460
- Go, come on.
- How many?

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:53.419
Sorry, it should only be one.

00:49:53.419 --> 00:49:54.420
Tell us.

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:55.296
It’s... it’s...

00:49:55.296 --> 00:49:56.297
- Who?
- Who?

00:49:56.297 --> 00:49:57.648
- And what time?
- Hurry up.

00:49:57.673 --> 00:49:59.425
- Sam!
- Yeah?

00:49:59.425 --> 00:50:00.384
Can you come here, they
have issues with the games.

00:50:00.384 --> 00:50:01.761
Okay.
Hold on.

00:50:01.761 --> 00:50:02.887
We’ll be back.

00:50:03.039 --> 00:50:04.055
Yes?

00:50:04.055 --> 00:50:05.514
- What is this about?
- What’s up?

00:50:08.893 --> 00:50:09.894
Via.

00:50:10.144 --> 00:50:11.145
Huh?

00:50:13.814 --> 00:50:15.024
Let’s get married.

00:51:06.836 --> 00:51:07.868
I’m just going backstage
for a bit, okay?

00:51:07.868 --> 00:51:08.938
All right, go ahead.

00:51:11.247 --> 00:51:12.581
Ma’am, excuse me.

00:51:12.581 --> 00:51:14.166
- Yes, ma’am?
- Can I order some water?

00:51:14.166 --> 00:51:15.543
Sure! I’ll get some for you.

00:51:15.543 --> 00:51:16.877
Do you need anything else?

00:51:42.186 --> 00:51:43.771
Have you had your
first kiss yet, Via?

00:51:46.417 --> 00:51:47.751
What if you become
my first kiss?

00:51:49.869 --> 00:51:50.870
Me?

00:51:51.412 --> 00:51:52.663
Have you been here long?

00:51:52.688 --> 00:51:53.812
Yeah.

00:51:53.985 --> 00:51:56.445
Volleyball practice ended a bit late.

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:58.389
Come on, I’ll walk you
to the terminal.

00:51:58.414 --> 00:52:02.668
Kino, I think I have
a crush on someone.

00:52:02.798 --> 00:52:05.051
Who? Who’s your crush?

00:52:05.051 --> 00:52:06.010
It’s Pres.

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:10.473
Maybe it’s better if we don’t
hang out too much at school.

00:52:10.473 --> 00:52:11.265
Huh?

00:52:11.265 --> 00:52:14.101
People might think
I’m your boyfriend.

00:52:14.101 --> 00:52:16.929
It would be a shame if you didn’t
get a chance with your crush.

00:52:18.981 --> 00:52:19.982
Huh?

00:52:26.697 --> 00:52:27.865
Pres, you want some?

00:52:30.242 --> 00:52:31.243
Sure.
