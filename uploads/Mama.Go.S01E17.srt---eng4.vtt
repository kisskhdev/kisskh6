00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.240
Two years passed peacefully

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.759
I almost forgot

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:41.479
that I

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.200
am going to die

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:47.840
It's been two years

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.359
and I still can't

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.200
face death calmly

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.560
Wildflowers gradually withering

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:01.840
Decaying fallen leaves

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:10.079
Kittens born to stray cats

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.480
Empty bottles after finishing drinks

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.439
all constantly remind me that time is limited

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.319
Death

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:22.400
follows me like a shadow

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:37.959
Darn it

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.680
You're so close with A Fu now

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.560
ask him for me

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.760
how much longer I have to live

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.120
The students are waiting for me

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.079
Okay, okay

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:49.680
Then... then you...

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.000
at least ask him how I'll die, okay?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.560
Will it be an accident or an illness?

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.840
Will it hurt? I'm mentally prepared

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.599
I'm afraid of pain

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.920
It's not like I haven't asked

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:59.280
Come on, you've been anxious for two years

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.040
I'm actually glad their lips are sealed

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.959
and they didn't tell you

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.359
If you actually found out

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.439
imagine how bandaged your hands would be

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.599
It hurts, hurts! Scared! Scared of pain!

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.159
It hurts, it hurts

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.800
Ever since Xu Rui became

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.680
a potential client for Life Energy Exchange

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.719
she has A Fu wrapped around her finger

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.240
Xu Rui's intelligence and wit

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.960
completely impressed the alien

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.719
Not only is A Fu at her beck and call

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.560
he even wants to invite her as a special consultant

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.680
Let me tell you the holidays first

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.360
Spring Festival, New Year's Day

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.560
Labor Day, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.240
Birthdays, National Day

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.479
Double 11, Double 12

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.840
Double 12

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.520
Birthdays are half price

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:37.159
Half price

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.960
Double 11 is 110 percent

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.560
110 percent

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:42.240
Ten... ten... isn't 110 percent more expensive?

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.520
1.1 percent

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.240
Double 12 is 1.2 percent

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.439
And for other holidays

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.639
everything is half price

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.199
Everything is half price

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.639
Did you get that?

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.599
So that's how it works

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.639
Got it, got it

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.479
As for my mom

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.039
What are you two doing?

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.039
Fang'er, why are you waking up just now?

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:09.000
Look what time it is

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.159
The breakfast I brought you is cold

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:12.039
Xiaoyin

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:13.879
Let me have a sip of your coffee

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.280
This is an Iced Americano

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.080
Can you drink it on an empty stomach?

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.919
No problem

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:20.520
Fang'er

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.280
You don't act like a mom at all anymore

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:26.599
Where are you two going?

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.719
Xi and I need to rent a small warehouse for our online shop

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.319
We can't keep piling stuff in the dorm

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.159
The owner is only free in the morning

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.319
Where is the warehouse?

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.919
Seagull Street

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:35.479
That's a bit far

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.639
There's Professor Wang Mei's class at ten o'clock

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:38.439
Can you make it back in time?

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.560
It's fine, the teachers will understand

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.360
Teachers can't stop us

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.319
from finding our own path

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.039
Where's Zhuyun?

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.319
Last night she said that for her grad school English exam

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.879
she got several cloze test questions wrong

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.520
She was depressed all night

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:54.479
Her boyfriend said

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.080
"It's okay"

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.360
"If you don't pass, let's not take it"

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.919
"I'll support you"

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.599
And then?

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.120
Then that scared her so much that at 5:30 this morning

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:01.960
she ran to the study room to do practice problems

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:04.120
We're leaving

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.639
Bye

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:04.960
Okay

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.960
Bye-bye, Guifang

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.520
Bye-bye, Fang'er

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.360
If you don't become a grad student, you'll have to research childbirth

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.480
Ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.879
Quick, quick, quick! Run!

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.920
Okay.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.639
Speed up.

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:47.079
The thing is, I really never expected...

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.399
That I, Kong Xiaocan...

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.040
Would actually become a Demolition heir in my lifetime.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.399
Move out within 120 days of receiving payment.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.199
Demolition heir, let's find a place.

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:57.600
Wait, why aren't you going?

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.120
Well, I have a very unexpected injury right now.

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:03.800
I'm in extremely poor health.

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:05.199
Hello? Mom?

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:11.160
Good Mom. You're really something.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.680
No one cares about me.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.800
I'm just a little weed.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.439
Stinky weed.

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:19.279
Take five, everyone.

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:20.879
Drink some water if you need to.

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:32.639
I unscrewed it for you.

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:38.399
See? I'm pretty good at caring for people, right?

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.759
But no one cares about me.

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:42.480
Especially my mom.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.279
Seriously.

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:44.399
She's never home.

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:46.319
She's probably already forgotten...

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:47.160
Her identity as a mother.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.000
The attitude she has when talking to me...

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.480
My fridge at home...

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.079
That ice hasn't been scraped in three years.

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:52.279
It's as thick as a heel.

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:53.000
It's not my fault.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Because it's gotten so thick...

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.199
You can't fit groceries in anymore.

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:56.000
So I have to order takeout.

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:57.399
And with food safety issues these days...

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.879
What if I die from food poisoning?

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.600
Don't you think?

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:09.199
When you just go "Mmhmm," you're just humoring me.

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:10.079
You weren't listening, were you?

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:10.800
I was listening.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.560
What did I just say?

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:14.480
Heel.

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:18.519
That ice is really thick.

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:19.839
It's not that I'm paranoid.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.839
In my condition, and you not telling me the cause...

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:23.160
Scraping ice is also dangerous.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.800
There's difluoromethane in the fridge.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.000
If you nick the pipe even a little...

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.680
It could easily explode.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.439
What if I die from...

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.240
That's impossible.

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:31.839
And that frozen fish...

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:33.720
There's bacteria on frozen fish.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.959
If my hand gets infected by the bacteria...

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.279
Best case, amputation.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.680
Worst case, sepsis.

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:44.079
Really? This...

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.800
Is this it?

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:48.079
Look at your face.

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:50.519
Good thing it's not. Quick, knock on wood.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.399
Don't die of sepsis.

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:52.360
That's an ugly way to die.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.600
What are you doing?

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.079
Covering it like that...

00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:58.199
Trying to make the bacteria more comfortable?

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:01.920
Where's the wound?

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.639
It's...

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.560
The wound... where is it?

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:07.480
It migrated.

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:12.240
No, it healed.

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:17.759
Later...

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:19.279
Come with me somewhere.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.480
Me?

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:26.879
A Fu needs to see you.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:34.839
No,

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.240
what's it like up there?

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.439
The alien base must be really flashy.

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:41.199
Is it like when a door opens,

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:43.800
it's all white and floating like in the movies?

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.319
Are their true forms disgusting?

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:46.480
Do they look like that kind of...

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.680
You watch too many TV dramas, don't you?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
No, it's normal.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.120
You'll see once you go up.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.120
Xiaocan.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.439
Dear Can.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.199
Please come in.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.560
How is the situation here?

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.959
Did the esteemed Ms. Lin Xurui explain it to you?

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.000
It doesn't matter.

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:10.759
Allow me to explain it to you again.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.680
The esteemed and wise Ms. Lin Xurui

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.759
has already introduced to us

00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:17.279
the details regarding the Human Shopping Festival.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.360
I realized that in our project,

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:25.000
there is one thing missing the most.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.639
That is publicity.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.920
So, after a meeting decision,

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.440
we decided to hire you, Mr. Kong Xiaocan,

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.759
as the Life Energy Exchange plan's

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:42.919
spokesperson.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.600
Where'd he learn to talk like this?

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.480
Let me introduce to you...

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.399
Please allow me

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.840
to formally introduce my race to you two.

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:07.799
So you are...

00:09:09.039 --> 00:09:11.600
located less than five light-years from Earth

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.480
in Centaurus,

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:15.639
on the planet designated B2526.

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:17.240
That is our home planet.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.240
We are such advanced and elegant beings.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.440
But we possess a metabolic system

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.879
with an exceptionally low conversion rate.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.840
To live long,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.399
we must be slow, slow, slow.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.679
This has seriously impacted our planet's development.

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:38.440
Therefore, our Expeditionary Department

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:39.919
stepped out of B2526,

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.279
stepped out of Centaurus,

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:43.840
and ventured into the Milky Way and the vast universe,

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.440
seeking life energy that allows us to leap forward.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.200
The life energy on Earth,

00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:52.360
resilient, vigorous, and endless,

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:54.639
will bring to our planet's life energy development

00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:55.679
and even to

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:58.440
the entire universe's life energy trading system

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.120
a tremendous transformation.

00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:03.039
We will make good use of Earth's resources

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.159
to advance life on our planet.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.080
We will also promote the development of life energy trading,

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.159
from P to A to B to C,

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:12.159
to the innovation of Little Turtles.

00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:13.960
One small step for us,

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.559
one giant leap for B2526.

00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:19.039
We bring life energy back to our home planet,

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.279
and leave the lessons from wealth exchange

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:23.000
to the universe.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.720
So this is your true form.

00:10:30.559 --> 00:10:31.759
Then those ninjas,

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:33.480
Prime Ministers, and Immortals,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.120
and that Qigong school are all your people?

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.720
Those are just fans.

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:38.799
The Kingdom of Turtles.

00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:41.919
Can it understand me?

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:42.919
He can.

00:10:43.879 --> 00:10:44.639
He even spoke.

00:10:44.759 --> 00:10:45.159
What did he say?

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:48.879
He said Ms. Xu Rui is very beautiful.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.559
What about me?

00:10:52.159 --> 00:10:52.720
He said...

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.399
Okay, come on.

00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:55.200
Let's look at the next place.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.039
Okay, thanks, thanks.

00:10:57.159 --> 00:10:57.519
Over here.

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:03.480
This...

00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:04.840
This is that ninja, right?

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.879
This is the statue of our planet's ruler,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.039
the Green King.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.159
So green.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.039
And over here is the office area.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.279
Are these all Turtle People?

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.039
How could these be Turtle People?

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.240
Look at the people here.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.399
Slacking off,

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:20.639
playing on their phones,

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:21.559
zoning out.

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:23.159
These are things only you humans do.

00:11:23.159 --> 00:11:25.039
True. No wonder they don't look like turtles.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:25.679
Except for you.

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:28.679
So they work for you?

00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:30.639
They are just ordinary people.

00:11:31.159 --> 00:11:33.279
This is just an ordinary agricultural company.

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:34.559
Do they know about you?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.799
No, they don't.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.600
Only the Expeditionary Department over there are our people.

00:11:40.279 --> 00:11:41.360
Hidden in plain sight.

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:46.440
The partners in the Expeditionary Department heard you were coming,

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.399
and they were thrilled.

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:48.559
They really admire you.

00:11:48.559 --> 00:11:49.480
They all want your autograph.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.200
I stopped them.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.600
Then I... I'll leave a bit later.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.120
You go up first.

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:53.399
Hold them off.

00:11:53.759 --> 00:11:54.399
Don't worry.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.480
To be a spokesperson,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.480
you just take a few photos

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.639
and say a few simple words.

00:11:57.639 --> 00:11:58.039
Over here.

00:12:10.879 --> 00:12:11.559
What does this mean?

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:13.159
Face scan.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.080
You two.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.799
These are the citizens of our planet.

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:51.440
Look at how lifeless they are.

00:12:52.039 --> 00:12:53.000
But before this,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.039
they were full of life and vitality.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.320
It's all because of that demon boss

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:01.759
and the new KPI policy he introduced.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:03.960
In the past,

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:06.120
we could use plant and animal energy to fill the quota.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.360
But now,

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.519
we can only obtain energy from humans.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.360
Kong Xiaocan,

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:15.840
not every human is like you,

00:13:16.159 --> 00:13:17.240
willing to agree to the trade.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.799
But your appearance

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:21.399
has reignited our hope

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:22.840
of obtaining energy.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.159
Friends,

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:25.159
this

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:27.320
is the one I told you about,

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.519
our spokesperson, Kong Xiaocan.

00:13:29.759 --> 00:13:30.480
Kong Xiaocan!

00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:32.080
He's finally here!

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:33.080
Kong Xiaocan!

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:33.559
What are you doing?

00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:34.360
What does this mean?

00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:36.000
What is it? What's going on?

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.519
What? What do you mean?

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.120
What is this?

00:13:39.879 --> 00:13:40.559
Help us!

00:13:40.919 --> 00:13:41.639
Please help us!

00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:42.480
Help us!

00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:43.600
Help us!

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.000
Please help us, Kong Xiaocan!

00:13:45.919 --> 00:13:47.519
You are a successful case study.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.279
Through you, we will return to the negotiating table.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.639
Through you,

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.159
we might be able to

00:13:54.159 --> 00:13:55.039
obtain new energy from humans.

00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:57.720
Are you willing to give us a hand?

00:13:58.399 --> 00:13:58.840
I...

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:03.480
What does that mean?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.679
It means that

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.279
the clients who trade with you

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.799
will all know of Kong Xiaocan's existence.

00:14:07.919 --> 00:14:08.840
We will be careful.

00:14:08.919 --> 00:14:10.200
We will protect his safety.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:10.559
No way.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.720
Kong Guifang still doesn't know

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.480
that Kong Xiaocan traded life energy for her.

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:15.679
What if she finds out?

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.519
We will sign a Confidentiality Agreement

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:18.960
with every single client.

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:20.240
Don't worry.

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:21.120
Rest assured.

00:14:21.399 --> 00:14:23.000
Fellow Turtle friends,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.559
Turtle besties,

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:25.960
I'm late.

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:28.799
But with me here,

00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:30.720
you can just relax.

00:14:30.879 --> 00:14:32.480
And together, what do we do?

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:34.320
Just put... put your hearts at ease.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:35.799
Anything else...

00:14:36.679 --> 00:14:37.279
Did you hear that?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.639
Did you hear that?

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:39.559
We heard it!

00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:42.919
This is the guarantee from our spokesperson, Kong Xiaocan!

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.360
Kong Xiaocan!

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:50.879
Kong Xiaocan! Kong Xiaocan! Kong Xiaocan!

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.960
Kong Xiaocan!

00:14:52.039 --> 00:14:59.840
Kong Xiaocan! Kong Xiaocan! Kong Xiaocan!

00:14:59.919 --> 00:15:00.759
Kong Xiaocan!

00:15:00.919 --> 00:15:01.840
Kong Xiaocan!

00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:04.200
Hello, is that Kong Guifang?

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:04.679
Yes.

00:15:04.679 --> 00:15:06.879
I'm Professor Wang Mei's assistant from Duxing University.

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:07.799
At 2:00 PM today,

00:15:07.799 --> 00:15:09.480
we have an appointment with President Ma to discuss seed procurement.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.759
Please follow me this way.

00:15:10.759 --> 00:15:11.240
Okay.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:15.559
This way.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:17.799
That's great.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.639
Xiaocan,

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.799
how about in a while,

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.320
we organize a sharing session for you?

00:15:24.519 --> 00:15:26.039
You can pass on your advanced experience

00:15:26.039 --> 00:15:28.360
to all our frontline staff,

00:15:28.759 --> 00:15:30.159
so they can learn from it.

00:15:32.559 --> 00:15:33.320
We'll also shoot a set

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:35.120
of simple portraits for promotional materials.

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:36.000
As for the specific time,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.919
we'll decide later.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.039
See you two next time.

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:45.159
How much longer can I live?

00:15:45.159 --> 00:15:46.320
No comment.

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:52.919
President Ma, your guest has arrived.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.159
President Ma, hello.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.080
Hello, hello.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.039
Please, have a seat.

00:15:59.679 --> 00:16:02.279
I'm so happy to meet you today.

00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:03.279
Please sit, please sit.

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:04.440
I am also very honored.

00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:06.679
President Ma, I came today...

00:16:06.679 --> 00:16:07.279
This...

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:09.279
is to... let me introduce our company.

00:16:09.799 --> 00:16:11.320
Our Wanxiang Denong Company...

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.960
was established in 1988.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.159
Covering the three main staples: wheat, corn, and rice,

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.639
as well as soybeans, rapeseed,

00:16:17.919 --> 00:16:20.720
sorghum, potatoes, and other crop seed industries.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.840
After more than forty years of development,

00:16:23.679 --> 00:16:25.720
we have opened twenty-six branches.

00:16:26.159 --> 00:16:28.519
The number of employees exceeds 9,700.

00:16:29.039 --> 00:16:32.039
We are a supplier for the entire modern agricultural industry chain.

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:34.639
Providing high-quality and safe agricultural products.

00:16:34.919 --> 00:16:35.679
Please take a look.

00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:39.159
President Ma, that's about enough.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.720
This is our financial report.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.320
Total revenue for the first quarter.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.679
The first quarter of this year...

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.720
our revenue...

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.240
increased by 15.24% year-on-year.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.120
Approximately...

00:16:49.159 --> 00:16:51.279
85,440,800 RMB.

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:53.879
Gross margin is 32.69%.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.360
Net profit margin is 44.94%.

00:16:56.799 --> 00:16:58.879
You could say the future is bright.

00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:01.320
Really impressive.

00:17:01.799 --> 00:17:02.480
President Ma, I came to...

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.319
So I think you fit...

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:05.519
our company's temperament very well.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.680
Our company really needs talent like you.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.839
And our benefits are also very high.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.480
Are you willing to come to our company for an internship?

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.839
How high?

00:17:17.519 --> 00:17:18.000
Super high.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:20.079
Really, really high.

00:17:31.519 --> 00:17:34.160
On the afternoon of the 727th day of my relationship

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.519
with the beautiful and smart student Chen Xiaoyin,

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.039
I wonder if I am lucky enough to receive

00:17:39.119 --> 00:17:40.039
my goddess,

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.599
student Chen Xiaoyin's,

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.839
blessing for a successful interview?

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.119
If I don't pass this time,

00:17:51.359 --> 00:17:52.880
I'll come back to get beaten and kneel on a washboard.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.519
If it's like this,

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:14.920
doesn't that mean

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.440
I'm going to be famous in the Life Energy trading world?

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.960
Think about it the other way, A Fu is begging you.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.920
Maybe there are benefits.

00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:23.160
No, no, no, I don't need any benefits.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.759
I just want to know when I'll die.

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:26.319
Are you annoying or what?

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.079
You're so wishy-washy.

00:18:27.079 --> 00:18:28.200
Believe it or not, I'll make you die right now.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.599
What are you two doing here?

00:18:31.599 --> 00:18:32.480
Contemplating life?

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:33.480
You...

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.799
Come chase me, Xiaocan. Come on.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.480
Come on, come on, come on.

00:18:39.559 --> 00:18:40.160
Are you sick?

00:18:40.759 --> 00:18:41.680
Do you know that excessive fright

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.839
can cause heart... my sudden death?

00:18:42.839 --> 00:18:43.880
What's my situation now?

00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:45.359
Learning to think about death is a good thing.

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:47.119
Buddy, you have the potential to study philosophy.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.000
Why are you dressed like that?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:49.640
Rushing to get a divorce?

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.119
Flesh and blood bodies are just prone to dying.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.759
But philosophy is dead.

00:18:57.519 --> 00:18:59.039
Albert Einstein.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.880
A guy who published in two journals during college,

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.680
and self-taught German to C1 level,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.960
actually can't find a job paying 4,000 a month.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:07.599
Serves you right.

00:19:08.079 --> 00:19:10.240
You two just stay here and study philosophy properly.

00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:12.000
I, who have an internship position,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.720
am going to work.

00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:14.960
Bye-bye.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.759
Remember to eat.

00:19:20.279 --> 00:19:21.480
Is she trying to break my heart?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Does she stab you like that too?

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.079
Every single day.

00:19:24.319 --> 00:19:25.359
You'll grow up once you're numb to it.

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:27.279
A-Tian.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.440
Li Wai, Xiaocan.

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:29.319
Have you eaten?

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.640
Which meal are you talking about?

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.000
Go on, get back to work.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
I'm going for a run then.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.440
Still so bad at making conversation.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.759
Stop sighing. That's so out of style.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:40.799
Give me a break.

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:42.079
Look at this. So handsome.

00:19:42.279 --> 00:19:42.920
Even Xiao Xin...

00:19:43.079 --> 00:19:44.359
...has two more abs than he does.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.079
Looks like our Xiao Tian is officially a has-been.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.720
The world is so fickle.

00:19:50.599 --> 00:19:52.200
Ever since he and that shady agent...

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.119
...terminated their contract...

00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:54.000
...why does he seem like he's...

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.559
...living in a sports drink commercial all day?

00:19:56.759 --> 00:19:57.440
So what?

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.279
He lost the right to live next door to you.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.640
And the perk of mooching meals off us.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.880
He doesn't have a girlfriend who breaks his heart.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.119
Or a girlfriend who hits people.

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:04.880
And he doesn't have a best buddy...

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.039
...who tolerates his high-maintenance drama.

00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:06.759
Most importantly...

00:20:06.759 --> 00:20:08.759
...he isn't a selfless, devoted son.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.640
But he surely doesn't need a job that pays four thousand.

00:20:14.519 --> 00:20:14.880
Hang in there.

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:16.119
I'm off.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.880
These two plates of potatoes in front of me...

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.200
...might be something some of you haven't heard of...

00:20:22.319 --> 00:20:24.400
...or maybe haven't even seen before.

00:20:24.519 --> 00:20:26.240
These are red-fleshed potatoes.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.960
And this loquat I'm introducing next...

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.920
...is a variety I personally love.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.480
Watermelon is the ultimate heat-buster...

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.640
...and the portion is very generous.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.640
The color is incredibly vibrant.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.960
When it comes to food, what matters most?

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.079
The taste, right?

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:40.799
Thank you for the tip.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.119
Your contribution...

00:20:42.119 --> 00:20:43.680
...will help the loquat growers...

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.920
...in Niannian Township, Chengyun City...

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.559
...lift 55 farming households out of poverty.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.880
Thank you for supporting rural revitalization.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.599
So generous!

00:20:50.599 --> 00:20:51.480
Thank you, thank you all.

00:20:51.559 --> 00:20:53.000
It's all-natural and pollution-free.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.319
I've watched these grow since I was a kid.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.000
You all know I wouldn't lie to you.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.480
I want you to see their sincerity.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.160
I highly recommend this to you all.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.480
I hope you can show your support.

00:21:01.039 --> 00:21:01.519
Alright.

00:21:01.519 --> 00:21:02.519
Today's livestream...

00:21:02.519 --> 00:21:03.920
...is coming to an end.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.200
Thank you for your support.

00:21:05.359 --> 00:21:07.519
Thank you for contributing to rural revitalization.

00:21:07.759 --> 00:21:08.839
See you next time.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.519
Bye-bye.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.599
I'm heading out now.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.400
The dorm has an 11 o'clock curfew.

00:21:15.519 --> 00:21:16.119
Great work today.

00:21:16.319 --> 00:21:16.640
Good night.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.160
Xiao Wei, why not rent a place off-campus?

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.279
You're always rushing off after the stream.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.759
No thanks, living at school is fine for me.

00:21:23.119 --> 00:21:24.799
If I lived out, I'd lose my excuse to slip away early.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.240
I'm off.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:25.799
Okay.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.480
Xiao Wei is leaving.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.440
Bye, Sister Wang.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.079
Bye-bye.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:28.839
See you tomorrow, Xiao Wei.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.279
Bye Brother Wang, see you tomorrow.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:30.799
Okay.

00:23:12.119 --> 00:23:12.680
Sir, look.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.480
This huge living room.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.759
Connected to a big balcony. So bright.

00:23:16.519 --> 00:23:19.480
A big balcony needs to face the sun first, right?

00:23:19.839 --> 00:23:20.640
This faces north.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.880
Humans need sunlight.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:23.720
Photosynthesis.

00:23:23.839 --> 00:23:24.759
Just like an apple.

00:23:24.759 --> 00:23:25.799
If it doesn't get sun, it just...

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:26.640
Right?

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.599
Plus, it's easy to get depressed.

00:23:28.599 --> 00:23:29.440
Once depressed, he just...

00:23:30.599 --> 00:23:31.440
Good thing this is the second floor.

00:23:32.359 --> 00:23:32.839
Alright then.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.759
Let's check out the bathroom, okay?

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.799
Come, look how clean this bathroom is.

00:23:38.839 --> 00:23:41.920
This design of yours is quite interesting.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:42.640
Yes.

00:23:43.079 --> 00:23:45.000
But... do I shower while using the toilet?

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:45.759
Or use the toilet while showering?

00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:47.559
You need wet and dry separation.

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:49.240
I'll get soaked just using the toilet here.

00:23:49.759 --> 00:23:51.880
Most importantly, your pipes are aging.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.279
Look.

00:23:53.079 --> 00:23:54.200
What if this explodes?

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.200
Well then, come, let's look at the secondary bedroom.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:57.519
Okay.

00:23:58.559 --> 00:23:59.200
It's also quite comfortable.

00:23:59.839 --> 00:24:00.200
Seeing this,

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.720
I realize a more obvious problem.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.599
What problem?

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.440
This is the second floor.

00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:04.000
Yes.

00:24:04.119 --> 00:24:05.559
The second floor is easy for thieves and criminals to enter.

00:24:05.559 --> 00:24:07.160
That would be too dangerous.

00:24:07.319 --> 00:24:07.920
No, sir.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.240
There are guardrails here.

00:24:09.599 --> 00:24:10.640
What era is this?

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.359
These guardrails are just for show.

00:24:13.559 --> 00:24:14.279
No, sir.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.119
With your budget and the issues you just mentioned,

00:24:17.119 --> 00:24:18.880
I can only solve one at most.

00:24:20.359 --> 00:24:20.880
Pass?

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.079
Pass. Okay, no problem.

00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:24.480
I have more apartments here.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.359
I'll take you to see more.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.359
What do you say, Mom?

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.519
Mom.

00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:35.200
Still no good.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.240
This one has a balcony.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.680
North-south facing.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.559
Opposite this, facing that restaurant building.

00:24:40.559 --> 00:24:41.920
Is the Feng Shui bad?

00:24:42.799 --> 00:24:43.920
Do I even deserve to live here?

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.000
Are there listings across the street?

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.000
Yes.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.960
But across the street is high-end housing.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.319
To be honest,

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.319
Look, the price is indeed a bit high.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.599
Here, a two-bedroom is three thousand.

00:24:54.599 --> 00:24:55.400
And it has a big balcony.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.759
Over there, three thousand only gets you a single room.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.359
Same lake view,

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.279
Same greenery,

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.640
This side is still a better deal.

00:25:02.799 --> 00:25:03.480
Take me to have a look.

00:25:04.039 --> 00:25:04.559
Okay, sure, sure.

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:05.400
Wait, wait, wait.

00:25:05.599 --> 00:25:06.240
What are you doing?

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.960
Are you getting carried away?

00:25:08.119 --> 00:25:09.359
We should live within our means.

00:25:09.359 --> 00:25:10.480
How much money do we have?

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.319
We don't usually...

00:25:11.319 --> 00:25:12.440
We just need a place to live.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.920
The apartment is rented,

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.119
but life is our own.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.160
Fine, fine.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:16.839
Let's go look.

00:25:16.839 --> 00:25:18.119
That's right. Come, come, this way please.

00:25:18.119 --> 00:25:18.799
Keep up.

00:25:29.079 --> 00:25:30.559
I've looked at so many places.

00:25:31.359 --> 00:25:32.559
And I still think that one is the best.

00:25:32.839 --> 00:25:35.039
Both bedrooms face the sun.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.440
And open up the living room and kitchen completely.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.680
If you dare rent this place for 7,500 a month...

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.519
I... I'll run away from home immediately.

00:25:42.519 --> 00:25:43.240
I'm putting my foot down.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.559
Mom has it all planned out for you.

00:25:45.119 --> 00:25:45.839
That apartment...

00:25:45.839 --> 00:25:47.119
The full price is 3.6 million.

00:25:47.559 --> 00:25:49.640
I'll pay the down payment for you first.

00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:50.519
As for the monthly mortgage...

00:25:50.759 --> 00:25:51.160
Wait a minute.

00:25:52.039 --> 00:25:52.839
You want to buy it?

00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:53.440
Yeah.

00:25:57.319 --> 00:25:58.640
For most of my life...

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.480
I've had just two goals.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.559
One was putting you through college.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.559
The other was buying you a home for your marriage.

00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:05.920
That's about all I can do.

00:26:07.079 --> 00:26:08.880
Tell me, since I'm your mother...

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.839
I have to buy you a place, don't I?

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.960
It has to have at least two bedrooms.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.759
Whether you and Xu Rui have kids or not...

00:26:15.759 --> 00:26:16.599
That doesn't matter.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.519
I won't pressure you.

00:26:19.359 --> 00:26:20.720
I won't live with you anyway.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.319
Of the two rooms, one can be a study.

00:26:24.839 --> 00:26:26.119
When guests come, use it as a guest room.

00:26:26.559 --> 00:26:29.240
For example, if Li Wai and Xiaoyin have a fight...

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.759
You can take Li Wai in, right?

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.319
You can also get a puppy.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.359
A kitten works too.

00:26:36.839 --> 00:26:37.640
Cats are clean.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.519
They're easy to take care of.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.519
You've really planned it all out.

00:26:43.799 --> 00:26:44.559
What about yourself?

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.799
Living in the dorms?

00:26:46.039 --> 00:26:46.680
With Professor Wang?

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.359
Living on a subsidy of over a thousand a month?

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.160
Just tell me, why bother?

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.519
We finally have some money from the demolition.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.279
And now you're spending so much on a house.

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:55.599
Won't we become mortgage slaves again? You...

00:26:55.599 --> 00:26:56.119
No, no.

00:26:56.119 --> 00:26:56.680
I don't need that.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.440
Listen to me.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.519
Agronomy isn't that poor.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.720
I got my internship salary today.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.480
Guess how much.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.720
You get a salary?

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.200
How much?

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.599
Eighty? A hundred?

00:27:06.599 --> 00:27:07.440
A month.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.359
Thirteen thousand.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.359
How much?

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.440
Thirteen thousand!

00:27:14.599 --> 00:27:15.400
Thirteen thousand.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:15.880
Yeah.

00:27:16.359 --> 00:27:18.079
That's why I said I'd buy you a house.

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:19.599
I have money now.

00:27:21.839 --> 00:27:22.559
Don't doubt it.

00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:24.720
It's a big company, the prospects are great.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.079
The net profit margin is 44.94 percent.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.079
And the boss...

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.960
The boss doesn't look very...

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:30.720
Wait a minute. Alright, but...

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.960
This doesn't sound reliable at all.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.440
Li Wai is a legit graduate.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.440
And he can't even find a base salary of 4,000 now.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.680
You're an intern making thirteen thousand?

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.279
Do you think that's reasonable? Is it reliable?

00:27:38.599 --> 00:27:39.640
What company? Tell me the name.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.720
Mom, you've been scammed.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.519
I'm going to check it out for you.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.160
Wanxiang Denong.

00:27:43.519 --> 00:27:43.880
Wan...

00:27:46.359 --> 00:27:47.519
Guifang, we're off work now.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.720
Okay, bye-bye.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.200
Why is she working here?

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.519
She's a ticking time bomb!

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.599
I'm asking you. Is this your doing?

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.119
What intern makes thirteen thousand?

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.559
How could it be me?

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.039
I don't even work here.

00:28:15.559 --> 00:28:16.680
You don't work here?

00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:23.079
You're lying. You don't work here...

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:23.799
You *do* work here.

00:28:23.799 --> 00:28:24.680
How could you not know about her?

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.599
I don't have a desk job here.

00:28:26.599 --> 00:28:27.559
This has nothing to do with me.

00:28:27.559 --> 00:28:28.279
No matter what,

00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:29.200
get her out of here right now.

00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:31.279
How am I supposed to get her out?

00:28:31.559 --> 00:28:33.079
She... she knows me.

00:28:33.079 --> 00:28:33.680
Have you forgotten?

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:34.880
I'm that...

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.119
your dear son Kong Xiaocan...

00:28:37.119 --> 00:28:38.359
stole medicine from our lab...

00:28:38.359 --> 00:28:39.039
Alright, alright.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.400
...doctor.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.960
If you don't get her out of here,

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.160
I won't do the sharing session.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.440
Kong Xiaocan!

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.240
That sharing session counts towards my performance!

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.519
I'm begging you, okay?

00:28:57.519 --> 00:28:59.319
Get her out of here, fast.

00:28:59.319 --> 00:28:59.960
It's a deal.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.640
Why did he agree so quickly?

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.960
Was he manipulating my mind just now?

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.160
Humans are so smart.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.200
If anything is unclear, ask me anytime later.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.440
Xiaocan

00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:38.200
What are you doing here?

00:30:38.759 --> 00:30:39.799
Well, you... I...

00:30:39.799 --> 00:30:40.400
Wait a second.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.160
Why are you here?

00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:43.960
It's pouring rain.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.400
Isn't it only right for a son to pick up his mom?

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.279
No, no, no.

00:30:46.279 --> 00:30:47.519
You want something. What is it?

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.039
Mom, you're being a bit cynic...

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.279
It's still warm.

00:30:56.359 --> 00:30:56.920
Yeah.

00:31:00.759 --> 00:31:01.160
Mom.

00:31:02.279 --> 00:31:05.279
What have you been doing at the company lately?

00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:06.319
Working overtime so late every day.

00:31:06.839 --> 00:31:07.599
Making money.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.319
The overtime pay is really high.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.240
You haven't met any strange people lately, have you?

00:31:14.799 --> 00:31:15.640
Strange people?

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.680
Actually, yes.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:20.960
They're everywhere.

00:31:22.799 --> 00:31:24.319
No, I mean, they really are quite strange.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.279
A job with such a high salary,

00:31:26.279 --> 00:31:27.599
why doesn't anyone put their heart into it?

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.839
You're the weird one now, not them.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.079
I'm weird?

00:31:32.079 --> 00:31:34.519
Everyone's into "lying flat" these days, right?

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.279
Mom, look at you.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.599
You're twenty years old now.

00:31:38.599 --> 00:31:39.559
Working for someone else.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.720
By thirty, you'll just be a glorified employee.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.640
Wait, wait, wait.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.440
I've heard this speech before.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.279
I don't want to hear it a second time.

00:31:45.559 --> 00:31:46.559
The words are rough, but the logic holds.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.880
Isn't your life goal to plant saplings?

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.599
To do scientific research?

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.240
Why are you here just making money, Mom?

00:31:51.759 --> 00:31:53.920
As a lucky person who got a second chance at life,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:54.400
right?

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.200
Normally, people in your situation...

00:31:56.559 --> 00:31:58.839
At the very least, they'd go to college properly,

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.359
enjoy doing what they love.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.599
Or at best,

00:32:02.759 --> 00:32:04.400
take our demolition compensation, right?

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.079
Travel the world.

00:32:05.079 --> 00:32:05.640
Enjoy life.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.519
Eat good food, right?

00:32:06.519 --> 00:32:08.039
If you keep going on like this,

00:32:08.039 --> 00:32:08.880
I'm telling you,

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.240
your pancreatic cancer...

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.079
will show up five years earlier than it did before.

00:32:13.119 --> 00:32:13.680
Don't hit me!

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.000
I'm telling you.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.680
I'm telling you the truth.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.839
Don't ignore good advice just because it hurts.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.319
Xiaocan.

00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:25.559
When Mom brought you to this city back then,

00:32:27.359 --> 00:32:28.279
it wasn't like this.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:31.759
It's changed a lot for the better.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.000
When Mom came here back then,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.720
I had less than four hundred yuan to my name.

00:32:38.839 --> 00:32:41.319
My wallet was stolen as soon as I got off the train.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.759
Luckily, I had hidden some money in my shoe.

00:32:46.279 --> 00:32:47.720
I remember holding you,

00:32:48.519 --> 00:32:50.319
standing in front of that square.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.599
Mom didn't know where to catch the bus.

00:32:54.599 --> 00:32:55.880
I wasn't familiar with the area either.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.400
At that moment,

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:02.519
I didn't feel much for myself,

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.240
but I felt so sorry for my son.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:07.720
I swore then,

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:10.200
I would give you a good life.

00:33:11.839 --> 00:33:12.880
So for the past twenty years,

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.519
Mom worked desperately to make money.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.400
Bought an apartment.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.880
Saved up a little money.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.119
But who could have guessed,

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.640
I'd end up getting seriously ill later on?

00:33:26.319 --> 00:33:26.960
But Mom,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
none of us expected,

00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:31.359
that our family would get a windfall from demolition compensation.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:37.519
Son,

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.119
but this demolition compensation

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.559
isn't enough to support

00:33:43.559 --> 00:33:45.359
the so-called wonderful rest of your life.

00:33:49.039 --> 00:33:49.640
Mom knows

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.960
you think I'm living

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.720
a repetitive life, day after day.

00:33:54.119 --> 00:33:55.200
But actually, that's not true.

00:33:56.039 --> 00:33:57.039
I used to make money

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.759
hoping that the two of us

00:33:58.759 --> 00:34:00.279
could survive in this city.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.240
Now I make money

00:34:02.599 --> 00:34:04.359
hoping that we can live well.

00:34:07.119 --> 00:34:08.599
Mom has fulfilled her dream, too.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.840
I went to college,

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:11.599
and using the knowledge I learned,

00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:12.960
I'm working here and making money now.

00:34:13.039 --> 00:34:13.760
Isn't that great?

00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:16.400
Mom is doing what she loves.

00:34:17.079 --> 00:34:19.119
This is what Mom considers the best days.

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:24.199
Besides,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.679
it seems now there is also a

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.480
son who is slowly growing up.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.000
How wonderful.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:31.760
Right?

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:38.199
Mom

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:42.360
Are you truly happy right now?

00:34:48.039 --> 00:34:48.639
Of course.

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:53.719
I've got your back.

00:34:55.079 --> 00:34:55.440
Let's go home.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.079
Didn't I come here to persuade Mom to quit Wanxiang?

00:35:01.559 --> 00:35:02.480
How did I end up switching sides?

00:35:07.639 --> 00:35:09.039
It's too hard to find a job this year.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.039
Li Wai still hasn't...

00:35:10.039 --> 00:35:11.480
...received a single offer letter yet.

00:35:12.159 --> 00:35:13.519
He was joking that...

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.679
...he wouldn't do his thesis defense this year.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.280
Just slack off and defer graduation for a year.

00:35:17.719 --> 00:35:18.239
But then...

00:35:18.719 --> 00:35:20.719
The third-ranked student in his class failed four subjects on purpose.

00:35:21.239 --> 00:35:22.719
Now Li Wai can't even get a spot to defer graduation.

00:35:23.119 --> 00:35:25.000
I remember Li Wai's grades were pretty good, weren't they?

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:25.440
Yeah.

00:35:25.719 --> 00:35:27.199
His professional skills are great.

00:35:27.199 --> 00:35:28.320
But his comprehensive score isn't.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.280
Especially PE.

00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:31.199
He can't even outrun me in the physical test.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.480
For real?

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.440
You bet.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.639
He's hopeless.

00:35:35.039 --> 00:35:35.639
Seriously.

00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:36.760
Guifang.

00:35:37.199 --> 00:35:39.559
I just noticed you bought a lot of stuff today.

00:35:39.559 --> 00:35:40.239
Yeah.

00:35:40.239 --> 00:35:41.440
All for Xiaocan, right?

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:41.960
That's right.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:43.840
You really are an intern now.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.599
You've got money.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.800
Actually, agronomy isn't a career black hole.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.719
Look at seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides.

00:35:50.719 --> 00:35:51.920
The salaries are pretty high.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.599
If you guys don't switch careers...

00:35:53.679 --> 00:35:55.039
...it's actually quite lucrative.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.039
Xiaoyin and I opening an online shop is also lucrative.

00:35:59.039 --> 00:36:00.840
But are you happy?

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.079
I am.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.280
You guys have no idea.

00:36:03.519 --> 00:36:04.400
A couple of days ago...

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.039
...when I was reporting to my boss...

00:36:06.159 --> 00:36:07.840
...it was all English research papers.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.119
After I finished organizing them...

00:36:09.119 --> 00:36:11.079
...I stood by the printer...

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.760
...and watched those sheets...

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:13.880
...of Chinese-English comparison tables...

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:14.679
...popping out.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.480
I can't tell you how accomplished I felt.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.239
I had just one thought in my mind.

00:36:19.239 --> 00:36:19.679
I thought...

00:36:20.159 --> 00:36:21.480
..."I am so awesome."

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.920
"I can actually understand all this."

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.039
But...

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.480
It's written all over your face. "But."

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.280
But...

00:36:39.119 --> 00:36:40.760
Domestic seeds are sold by weight.

00:36:41.239 --> 00:36:43.159
Imported seeds are sold by the grain.

00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:45.119
Imported seeds...

00:36:45.199 --> 00:36:46.119
...have monopolized the market.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:47.960
Our company opts for convenience.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.119
They don't give domestic breeding a single chance.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.719
In the two years I spent with Professor Wang...

00:36:53.679 --> 00:36:55.159
...we knocked on doors everywhere but couldn't get in.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:56.960
Now...

00:36:58.199 --> 00:36:59.400
...I've become someone on the inside.

00:37:00.159 --> 00:37:02.360
Sometimes I even have to block the door.

00:37:07.239 --> 00:37:08.719
But now, without hesitation...

00:37:08.719 --> 00:37:10.239
...I can buy clothes and shoes for Xiaocan.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:10.760
Look.

00:37:11.199 --> 00:37:13.119
And I can buy so many at once.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.519
I wouldn't have dared to imagine that before.

00:37:14.519 --> 00:37:16.440
How could I have known I'd earn this much money?

00:37:17.639 --> 00:37:18.800
Our hearts just aren't in it.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.760
If we don't do it, then we don't.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.320
Fang'er, you really need to think this through.

00:37:29.119 --> 00:37:32.000
A loving heart brings life energy.

00:37:32.519 --> 00:37:34.320
Let's welcome today's guest...

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:37.840
...one of the Century's Top Ten Filial Sons, Mr. Kong Xiaocan.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:46.840
It really brings back memories

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.320
Please sit

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.000
Mr. Kong's story,

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.440
I'm sure everyone knows it

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.199
He paid fifty years of his own life

00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:55.440
in exchange for his mother's new life

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:56.960
Mr. Kong,

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.119
could you tell us what you were thinking at the time?

00:38:01.199 --> 00:38:05.119
I didn't really think much about it at the time

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.440
Really? I don't believe it

00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:09.920
I really didn't think much

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.599
So it was a completely subconscious act

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.039
You saw your mother in pain,

00:38:15.039 --> 00:38:15.920
and felt unwilling to accept it,

00:38:16.119 --> 00:38:17.719
so subconsciously,

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.840
you exchanged fifty years of your life

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:20.400
Right?

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:21.960
Maybe

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.239
That is truly so touching

00:38:24.239 --> 00:38:25.000
You are truly amazing

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:25.480
Thank you

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:26.559
So, Mr. Kong,

00:38:26.719 --> 00:38:28.559
what was the driving force behind all this?

00:38:29.519 --> 00:38:30.599
Driving force...

00:38:31.039 --> 00:38:34.079
Maybe I felt that as a son...

00:38:34.079 --> 00:38:34.880
I was too much of a failure

00:38:36.159 --> 00:38:37.719
No, as a son...

00:38:37.719 --> 00:38:38.679
I was too incompetent

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.559
As a son...

00:38:40.559 --> 00:38:43.320
I caused my mother too much worry

00:38:43.519 --> 00:38:44.639
Well, not exactly

00:38:44.639 --> 00:38:45.880
So you resolutely

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.119
exchanged your own energy

00:38:47.119 --> 00:38:47.880
for your mother

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.039
Not really... I'm right, aren't I?

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.840
Not entirely. I'm okay

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.880
I wasn't that much of a troublemaker, actually

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:54.840
Not that troublesome

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.519
Then can you talk about the troublesome parts?

00:38:58.199 --> 00:38:59.480
I was never really troublesome

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.440
According to rumors,

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:01.360
Kong Xiaocan

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.679
has been a troublesome child since he was young

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.480
He stole eggplants from home,

00:39:05.719 --> 00:39:07.239
stole the neighbor's pressure cooker,

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.920
and even scammed his mother out of money,

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.960
then secretly went traveling,

00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:11.000
and bought sneakers

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.599
Stuck with such a child,

00:39:12.719 --> 00:39:14.760
his mother fell ill over time

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.320
She went to the hospital for a checkup,

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.239
and at first thought it was just ordinary

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.320
stomach trouble

00:39:19.519 --> 00:39:21.440
But checks revealed it was severe

00:39:21.719 --> 00:39:22.440
late-stage pancreatic cancer

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.199
It really makes one feel re-

00:39:24.199 --> 00:39:24.719
gretful

00:39:30.159 --> 00:39:31.920
Isn't that... hasn't everyone heard that?

00:39:32.599 --> 00:39:33.440
How could this happen?

00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:35.599
It's truly heartbreaking, isn't it?

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.599
Actually, I feel...

00:39:38.599 --> 00:39:40.679
I still feel very guilty

00:39:42.159 --> 00:39:42.480
No

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.480
I still have a lot of unwillingness in my heart

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.400
But,

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.719
if I could have treated Mom

00:39:46.719 --> 00:39:48.199
a little better back then,

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.719
maybe none of this would have happened

00:39:52.199 --> 00:39:54.360
So you resolutely chose

00:39:54.519 --> 00:39:56.480
to exchange your life energy

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.320
to make his mother healthy again

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.000
It's truly so touching, isn't it?

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:15.639
Mr. Kong, you exchanged fifty years of life

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.239
Does that mean you don't want to live anymore?

00:40:17.559 --> 00:40:18.000
Yes

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.079
Isn't this what you wanted?

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.320
Everyone's simulation of human behavior

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.440
still needs improvement

00:40:27.639 --> 00:40:29.519
Now, four years have passed

00:40:29.719 --> 00:40:30.119
Well?

00:40:30.199 --> 00:40:32.000
What do you think of that choice now?

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:34.760
Look

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.199
His hesitation

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.480
is telling us

00:40:37.599 --> 00:40:40.639
that silence represents his loyalty

00:40:41.239 --> 00:40:43.199
Death befalls all men alike

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.719
It may be lighter than a feather

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.800
or heavier than Mount Tai

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.119
And Mr. Kong

00:40:47.239 --> 00:40:50.079
chose a greater way

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:54.800
Let's give a round of applause to the filial son, Kong Xiaocan

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:56.360
Well said!

00:40:56.679 --> 00:40:57.480
Good!

00:40:58.599 --> 00:40:58.960
Good!

00:40:59.159 --> 00:40:59.559
Good!

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.280
Let's wish him a life of one hundred and eighty years

00:41:02.599 --> 00:41:03.679
Is this my real time?

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.639
You definitely won't live that long

00:41:06.679 --> 00:41:07.840
Alright, everyone

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.960
Are you Ms. Kong Guifang?

00:41:12.679 --> 00:41:13.480
To think there are still

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.199
people other than insiders who know the details

00:41:16.559 --> 00:41:18.360
You must have mixed feelings

00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:21.760
Yes

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.679
At such a close distance

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.760
what we can do

00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:28.440
is very limited

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.679
As time passes

00:41:35.239 --> 00:41:36.320
he will blame himself

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.280
wondering why he has to die so early

00:41:41.199 --> 00:41:42.719
He'll worry about what you'll do

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.800
He will constantly

00:41:46.679 --> 00:41:47.400
talk about death

00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:49.760
and keep bringing it up

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.400
deliberately provoking you

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:54.719
making you angry

00:41:55.039 --> 00:41:57.079
Can you at least tell me how I die?

00:41:57.079 --> 00:41:58.559
What if I die from food safety issues?

00:41:58.639 --> 00:41:59.960
I just want to know when I'll die

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.960
You can coax him

00:42:04.119 --> 00:42:05.079
or you can yell at him

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.159
But the one thing

00:42:12.239 --> 00:42:14.000
is that you cannot cry with him

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:20.599
Because he

00:42:22.159 --> 00:42:24.000
is actually the one who is most afraid

00:42:27.039 --> 00:42:28.800
If you cry in front of him

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.679
that resolve he's been holding on to

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:36.760
will dissipate

00:42:39.239 --> 00:42:40.119
If it dissipates

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.679
that resolve

00:42:44.599 --> 00:42:46.079
can never be gathered again

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.760
So

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.000
so I cannot cry

00:42:57.599 --> 00:42:58.599
I cannot fall apart

00:43:00.719 --> 00:43:01.519
All of this

00:43:03.239 --> 00:43:04.239
will come to an end

00:43:08.039 --> 00:43:12.119
Madam, your eyeballs seem to be leaking water

00:43:23.039 --> 00:43:23.559
Thank you.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.039
Thank you all for your cooperation.

00:43:27.119 --> 00:43:28.039
Thanks for your hard work.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.880
Don't get too excited just yet.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.840
I've done what I promised you.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:33.760
When will my mom quit?

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:34.920
Don't worry.

00:43:36.239 --> 00:43:36.880
Monday.

00:43:37.679 --> 00:43:39.280
It'll be your mom's last day.

00:43:41.239 --> 00:43:44.239
It'll be your mom's last day at work.

00:43:46.079 --> 00:43:47.239
Your hosting style...

00:43:47.719 --> 00:43:48.920
Lay off those talk shows.

00:43:52.079 --> 00:43:53.079
I learned all that from them.

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:55.800
I'm so full. Stuffed.

00:43:56.199 --> 00:43:58.159
Me too. My belly is huge.

00:43:58.719 --> 00:43:59.400
Me too.

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.960
That place was pretty good, though.

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:02.840
Let's go again next time.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.920
I don't want to go home. I don't want to sleep.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:06.599
Shall we go to the next place?

00:44:06.599 --> 00:44:07.679
Let's sit a while longer.

00:44:08.039 --> 00:44:08.920
Let's not, Fang'er.

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:09.719
We're a bit tired.

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.599
Plus, Xi and I have to get up early tomorrow.

00:44:11.599 --> 00:44:12.320
To pack and ship orders.

00:44:13.159 --> 00:44:14.480
And I only have one day off.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.280
Alright.

00:44:17.039 --> 00:44:17.960
See you in class the day after tomorrow.

00:44:18.639 --> 00:44:19.199
See you at school.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:20.280
Bye.

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:21.519
Xiaocan's shoes.

00:44:21.639 --> 00:44:22.119
Thanks.

00:44:22.599 --> 00:44:23.119
You should head back.

00:44:23.199 --> 00:44:24.480
Okay, we'll get going then.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.039
We're off, Fang'er.

00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:25.679
Bye, bye.

00:44:25.679 --> 00:44:26.360
Stay safe.

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.159
Text me when you get there.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.400
Bye.

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:28.840
Bye.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:45.840
But...

00:44:47.519 --> 00:44:49.199
Domestic seeds sell by the pound.

00:44:49.719 --> 00:44:51.480
Imported seeds sell by the grain.

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.400
Imported seeds have monopolized the market.

00:44:55.119 --> 00:44:56.199
Our company takes the easy way out.

00:44:56.599 --> 00:44:58.280
And gives domestic breeding no chance.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.000
Now...

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.199
I've become an insider.

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:05.039
Sometimes I even have to block the door.

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.159
Fang'er, you really need to think this through.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:10.840
Mom.

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.960
Are you really happy right now?

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:28.360
Guifang.

00:45:29.079 --> 00:45:29.639
What a coincidence.

00:45:30.199 --> 00:45:32.039
Xiaotian, why are you here?

00:45:32.039 --> 00:45:32.880
I just finished streaming.

00:45:33.119 --> 00:45:34.039
Where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:35.639
Is that okay?

00:45:35.639 --> 00:45:36.440
It's fine, it's fine. Let's go.

00:45:37.199 --> 00:45:37.760
Thanks.

00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:55.840
By the way, Guifang.

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.079
Let me show you something.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:45:59.800
Look.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.239
The agricultural aid products I sell...

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.039
The revenue goes to the poverty alleviation fund.

00:46:05.519 --> 00:46:07.480
But I can use the tips however I want.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:09.079
So I took the money...

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.000
And donated it all to my hometown's irrigation project.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.760
I've saved enough for the first phase.

00:46:16.199 --> 00:46:18.519
The township government wants to call it Mingtian Dam.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:19.880
But my dad didn't agree.

00:46:20.239 --> 00:46:22.280
He said if it's called that...

00:46:22.599 --> 00:46:23.920
Then people walking across the dam...

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.960
Would be like stepping on him.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:27.440
Not bad, right?

00:46:29.039 --> 00:46:30.039
That's really great.

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.960
Your dream is slowly coming true.

00:46:33.519 --> 00:46:33.960
How about you?

00:46:35.079 --> 00:46:35.719
How have you been lately?

00:46:36.519 --> 00:46:38.280
Since Brother Maizi took the house back...

00:46:38.679 --> 00:46:40.039
We haven't chatted like this in a long time.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.239
As for me now...

00:46:42.239 --> 00:46:43.519
I joined an agricultural company.

00:46:43.639 --> 00:46:44.239
I'm an intern.

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.719
My salary is high.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:52.400
And?

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.679
And...

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.320
That's about it.

00:47:12.599 --> 00:47:13.000
Guifang.

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:14.679
We haven't seen each other in a long time.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:15.800
Let's take a selfie.

00:47:16.119 --> 00:47:16.599
Sure.

00:47:22.559 --> 00:47:22.880
Look.

00:47:30.039 --> 00:47:30.639
It's nice.

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:31.519
Send it to me.

00:47:31.719 --> 00:47:32.239
Okay.

00:47:46.719 --> 00:47:47.360
Who got the guaranteed spot?

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.440
Who got the guaranteed spot?

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:51.400
Tell us.

00:47:53.639 --> 00:47:54.639
Professor Li

00:47:55.039 --> 00:47:56.480
Just got a huge grant.

00:47:56.719 --> 00:47:58.679
Wants to add a grad student spot.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.159
Calculating the four-year comprehensive score...

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.800
The first place already landed a spot.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.880
The second place is going abroad.

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.400
So what about the third place, Wang Nei?

00:48:07.559 --> 00:48:08.039
Last sem...

00:48:08.679 --> 00:48:10.119
Failed four subjects last semester.

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.199
Deferred graduation.

00:48:11.679 --> 00:48:12.480
So...

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.599
This guaranteed spot...

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.280
It falls to you.

00:48:17.639 --> 00:48:18.360
Young man.

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.199
Exercise more.

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.440
Ignoring the physical test...

00:48:21.719 --> 00:48:22.400
You are the m...

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.360
You are number one in major courses.

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.039
Luck is also a form of skill.

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:32.440
You've insulted the guaranteed spot.

00:48:32.679 --> 00:48:33.880
You've insulted philosophy.

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.119
Aren't you guys happy for me?

00:48:39.559 --> 00:48:40.079
You've changed.

00:48:41.039 --> 00:48:41.800
You all have little secrets now.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.239
You're leaving me out.

00:48:48.239 --> 00:48:48.679
Jealousy.

00:49:08.119 --> 00:49:09.000
This one is new, right?

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.480
You've been to the countryside so many times.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:12.760
And you still dare to provoke geese?

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.400
Young people, you know.

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.719
To put it harshly, all appetite, no memory.

00:49:17.079 --> 00:49:18.760
To put it nicely, just do it.

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.960
We're going to Wengshui Township this afternoon, right?

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.920
Promoting new seedlings or teaching new methods?

00:49:24.559 --> 00:49:25.119
Promoting new methods.

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:27.679
This village has forty-six households.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.119
Securing twenty would be a victory for Wengshui.

00:49:32.119 --> 00:49:32.800
Professor Wang.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:34.639
Collected them all.

00:49:35.039 --> 00:49:36.079
Long time no see, Senior Sister.

00:49:36.639 --> 00:49:37.480
You guys chat then.

00:49:37.599 --> 00:49:38.360
I'll head out first.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:39.400
Bye-bye.

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.440
Is work going smoothly?

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:48.760
No.

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:50.920
I actually came today...

00:49:51.199 --> 00:49:53.119
Just to complain to you about the seed company.

00:49:53.199 --> 00:49:54.679
How conservative and arrogant they are.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.440
And then you tell me...

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.519
Breeding new domestic seeds...

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.280
Is far more meaningful than making money.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.519
Meaning is given by people.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:05.679
Gold shines wherever it is.

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.079
I like planting.

00:50:10.199 --> 00:50:11.199
Every grain comes from hard work.

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.639
But this industry is truly hard.

00:50:13.639 --> 00:50:14.480
If I leave...

00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.920
You won't have the super strong...

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.760
Assistant who isn't afraid of manure anymore.

00:50:20.119 --> 00:50:22.079
You know dreams can't feed you.

00:50:28.599 --> 00:50:30.760
Let's proceed as previously arranged for now.

00:50:31.559 --> 00:50:32.360
Get the job done first.

00:50:32.719 --> 00:50:33.119
Alright.

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.239
If nothing else, meeting adjourned.

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:36.159
Okay.

00:50:37.599 --> 00:50:38.079
Director Zhang.

00:50:39.679 --> 00:50:40.760
I'd like to say a few more words.

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:44.360
Domestic Guangtian tomato seeds are 0.18 a pack.

00:50:44.679 --> 00:50:46.800
Imported 223 and 677...

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.159
Hiked their prices this year.

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:49.960
Have already risen to 0.60 per seed.

00:50:50.519 --> 00:50:53.039
Domestic tomatoes yield 3,000 to 4,000 kg per mu.

00:50:53.519 --> 00:50:55.000
But imported ones can yield 6,000 to 7,000 kg.

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.880
And domestic tomatoes squash easily.

00:50:57.039 --> 00:50:58.400
When we count transport costs...

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.079
Imported ones are still more cost-effective.

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.119
What you're talking about...

00:51:01.119 --> 00:51:02.679
Is data from five years ago.

00:51:03.039 --> 00:51:03.920
Everyone, look at this.

00:51:05.119 --> 00:51:07.039
Domestic Guangtian, Yuxin...

00:51:07.239 --> 00:51:08.159
And Chunxiao.

00:51:08.519 --> 00:51:10.639
Yield at least 5,000 kg per mu.

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:11.760
Guangtian's fruit is firm.

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.480
Easy to transport and store.

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:14.800
The taste isn't as good as Yuxin.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.599
Yuxin is larger in size.

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.039
With a strong tomato flavor.

00:51:18.159 --> 00:51:19.679
Can be sold as fruit tomatoes.

00:51:20.199 --> 00:51:22.559
This year, the cheapest imported fruit tomato seeds...

00:51:22.679 --> 00:51:24.039
Have also risen to 0.90 per seed.

00:51:27.159 --> 00:51:29.280
Following the market is safe.

00:51:30.039 --> 00:51:30.719
When...

00:51:30.719 --> 00:51:32.000
Domestic seeds take the majority share...

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:33.519
Then we can switch.

00:51:37.159 --> 00:51:38.519
Seeds are the microchips of agriculture.

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.280
You aren't just buying a batch of seeds.

00:51:43.079 --> 00:51:44.559
But the hope of domestic breeding.

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:16.480
Zhou Kun

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:17.239
Here

00:52:18.519 --> 00:52:19.000
Zhou Qiang

00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:19.800
Here

00:52:20.199 --> 00:52:20.880
Zhang Ruifang

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:21.280
Here

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:23.480
Alright

00:52:25.199 --> 00:52:25.800
Everyone's here

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:27.360
Driver, let's go

00:52:27.559 --> 00:52:28.480
Wait a minute, wait a minute

00:52:29.239 --> 00:52:29.840
Wait a minute

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.719
Agronomy Department, Kong Guifang reporting for duty

00:52:46.519 --> 00:52:47.440
Now everyone's here

00:52:47.639 --> 00:52:48.679
Driver, go

00:52:54.079 --> 00:52:56.360
Since we have a spokesperson for energy exchange

00:52:56.639 --> 00:52:58.280
And a classic success case

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:00.480
Our performance has skyrocketed

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.960
This marketing stuff is really complicated

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:10.320
Before, we just blindly recommended the exchange

00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:13.000
But forgot about the consumer's psychological state

00:53:13.199 --> 00:53:14.599
What do consumers need?

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.519
They need success stories

00:53:16.639 --> 00:53:17.840
They need positive reviews

00:53:18.039 --> 00:53:18.960
Once there's a success

00:53:19.039 --> 00:53:20.800
They have an anchor point in their minds

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.559
Then they are willing to trade

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.519
You really do live and learn

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:30.039
Why is there only Xiaocan's story?

00:53:31.039 --> 00:53:32.719
What about Guifang, the lifespan recipient?

00:53:34.519 --> 00:53:36.559
Where is Kong Guifang's story?

00:53:36.559 --> 00:53:37.920
It's just relatively ordinary

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:38.960
Not much of a story there

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:39.880
Nonsense

00:53:41.039 --> 00:53:41.800
As far as I know

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:43.199
Guifang regained her youth

00:53:43.199 --> 00:53:43.960
Went to university

00:53:44.199 --> 00:53:45.920
Started a whole new path in life

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.599
Now she's doing agricultural research

00:53:47.599 --> 00:53:49.039
And she's even interning here with us

00:53:49.039 --> 00:53:50.239
What a great story that is

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.639
You guys don't know how to dig at all

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:54.440
If I hadn't been going through Duda's breeding files

00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:55.639
And seen her name

00:53:55.639 --> 00:53:56.800
We would have missed out

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.800
On such great material

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.199
Kong Guifang

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:04.519
Yes, that works

00:54:05.119 --> 00:54:06.639
I can't make it at 2 PM

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.119
My assistant can go over

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.840
She knows a lot about breeding

00:54:10.239 --> 00:54:12.360
Good, then let's schedule it for 2 PM

00:54:12.599 --> 00:54:14.800
Looking forward to meeting student Kong Guifang

00:54:16.159 --> 00:54:16.920
Mr. Ma, hello

00:54:17.039 --> 00:54:17.719
Hello, hello

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.760
Would you be willing to intern at our company?

00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:32.880
Such an important client

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.440
We must treat them well

00:54:37.599 --> 00:54:38.000
Go home

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:47.239
It hasn't been easy for that mother and son

00:54:49.079 --> 00:54:51.400
Then why didn't you find a pair for the spokesperson?

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:58.039
The original plan was to promote the filial son

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:01.519
That won't do

00:55:02.519 --> 00:55:04.000
I have to talk to them personally

00:55:36.239 --> 00:55:37.280
Writing a resignation letter

00:55:41.719 --> 00:55:44.320
I have a high fever of 39.7 degrees right now

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.639
And the boss still won't approve my leave

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:47.920
Two more degrees and I'll be cooked

00:55:48.599 --> 00:55:51.679
I wish I could write the word "RUN" on my chest

00:55:52.079 --> 00:55:54.880
To warn all new employees to quit immediately

00:55:55.079 --> 00:55:56.719
A company like this deserves to go bankrupt

00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.840
Right? You think so too

00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:01.239
And this is supposed to be

00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:02.840
A large agricultural enterprise

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:04.039
A leading enterprise at that

00:56:04.599 --> 00:56:05.840
How does he usually operate?

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.760
Big trees have many bugs

00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:10.000
He doesn't sell the best, only the cheapest

00:56:10.159 --> 00:56:11.440
He doesn't use what he produces himself

00:56:11.639 --> 00:56:13.039
He just uses foreign trash

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.480
How can such a company exist?

00:56:14.679 --> 00:56:15.960
It's extremely ridiculous, right?

00:56:26.599 --> 00:56:27.159
Excuse me

00:56:27.159 --> 00:56:28.079
I'm done, you can use it

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.679
What a clown
