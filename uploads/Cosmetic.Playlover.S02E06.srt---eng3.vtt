WEBVTT

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.150
We were in the final stages of the shoot

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.100
for Yumihara Risa's bridal project,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.300
I'll leave this with you.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.480
You got it.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.310
I ended up buying everything Risa uses.

00:00:19.638 --> 00:00:21.690
The shades Yumihara-san uses

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.000
are incredibly popular at our store.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.046
But an unexpected accident
forced us back to square one.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.639
Everything had to start over.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.550
Here's what you asked for.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.140
Thanks.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.880
I'm about to head out.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.910
I'll leave the rest to you.

00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:36.590
Understood. I've got it from here.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.400
Thanks, I appreciate it.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.710
We don't have much
time left before the shoot.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.900
I need to finalize the concept quickly

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.090
and get it over to Touma.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.700
"Cosmetic Playlover" Season 2
(Episode 6)

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.150
These are the alternative
palettes we discussed.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.120
Oh.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.790
Yeah, these are cute.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.190
They'll look different once
they're actually applied,

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.769
so I've prepared a few other options...

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.770
Great.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.910
I have some overseas exclusives too.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.160
Please, take your pick.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.220
I have to say,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.080
it feels like I'm actually
being pampered. I love it.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.250
Now then...

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.580
Let me compare these eyeshadows.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.990
Oof.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.750
Oh, sorry about that.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.140
Um, what's this...?

00:02:33.023 --> 00:02:36.553
This is the kind of dress
I'd want to wear personally.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.820
It doesn't really suit my image, does it?

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.210
The truth is,

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.710
I actually love these cute styles.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.750
Things like lace and ruffles...

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.470
And I love pretty pinks, too.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.260
I've always been a girly girl at heart.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.960
But it's so different from
the "Yumihara Risa" brand.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.080
So, I only ever wear this stuff in private.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.200
I had no idea.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.590
Actually,

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.000
if I could wear my dream dress

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.309
for a collaboration with
ROMY, my favorite brand...

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.710
it would be like a dream come true.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.670
But,

00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:16.010
work is work, after all.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.090
ROMY is your favorite?

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.800
Yeah.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.839
Even before I started modeling,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.930
I was obsessed with ROMY's makeup.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.859
So when I got the offer to be their muse,

00:03:26.884 --> 00:03:28.364
I was over the moon.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.770
Oh.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.260
This eyeshadow...

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.330
It was the first thing I bought
with my part-time job money.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.700
Back when I was a student,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.180
my heart would race just
walking up to the ROMY counter.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.040
Everything was so sparkly and glamorous.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.540
I've been a huge fan ever since.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.000
To do a bridal shoot with ROMY makeup...

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.900
I feel so incredibly lucky.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.330
And having Touma, my old classmate,
in charge makes it even better.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.700
Yumihara-san...

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.590
I didn't realize she had
such a history with ROMY.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.950
It's true that the dress...

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.420
is a total departure from her usual image.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.329
That pink is a bit too soft and feminine.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.050
It doesn't quite fit the
"Yumihara Risa" brand.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.840
Thank you, come again.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.339
When it comes to fashion,

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.030
everyone has a style that naturally
complements their look and vibe.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.109
Her agency probably knows that,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.350
which is why they're so
careful with her image strategy.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.380
She must understand
that better than anyone.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.230
That's why she hasn't said a word about it.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.440
After that,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.420
the project reorganization
moved at an incredible pace.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.590
Out of the five bridal shoot concepts,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.720
four have already been finalized.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.580
Now,

00:05:01.581 --> 00:05:02.780
only the last one remains.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.960
This combination still feels a bit weak.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.190
The previous concept had such a perfect,

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.400
delicate balance that it
really left an impression.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.590
We've already used
the standard bridal look.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.590
If we want this to stand out,
we need something with more personality.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.439
By the way, Mamiya-san,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.000
you spoke with Yumihara-san at the meeting
the other day, right?

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:40.890
What was your impression of her?

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.080
Well...

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.620
Let me think.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.810
I've always been a girly girl at heart.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.640
But it's so different from
the "Yumihara Risa" brand.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.570
So, I only ever wear this stuff in private.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.970
I think she's someone who's
very dedicated to her work,

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.086
but also knows how to stay true to herself.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.220
She strikes me as a
person with a very strong will.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.310
A certain kind of... resilience?

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.270
Resilience.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.430
I see.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.340
That's a great keyword to bring out
a different side of Yumihara-san.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.580
Maybe we've been

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.210
too focused on finding the right dress.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.230
In that case, how about a pantsuit?

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.400
It would perfectly
showcase her proportions.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.450
- I like it.
- Oh...

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.790
It's fresh for a bridal
shoot. It has real impact.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.629
Exactly! Let's go with that!

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.680
Wait...

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.020
Mamiya-san,

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.780
nice assist!

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.880
No...

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.420
That's not what I meant...

00:07:00.543 --> 00:07:02.433
I'm glad we could wrap things up smoothly.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.050
- I'll leave it to you all.
- Thank you, everyone.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.390
Good work, everyone.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.530
Good work.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:08.770
Good work.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.380
I'm looking forward to the results.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:12.670
- Thank you.
- Good work.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.200
Yoshioka-san,

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.880
I have a suggestion.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.150
Man... I'm beat.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.370
Is this what it's like
working at headquarters?

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.310
I've sent the final concept to Touma.

00:07:38.993 --> 00:07:40.503
That should be it for now.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.099
(Natsume: The concept is
ready. I just emailed it to you.)

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.838
(Touma: Thank you so much. I'll finish the
styling before I head back. Go ahead and sleep.)

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.600
Is that guy... really going to be okay?

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.990
Natsume-san.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.640
I'm home.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.620
You're back.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.520
Yeah, welcome home.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.380
Wait...

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:54.890
He's asleep?!

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.480
Is he really out?

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:00.860
There we go.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.510
Are you okay?

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.030
You woke me up... sorry...

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.510
Natsume-san, come sleep too...

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.060
I heard you've been
working really hard lately.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
I'm proud of you.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.480
You're doing a great job.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.270
Did Nanjo-san tell you that?

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.250
Why would he say that...

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.120
Working hard is just
what I'm supposed to do...

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.010
Huh?

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.860
I'm going to learn everything I can.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.080
I'll do it in two years,

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.880
and then I'll come back to you.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:24.910
Morning.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.250
Morning.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.380
You okay?

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.800
You were out like a light last night.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.410
A quick hug from you is all
I need to recharge. I'm fine.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.670
Don't you think "all I need" is a bit much?

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.980
Here, these are the test shots.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.660
Oh.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.580
You finished the last set too?

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.150
The files have already been sent over.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.680
That's impressive.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.510
Good work.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.900
Seriously, thanks.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.980
I'll make sure these get delivered.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.880
I'll leave it to you then.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.200
Yeah.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.000
Touma went to Osaka on a business trip.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:11.240
So cute.

00:11:11.241 --> 00:11:12.480
While I was at headquarters,

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.460
finishing the final checks with the staff.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.350
Then, I headed back to the store.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.040
Mamiya-san.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:21.990
Yeah?

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.150
Today, while you were at headquarters,

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.810
a male student came in wanting to try
the men's skincare line.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.379
I was the one who helped him.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.230
I see.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.329
He said he came in
because he saw your poster.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.290
Wait, mine?

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.330
Yes.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.189
He said he was nervous
since it was his first time,

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.060
but he worked up the courage to walk in.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.000
I really felt for him.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.610
Being part of someone's
"first time" like that...

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:46.690
It just made me really happy.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.220
Helping customers is so rewarding.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.089
Anyway, I'll get back to work.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:54.090
Okay.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:57.490
She's right.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:58.230
Welcome.

00:11:58.231 --> 00:11:59.370
As Beauty Advisors,

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.170
we're part of so many
milestones in our customers' lives.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.470
Someone buying a
lipstick as a gift for a friend.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.440
Someone buying sunscreen for a trip abroad.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.880
Or someone asking for
makeup advice for a job interview.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.330
And then,

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:29.740
there are those who cherish an eyeshadow
bought with their very first paycheck.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.320
Yumihara-san

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:34.700
isn't just the muse for ROMY,

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.050
she's also a valued customer.

00:12:39.733 --> 00:12:41.193
Tomorrow's shoot

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.500
has to be a success.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:54.790
Hello?

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.510
Good work today.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.800
Oh, I'm just about to leave the store.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.560
Let's grab dinner before we head home.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.370
Sure.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.049
After dealing with all that trouble,

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.570
that drink tasted amazing.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:17.869
Oh, but since the shoot is tomorrow,

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.429
I stuck to just one.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:20.430
Right.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.870
I feel like I'm finally getting
a taste of the real world.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.870
Interacting with people
from other companies...

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.280
Just to pull off one project,

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.850
so many people with different
roles have to work together.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.180
I see.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.299
In terms of broadening my horizons,

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.750
it's been a great experience.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.120
But right now, I just
want the shoot to go well

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.610
so I can get back to focusing on the store.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.140
Yeah.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:49.410
Huh?

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.350
What's with the one-word answers?

00:13:54.603 --> 00:13:55.953
Are you drunk already?

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.060
We're home~

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.400
Hey.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:13.980
Natsume-san.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:17.340
Touma.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:18.860
Take it easy.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.080
Natsume-san.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.470
I worked really hard on that trip.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.560
I know.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.700
I worked really hard on the styling, too.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.000
Yes, you did.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.000
I wanted to see you so badly,

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.370
so I rushed back as fast as I could.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:41.470
I see.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.350
I want you to praise me...

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.640
Is that okay?

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:53.990
Oh.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.940
Exhaustion plus alcohol...

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.850
Touma is definitely not himself.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.590
Please praise me...

00:15:09.393 --> 00:15:10.393
Please...

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.520
You did great.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.070
Good boy.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:20.450
More.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:22.590
Tell me more.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.430
You work so hard, it's amazing.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.500
And you're so handsome.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.570
You're so talented with your hands.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.930
And you smell so good.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.580
I love you so much, Natsume-san.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.540
What about you?

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:47.690
I love you too.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.000
What do you love about me?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.310
You're reliable.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.750
And hardworking.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.080
And you're so kind.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:04.600
I love you the most, Natsume-san.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:06.710
Hey.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.320
Hey, wait a second...

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.720
I was so lonely while we were apart.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:23.950
Don't just say things
like that out of nowhere.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:50.850
I had no idea you were such a clingy drunk.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.660
It's the first time I've
seen it. You surprised me.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.090
Are you feeling better now?

00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:59.490
Yeah.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.080
It's the first time I've
ever been like that.

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:05.090
Really?

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.319
I only had one drink.

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.670
I even surprised myself.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:15.700
Listen.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.960
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:27.250
If you get sick while you're in Paris,

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.810
I won't be able to just
rush over to see you.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.620
No matter how exhausted
you are when you get home,

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.370
I won't be there to tuck you into bed.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:42.750
And if you get drunk
like you did yesterday,

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:45.180
I won't be there for you to lean on.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.800
Once we're long-distance,

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:52.030
no matter what happens,

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.220
I'll...

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.440
only be able to worry from afar.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.260
So you have to promise me

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:18.370
that you won't overdo it.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.120
I promise.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.580
You seem really anxious.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:31.730
After seeing you like that yesterday,

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.000
how could I not be?

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:44.980
I'm sorry.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.620
It's okay.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.919
Should we scatter some rose petals?

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.460
- No, I don't think we need that.
- Oh?

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.490
They're already prepared,
so let's just leave it for now.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.390
Sahashi, do you need any help?

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.880
I'm good for now.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.170
Could you assist me
when I start the makeup?

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.640
You got it.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.300
What do you mean?

00:19:35.301 --> 00:19:38.469
- There's a traffic jam due to an accident...
- A jam? What am I supposed to do about that?

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:39.420
I'm so sorry.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.000
Someone will have to go pick them up...

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.489
This is the absolute worst.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.260
Um... is something wrong?

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.890
The roses we ordered

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.430
are stuck in traffic
because of an accident.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.490
Someone needs to go get them.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:56.350
I'll go.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.200
Wait, but...

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.840
I'm mostly just here to observe anyway.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.036
I'm the only one with free time right now.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.960
The rest of you should keep getting ready.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.100
Understood.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.650
- Thanks, I appreciate it.
- We're counting on you.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.290
Yumihara Risa-san will be arriving shortly.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:14.060
I'm heading out then.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.180
Good luck.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.340
Natsume-san.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.170
Oh, sorry.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.240
About assisting you...

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:24.470
Be careful out there.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:28.150
Thanks, I'm off.

00:20:31.477 --> 00:20:33.907
Will Mamiya-san be okay on his own?

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:35.420
He'll be fine.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.010
Let's just focus on our own jobs.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:39.820
Right.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.230
Natsume-san,

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.050
you really never change, do you?

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.120
Always putting yourself second,

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.540
always thinking of others.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:13.940
Hey.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.010
Touma, do you have a lover?

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:19.790
What makes you say that?

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:21.950
Woman's intuition.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.480
I don't know,

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.230
your expression is much
softer than it used to be.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.020
You must be very happy together.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:31.580
Well...

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.060
What are they like?

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.490
What do you love about them?

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.340
Everything.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.200
Their kindness...

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.640
The way they try to act tough...

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.130
When they're happy,

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.260
when they're anxious...

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.940
Even the way their expressions
are always changing.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.940
I'm head over heels for every part of them.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:09.860
They have this inner warmth

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.170
that just naturally saves
everyone around them.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.790
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.340
Thank you.

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:40.010
Here you go.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.440
Thanks.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:48.170
Um...

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.480
This outfit...

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.740
I heard it was your idea, Mamiya-san.

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:02.250
For all these years,

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.070
thank you so much for loving ROMY.

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.160
As a ROMY Beauty Advisor,

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.910
please allow me to
offer you my best wishes.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.050
Mamiya-san.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.676
I'll leave the rest to you.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:25.700
Of course.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.490
Alright, let's start the shoot.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.060
Here we go.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:35.120
One more.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.430
Yeah.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.040
I didn't realize Yumihara-san
could pull off this look too.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.489
She's so cute.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:46.650
It's a whole new side of her.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:50.669
Yeah, that's great.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.760
Oh, this is good.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.869
Next up is the ring shot.
Everyone, get ready.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.670
Please.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:04.190
Taking the shot.

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:06.090
Nice.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.090
Perfect.

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:21.850
No matter what,

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:24.910
I want to protect this sincere person.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.160
This one is great.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:39.980
Natsume-san.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.826
(Next Episode)
Where are you going with Mamiya-kun?

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:48.850
