=Episode 23=

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.900
Uncle-in-law, your sudden approach

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.420
makes me rather uneasy.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.980
You're not uneasy.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.460
You're calm and composed.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.100
Tonight, we're merely
competing in speed.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.940
It seems you are faster.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.899
I bet you took down

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.540
my shadow guards.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.940
I only wish to know

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.499
why I must die
at the hands of my own kin.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.020
Enough nonsense.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.540
You already knew my identity.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.820
Don't speak of kinship.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.380
My aunt now carries your child.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.620
Does that count for nothing?

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.819
Your aunt has miscarried.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.420
If her life is in danger,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.420
then we are no longer kin.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.100
Zhen Xiuyi has already
let go of the hatred.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.299
You should stop clinging

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.020
to the grudges of the past!

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.940
Brother!

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.580
Brother!

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.780
Stop!

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.100
Wuju was harmed because of me.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.060
How can I still go on living?

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.260
Brother!

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.740
Xiao Man.

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:48.911
Put the blade down.

00:02:48.912 --> 00:02:50.152
I beg you.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.140
Brother.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.940
Uncle-in-law.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.220
I was lying just now.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.940
Aunt is in labour.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.579
If you go now, there's still time.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.299
Live once for yourself.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.420
Brother.

00:03:05.337 --> 00:03:06.697
Please live on.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.620
Live to see the one you love.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.379
Why are you still standing there?

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.740
Go, now.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.580
Aren't you going to punish me?

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.139
I promised Xiao Man

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.220
I would spare her entire family.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.700
Now that no one stands in the way,

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.180
whether you're guilty is
for Aunt to decide.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.420
She really is in labour.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.300
Go, quickly.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.540
Xiao Man...

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.580
She's given birth.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.020
A lovely little girl.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.060
She's still waiting for you.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.340
Don't disappoint her again.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.740
You're awake.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.020
I'll ask you one thing.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.940
All these years...

00:04:37.137 --> 00:04:39.737
Was it all just a means to have revenge?

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.539
Wuju, on the day we were married,

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.740
you were honest with me.

00:05:08.587 --> 00:05:10.107
But I wasn't.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.419
Now,

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.300
I can finally be honest with you.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.980
Sun Gong is Zhen Muyu.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.579
He's the boy who once declared

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.980
he would marry no one but you.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.219
And the young man

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.540
who became your Prince Consort.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.220
This is what Zhen Muyu
looked like as an adult.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.580
You and I

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.020
were never meant to be.

00:06:09.662 --> 00:06:11.542
I've wronged you.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.020
Sun Gong has taken poison!

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.620
Whoever bites into the middle first

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.540
wins.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.700
Then, I won't hold back.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.540
Just call her Princess.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.420
There's no need to call her family.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.420
I'll soon sever all ties with her.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.460
Do you really believe that yourself?

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.340
Ever since we met on the day
of the military examinations,

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.860
I made up my mind

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.020
not to wait for him anymore.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.379
Because I had found

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.860
my own destiny.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.540
From that moment on,

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.420
I didn't care
what became of Zhen Muyu.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.940
I only knew
how kind Sun Gong was to me.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.220
Muyu...

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.820
Muyu...

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.580
His Majesty and I never meant
to hold you accountable.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.900
Why go this far?

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.420
Our daughter...

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.820
I don't want to die.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.540
I don't want to die.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.380
The imperial physician is on the way.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.060
He'll be here any moment.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.900
It's too late.

00:09:40.762 --> 00:09:43.282
The hatred was real.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.740
But the love was real too.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.099
I did think about using you.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.340
But I couldn't control my feelings.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.900
I love you.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.700
I wanted to grow old with you.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.220
I wanted to watch our daughter grow up.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.620
I've never lived

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:15.900
for myself

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.270
since I was twelve.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.620
Whether you are Sun Gong

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.380
or Zhen Muyu...

00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:16.425
I love you all the same.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.860
I love you all the same.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.939
Your Majesty.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.380
Minister Sun passed away at dawn today.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.899
Before his death,
he left a letter for Eunuch Xiao Man.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.500
Present it at once.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.180
(Mujun, my dear sister.)

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.500
(This campaign)

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.500
(brings me back
to the frontier after twenty years.)

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.139
(When I saw
scattered lights flickering)

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.140
(beneath the mountain,)

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.060
(it felt as though I had rediscovered)

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.900
(my ambition of
guarding the frontier with Mother.)

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.340
(I've also begun
to understand your thoughts.)

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.299
(People often speak of
the tens of thousands of troops)

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.020
(and the frontier citizens
as if they were some vague collective.)

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.739
(But they are made up of)

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.740
(countless small families,)

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.660
(just like you and me.)

00:12:26.087 --> 00:12:28.700
(Everyone is living a real life.)

00:12:29.512 --> 00:12:30.912
(If I were to slay His Majesty,)

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.939
(it would plunge court
and realm into chaos,)

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.339
(the frontier into turmoil,)

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.300
(and bring ruin
to countless soldiers and lands)

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.300
(To fill the hatred in my heart)

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.300
(with countless living lives)

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.780
(would be unforgivable.)

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.700
(Uncle and I
have already committed grave sins.)

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.540
(Death would not
be too heavy a price.)

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.060
(I've failed our parents,)

00:12:55.512 --> 00:12:56.632
(And I've failed)

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.980
(my wife's love.)

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.940
(But what's done cannot be undone.)

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.460
(I've already taken poison.)

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.980
(Under the name of regicide,)

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.620
(I'll use my life to end this hatred.)

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:20.100
(I hope you will inherit
(our parents' final legacy.)

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.180
(This is farewell.)

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.660
(Your brother,)

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.340
(Muyu.)
