WEBVTT

00:00:00.014 --> 00:00:08.014

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:14.056
All right, check your gear.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.141
This is rarefied air, my friends.

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:20.437
HALO jumps aren't something
a lot of civilians get to do.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.105
Yeah!

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.569
We're jumping at 30,000 feet.
Mask up. Stay calm.

00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:29.029
Remember your training.

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:32.115
Let's go, guys.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:01:00.143
Whoo! That is what I'm
talking about, baby.

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:02.187
Damn, you landed like a bullet.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.774
Hey, guys, I think there's
something wrong with Padilla.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.237
Padilla! Hey!

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:38.849
I am so excited about this one.

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:40.517
Okay, Morgan.

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:42.019
Dare I ask why?

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.064 line:20%
The guy's alive when he jumps,
and dead when he hits the ground.

00:01:46.148 --> 00:01:48.525 line:20%
You're not excited to figure out
how you kill someone midair?

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:49.609 line:20%
We can't assume that.

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:52.821 line:20%
Could be he lost consciousness midair
and died on impact when he hit the ground.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:55.907 line:20%
Why would we be here if the medical
examiner didn't think it was murder?

00:01:55.991 --> 00:01:58.285 line:20%
Just try to keep your enthusiasm
at an appropriate level.

00:01:58.368 --> 00:01:59.369 line:20%
What do we know?

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:02.956 line:20%
Captain Alonso Padilla,
retired Air Force Special Recon.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.959 line:20%
Worked as a therapist on base
but still served in the reserves.

00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:07.544 line:20%
Taught skydiving here twice a week.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:11.173 line:20%
Seemed like everyone liked him,
until this. It was a routine jump.

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:12.674 line:20%
ME found this in his jumpsuit.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.219 line:20%
 "I know what you're doing.
Stop or die."

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:18.805 line:20%
One of Padilla's students
could've slipped that into his pocket.

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:20.807 line:20%
Or maybe someone else
did it on the ground.

00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:23.268 line:20%
The point of the note was to get him
to back off whatever he was doing.

00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:25.145 line:20%
Why threaten the guy
if you're about to kill him?

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:26.605 line:20%
Plus, this wasn't written today.

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:28.940 line:20%
I left my phone in the car. Give me yours.

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:30.609 line:20%
Uh, the last time
I let you borrow my phone--

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:33.445 line:20%
I changed the ringtone to "Baby Got Back."
I haven't heard the end of it.

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:35.280 line:20%
Just give me your phone.
This is work-related.

00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:36.782 line:20%
It wasn't funny.

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:40.577 line:20%
See, when you write
with ink, at first, the line is sharp,

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:44.414 line:20%
but because the ink has solvents in it,
over time, the line fades.

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:46.583 line:20%
<i>That's why you get
that little halo around the letters.</i>

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:50.379 line:20%
<i>A few days later, the solvent evaporates,
and the dye stays where it is.</i>

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.756 line:20%
So, this was written
at least a few days ago.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.301 line:20%
And Padilla was just walking around
with a death threat in his pocket?

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:58.220 line:20%
Maybe he was trying
to figure out who wrote it.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:00.013 line:20%
Maybe he was using it as motivation.

00:03:00.097 --> 00:03:02.557 line:20%
Well, whatever it is,
it's safe to say Padilla didn't stop

00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:04.351 line:20%
and the killer followed through.

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:07.229 line:20%
I think it's time to talk to his students.

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:11.066 line:20%
Couldn't he just had a heart attack,
plain and simple?

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.694 line:20%
Why? Did Padilla mention feeling sick?
Anything unusual?

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:15.362 line:20%
No, he was in good spirits.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.531 line:20%
Had a good talk with Suzie,
the medical examiner.

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.116 line:20%
- She gets it.
- She gets what?

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.992 line:20%
- Hi, I'm Morgan.
- Ethan.

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:24.204 line:20%
I was just about to ask
how long you'd known Alonso Padilla.

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:26.832 line:20%
Couple weeks. I just started coming here.

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:28.667 line:20%
Did he seem nervous
about the jump?

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.293 line:20%
Not from what I could tell.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.756 line:20%
Look, I wish I could help you out,
but if you want to speak to someone

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.551 line:20%
who knew him much better than I did,
that would be Tina.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.887 line:20%
I own this place,
and even I took lessons from Padilla.

00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:41.972 line:20%
Mmm.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.975 line:20%
His love of skydiving was infectious,

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:48.895 line:20%
and his military experience,
that was a big draw.

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:52.190 line:20%
But I don't know, lately it seemed
like he didn't wanna talk about it.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.651 line:20%
Well, Tina, from the moment
Padilla arrived here today

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:57.070 line:20%
until he went up in the jump plane,
did you notice anything suspicious?

00:03:57.154 --> 00:04:00.282 line:20%
No, everything was perfectly normal until...

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.537 line:20%
Sorry, I'm still processing all of this,
so... Um...

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.748 line:20%
He was a really good guy.

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:10.292 line:20%
Well, Tina, thank you.

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:13.003 line:20%
If we have any further questions,
we'll let you know.

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:18.133 line:20%
Hmm.

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.470 line:20%
- This is interesting.
- A blank white key card.

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:23.096 line:20%
The key card itself
isn't that interesting,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.431 line:20%
but the fact that it's here is.

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:26.975
It doesn't belong.
They use metal keys here.

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.185
Mm-hmm.

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.771
This could be for
a million different things.

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:33.023
Well, then let's go
whittle it down, big guy.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.737
All right, let's see what we have here.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.821
ME's report.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:42.240
Oh, God.
How did you get that so fast?

00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:44.659
I don't know what to tell you.
I'm extremely charming, Lieutenant, okay?

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:47.537
- Suzie fast-tracked it.
- Which we will talk about later.

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:51.541
Understood.
You guys wanna know how Padilla died?

00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:55.128
Hypoxia. It's lack of oxygen.

00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:56.213
He suffocated.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.798
Wait, the techs checked his gear.

00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:00.175
His helmet and oxygen mask
were working properly.

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:02.344
Any chance
it was a rare medical condition?

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:04.679
No. Doesn't explain the death threat.

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:06.765
We'll continue
to investigate this as a murder

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:08.558
unless we have reason
to believe otherwise.

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:11.728
A midair homicide.
I will work this case for free.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.648
I don't mean that.
That's just something people say.

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.733
Nice to see such dedication.

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:18.860
Solomon.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:22.322
What a nice surprise.
How can we help you?

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:26.284
Internal Affairs received information
that Ms. Gillory interfaced with our ME

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:29.454
without proper supervision,
instructing her to, quote,

00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:32.040
"Put a rush on the Padilla case. That's
a direct order from the higher-ups."

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:35.836
Well, no. That's maybe
a bit of a paraphrasing on Suzie's part.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.213
I just... She just... She did me a favor.

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:41.591
That favor cost us $12,000 in rush fees.

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:42.968
- What?
- Morgan.

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:44.427
I appreciate you letting us know,

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:46.847
and I will make sure that
this never happens again.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.973
- Yeah.
- Will you?

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.643
Can you honestly say that this
isn't just the most recent example

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:53.770
of her flouting procedure at every turn?

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:55.939
Okay, hang on there for just one second.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.984
I've never flouted anything.
Thank you very much.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:00.652
You sure about that?

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:03.238
- She's got a...
- Get off me.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:05.198
Oh.

00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:06.449
Wait.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.411
Yes, I am.

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:11.288
This marks one overstep too many.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.415
I'm sending you
to Detective Training Academy.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.296
Sorry, that... that's not a thing.
Detective Trai...

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.215
Okay, that sounds like
obedience school for cops.

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:23.300
More or less.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:28.054
Once you've completed the course,
you may resume regular duties.

00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:30.056
Are you serious?

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:31.850
Ugh.

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:33.768
All right, just...
I'm gonna finish this case,

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:35.604
and then I'll go to...
...your academy.

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:38.273
Uh, no, you may not.

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:42.485
And if you don't pass,
there won't be any more cases.

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.412
Look, I know you're being sent
for training,

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:54.581
you don't want to learn rules
that you will not follow.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:55.665
Wow, you're good.

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.043
But, full disclosure,
I helped create the course.

00:06:58.126 --> 00:06:59.711
Of course you did.

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:03.506
Great. I was worried I wouldn't
know exactly who to resent

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.050
while I'm stuck here.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:06.926
Please just keep an open mind.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.012
Are you asking me not
to start a fight with anyone?

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.764
That is exactly what I'm asking.

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:13.266
Adam. You're looking well.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.477
Dottie. You haven't changed a bit.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.313
Morgan. This is Sergeant Dottie Reynolds.
She runs the course.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.023
Hi, Dottie, nice to meet you.

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:23.985
Listen, you seem like a busy lady.
You do not need to be babysitting me.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.446
I had an idea.
Why don't I just take the final exam?

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:29.115
- Morgan.
- That's not how it works.

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.368
But with an open mind, it could be.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.246
It appears you're doing
the Lord's work with this one.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.998
- Hmm.
- Mmm.

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:39.751
Why would she say that?
What does that mean?

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:41.461
She read the memos.

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.506
There's no memos.

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:55.684
IA sent Morgan to detective school?

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:57.435
Yes, yes, I know.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:00.897
Silver lining though. I think
that this will be really good for her.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.316
Oh, I don't care about the class.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.820
I need to know what's going on in my squad
so I can stay ahead of things.

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.154
I got it under control.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:11.074
- Do you?
- Mm-hmm.

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:13.118
I heard about your case.

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:16.955
Padilla was Air Force, which means at
some point, JAG is gonna try and step in.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.582
Which is exactly why
I reached out to my contacts.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.335
Oh, good, because my contacts
already got back to me.

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:28.425
So, you already reached out
to your contacts on my case.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.093
Military cases are sensitive.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:33.263
So, I threw around some rank
to keep JAG from getting in the mix.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:35.765
Well, thank you for the assist.
I can take it from here.

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:38.810
Well, I'm actually going
to Padilla's house with Karadec.

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:42.147
Because you need to throw rank around
at the victim's house?

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.108
You're down a consultant, Lieutenant.
Thought I'd lend a helping hand.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.943
And when I need one, I'll come find you.

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:50.196
I'm already here.
Consider me your new secret weapon.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.714
Your silence speaks volumes.

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:10.383
Oh, yeah? What does it seem to be saying?

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:12.552
You don't want me on this case.

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:16.014
More like I'm wondering why
you wanna be on this case.

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:19.476
Good leaders don't solve problems
from their desks.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:23.063
Captains aren't usually out in the field.
And yet time and time again, here you are.

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:30.570
Now, your silence is speaking volumes.

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:33.490
Well, what do you think it's saying?

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.991
It's unclear.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.286
Yeah, that's what worries me.

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:42.499
Padilla's house is immaculate.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:46.294
Every book squared to the edge,
every object in its place.

00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:49.005
A soldier's precision in civilian life.

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.591
If I didn't know better,
I'd have guessed you lived here.

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.636
Let's bag that up when we go.

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:57.555
I'm guessing your view of the military
isn't a very good one, Captain.

00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:01.101
I don't see how an institution built
on hierarchy and obedience

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:03.144
jives with a man who lives in the gray.

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:05.355
Well, you misread that one, Detective.

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:07.607
I respect the military.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.901
The discipline it instills isn't at odds

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:11.903
with knowing when
and how to bend the rules,

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:14.614
especially when someone
on your team is in trouble.

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:24.040
You may be surprised to learn,

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:27.710
the most honest part
of our body is our feet.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:30.421
- That does surprise me.
- Something to say, Ms. Gillory?

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:34.259
Well, yeah, mostly I'm just trying
to pace my attention span.

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:36.261
Are we going to move on anytime soon,

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:38.972
or are we gonna camp out
in the feet world for a bit?

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:42.058
The material here
is of extreme importance.

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:44.394
Okay.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:47.105
For example,
we've all been trained by experience

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:49.816
to hide what we're feeling on our faces.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.860
Well, most of us.

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:56.030
But our feet are hardwired
into our fight-or-flight instincts.

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:58.616
When our ancestors
were being chased by a tiger,

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.954
they didn't have time to craft
a polished response, they just ran.

00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:06.332
So, when someone is comfortable
in a conversation,

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:09.377
their feet are relaxed, facing forward.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.254
But when they are uncomfortable,

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:15.341
when they are lying,
or eager to get out of a conversation,

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:17.510
their feet tell the story.

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:24.851
I have to step out.
My kids' school is calling.

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:27.854
A couple of tardies and suddenly
I'm raising criminals. I'll be right back.

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.189
You'll barely miss me.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:32.150
Okay, let's move on to lips.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.030
She did it again.

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:41.326
Morgan, you can't be calling me.

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:42.535
<i>Yes, I know.</i>

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:44.370
Listen, you have
to question Ethan Wolfe again.

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:45.997
What? Why?

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.666
Chapter two, interview and interrogation.
His feet were all over the place.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.751
<i>I think he's lying.</i>

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:51.836
- Morgan, if you get caught...
- I'm helping you.

00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:56.090
Morgan, we gotta go.

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:57.634
Why? What's going on?

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.190
Stop! LAPD!

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:35.255
What do we know about this guy?

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:38.341
He's an aerospace engineer
for Flagstone Defense Systems.

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:41.302
So, if anybody has the skills
to plan a midair murder...

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:43.429
Daphne sent his picture
over to the clinic at the Air Force

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:44.847
to see if anyone recognized him.

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:47.225
Turns out he was seen arguing
with Padilla a month ago.

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:49.686
- Mmm.
- Now we just need to know why.

00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:58.945
You ready to talk?

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.323
We already got you
on breaking and entering.

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:03.866
And resisting arrest.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.994
But you know what's
a whole lot worse than that?

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:07.537
Go ahead, tell him.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.621
Murder.

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:12.750
Hey, there he is.
Finally got your attention.

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:14.127
Start talking.

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:20.341
My brother Silas was a test pilot
for the Air Force, code name Thunderbird.

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:22.260
He had PTSD pretty bad.

00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:23.886
And a few weeks ago, he, uh...

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:27.432
he wrapped his car
around a telephone pole.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.269
We're sorry for your loss, Ethan.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.147
Padilla was his therapist,

00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:36.816
and he failed him.

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:40.069
I was upset. I was angry.

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:42.655
I let it get the best of me,
and after my brother's funeral,

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:44.824
I went over to his office to confront him.

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.410
Why take a skydiving class with Padilla?

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:50.329
Was it to make sure
he stopped moving on with his life?

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:53.624
How could I... How would I have killed him?
He died midair.

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:56.169
You're the aerospace engineer.
You tell us.

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.254
Tell us why you were at Padilla's house.

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:04.260
I think he's earned a trip
to the holding cell.

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:10.141
Hey, let's get a full workup on this guy.

00:14:10.224 --> 00:14:13.895
Financials, socials,
phone records, anything--

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:15.229
Hold off on that for a second.

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:18.524
Wolfe's too smart to leave anything
in his digital record.

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:20.651
The real dirt is going to be in his house.

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:22.278
Daphne and Oz should head there.

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.947
But we don't have probable cause
to search his home.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.617
I'll get us a warrant within the hour.

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:38.127
You heard him, prep the search.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:50.598
Lieutenant, look,
I see what you're dealing with.

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:53.059
Do I look like I want to
talk about this right now, huh? Do I?

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.814
I'm sorry, all right? I just...

00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:00.608
I will deal with Captain Wagner
in my own way, okay?

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.236
- Understood.
- But Morgan--

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:04.904
- I'll go check on her.
- Yes.

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:07.031
Because if Solomon finds out
that she calls us--

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:09.700
I will make sure that Morgan
is not breaking or bending any rules.

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:11.786
- Please, and thank you.
- Yeah.

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:20.628
- Lieutenant Soto.
- <i>How's Morgan doing?</i>

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.299
She's safe and worried about you.
We found your truck.

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:26.801
<i>What happened?</i>

00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:29.303
Well, the guy tailing me wasn't gonna
let me get to the station,

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:31.430
<i>so I pulled over, I left the truck
and got out of there quick</i>

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:32.890
and dropped off the grid.

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:35.601
All right, well tell me where you are.
I can put you in protective custody.

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:38.604
No, no, no. That ship has sailed.
It's too late for that.

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:39.981
I got my own plans now.

00:15:40.064 --> 00:15:42.316
Arthur, you can't go after him.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.570
Hey, they came after me. Remember? Twice.

00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:47.947
I understand that,
but what if it becomes a third time?

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.367
- Then what the hell are you gonna do?
- No, I don't think you do understand.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.369
<i>See, Roman was like a brother to me.</i>

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:56.080
Now this guy, he must know
something about what happened to him.

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:57.456
<i>And if you find him, then what?</i>

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.294
Oh, I'm gonna get him to talk. Believe me.
It's as simple as that.

00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:05.590
No, simple is you letting me
and my team find out who did this to you.

00:16:05.673 --> 00:16:06.883
I don't need you on my list.

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:09.093
Then don't add me to it.

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:11.429
<i>Arthur.</i>

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:29.906
- Please tell me that's a Reuben.
- It is a Reuben.

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:33.409
Does this Reuben come with
an elaborate plan to get me out of here?

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:35.036
It does not.

00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:36.621
Then what are you doing here?

00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:40.166
I'm just trying to make sure you survive
today, so we can catch bad guys tomorrow.

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:41.542
- That's very sweet.
- Mm-hmm.

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:43.961
Also, you absolutely cannot call us,
Morgan.

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:46.172
Because if Dottie were to see that
and tell Solomon, it would be--

00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:48.257
I knew that's why you were here.
Will you relax, please?

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:50.468
Dottie didn't see anything.

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:54.555
Oh. Dr. Maeve Sloan, the flight surgeon
who runs the mental health department

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:55.890
where Padilla worked, wants to talk.

00:16:55.973 --> 00:16:57.892
Okay, well, text me
if you hear anything interesting.

00:16:57.975 --> 00:16:59.644
Did you not hear a word
I just said 30 seconds ago?

00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:02.271
I heard exactly what I wanted to hear,
and I'm starving.

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:05.066
So, either stay or get out of here.

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:07.610
Eat, and please behave.

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:16.118
Forgot the pickles.

00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:19.580
This is the mental health wing
where Padilla worked.

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:22.708
You said you think you know
who's responsible for his death?

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:26.337
I wouldn't go that far, but if it were me,
I know where I'd be looking.

00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:29.882
Last month,
after Thunderbird died, Silas Wolfe.

00:17:30.424 --> 00:17:32.301
Padilla started acting different.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:34.762
He felt guilty,
like he'd missed something.

00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:36.931
He told me he was worried
the same thing was happening

00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:38.266
with some of his other patients.

00:17:38.349 --> 00:17:40.643
Something other than PTSD? Any idea what?

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:45.189
I'm not sure he ever figured it out,
or even if he was right.

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.900
But he started requesting
medical workups for patients,

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:52.071
grounding pilots, which delayed
deployment of their missions.

00:17:54.365 --> 00:17:58.077
That would have made Padilla enemies.
One bad evaluation could ruin a career.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.996
Yeah. Plus, if the pilots
weren't fit to fly

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:02.081
and the top brass had been told
but ignored it...

00:18:02.164 --> 00:18:04.875
Padilla would be a liability
that they needed to take care of.

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:07.753
Do you know the names of the patients?
Projects they were assigned to?

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:09.755
I don't, but even if I did,

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:13.009
I couldn't violate HIPAA guidelines
without a court order.

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:14.927
Could we maybe look in his office?

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:17.722
Just even his personal effects
might tell us something.

00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:18.848
That I can do.

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:21.183
Like I said, we were close.

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:24.812
That's one mystery solved.

00:18:25.396 --> 00:18:28.816
We found a key card exactly like that in
Padilla's locker at the skydiving school.

00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:31.944
Ah, yes, these things
control our lives around here.

00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:36.866
Parking, getting in the building,
the copier, one card to rule them all.

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:39.160
I'll be next door if you need me.

00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:40.786
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:45.541
Image of perfection, just like his house.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:46.917
Mm-hmm.

00:18:47.001 --> 00:18:49.378
Look at this frame though.
It's weird, right?

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:51.464
It's thicker than it needs to be.

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.447
- Look at the Thunderbird in the corner.
- Yeah.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.575
That was Silas Wolfe's handle.
He was Padilla's patient who died.

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:21.327
So, maybe these pictures at the top,

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.246
touchdown, whiskey,
samurai, ace, are test pilots too.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.499
And possibly Padilla's patients as well.

00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:28.626
Makes sense.
But what is this board trying to tell us?

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:33.005
Huh. If we only had someone good
at puzzles at our disposal.

00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:35.591
Well, we don't. We can't use Morgan.

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:39.095
I'm in the business of catching bad guys,
Detective Karadec. She can help.

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.180
If she gets caught,
she could lose her job, Captain.

00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:43.849
I'm not asking. Text her the board.

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:58.572
Control the scene, preserve the evidence.

00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:01.409
If you fail at either, a killer goes free.

00:20:02.076 --> 00:20:07.331
Our victim, 45, GSW to the chest,
robbery gone wrong.

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:09.083
Not a robbery though.

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:11.752
And why would you say that?

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.963
Well, for starters,

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:16.841
a loading dock is a pretty dumb place
to rob somebody, right?

00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:19.510
There's gonna be a bunch of people
coming in and out. No privacy.

00:20:19.593 --> 00:20:24.056
And then what? I'm gonna steal from
one guy and get maybe a hundred bucks,

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.642
but leave behind a fancy gold chain
that costs more than my car?

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.436
The whole thing just feels staged.

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:32.356
It is staged. Well. It's well done.
But you know what I'm saying.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.858
Anything else?

00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:35.776
Well, all the cigarette butts.

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:39.905
There's like half a pack
of butts over here.

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:43.159
Yeah, let's see.

00:20:45.035 --> 00:20:48.456
So, if somebody's sitting around
smoking cigarettes, waiting for somebody,

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:51.333
that means they didn't jump somebody,
which means it's gotta be personal.

00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:56.630
In our scenario, the victim was having
an affair with the killer's wife.

00:20:56.714 --> 00:20:59.675
- Ooh. Okay.
- Well done.

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:00.926
Thanks.

00:21:02.553 --> 00:21:04.221
Let's talk about how to process a scene.

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:05.931
Secure the perimeter.

00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:10.603
Make sure everyone who
is supposed to be here is logged.

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:15.024 line:20%
Then before you touch a thing, document.
Photos, sketches, notes...

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:32.208
<i>Are you breaking the rules?</i>

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:35.544
Against my better judgment.
You have Captain Wagner, Daphne, and Oz.

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:37.087
<i>Oh, hey, guys. Uh, get me out of here.</i>

00:21:37.171 --> 00:21:39.048
- Hey, Morgan.
- If we could, we would.

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:42.259
Morgan, we think each column is
for one of Padilla's patients,

00:21:42.343 --> 00:21:44.512
<i>but we need help making sense of the rest.</i>

00:21:44.595 --> 00:21:47.932
Okay, well,
the silhouettes are all symbols.

00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:51.894
Anxiety, fatigue, confusion, headaches.

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:54.063
Those are all symptoms of PTSD.

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:55.648
Which is what Thunderbird supposedly had,

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:57.775
but according to Dr. Sloan,
Padilla had his doubts.

00:21:57.858 --> 00:22:01.153
<i>Well, yeah, I can see what he's
talking about. Look at the Post-it notes.</i>

00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:05.157
There's a global color language for danger
so that everybody can understand.

00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:07.910
White is safe, yellow's bad, red's worse.

00:22:10.287 --> 00:22:13.707
Padilla was tracking their symptoms,
but look at the dates.

00:22:13.791 --> 00:22:16.961
All these guys' symptoms started
and progressed around the same time,

00:22:17.044 --> 00:22:19.338
but that's not how PTSD works.

00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:20.798
It hits everyone differently.

00:22:20.881 --> 00:22:25.427
So their symptoms were like PTSD
but caused by something else. What?

00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:27.721
<i>No idea, but whatever it was,</i>

00:22:27.805 --> 00:22:30.766
it's starting to feel a lot like digging
into it is what got Padilla killed.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.726
Mm-hmm. All right, what's next?

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:34.061
Hanging up the phone?

00:22:34.979 --> 00:22:36.063
Yes, absolutely.

00:22:36.146 --> 00:22:37.731
- Can I just fini--
- No.

00:22:37.815 --> 00:22:39.233
Morgan, do what she says.

00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:41.110
Next time, I'll take that.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.529
- Not a child.
- What was that?

00:22:44.697 --> 00:22:46.949
Yes, ma'am. That's what I was saying.

00:22:50.995 --> 00:22:53.998
Exactly what I didn't want to happen.

00:22:54.081 --> 00:22:56.625
We need to find the other test pilots,
let them know they're in danger.

00:22:56.709 --> 00:22:58.335
Yeah, if they're still alive.

00:23:00.421 --> 00:23:04.008
Looks like we missed one.
Cadmus from Greek mythology.

00:23:04.091 --> 00:23:06.594
But why doesn't Cadmus have
its own column?

00:23:06.677 --> 00:23:08.387
Maybe Cadmus isn't a who.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:12.391
It's a what. Because I also see a logo
for Flagstone Defense Systems.

00:23:14.101 --> 00:23:16.145
Guess we're making a visit
to the holding cell.

00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:22.651
Cadmus is the prototype plane
that Flagstone Defense Systems

00:23:22.735 --> 00:23:24.778
is making for the Air Force, isn't it?

00:23:24.862 --> 00:23:27.656
And because of the symptoms
Padilla saw in the test pilots,

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.576
he realized something
was wrong with the plane.

00:23:33.621 --> 00:23:37.458
When I confronted him about Silas,
he told me what he suspected,

00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:38.542
and he asked for my help.

00:23:39.168 --> 00:23:42.129
Because of my clearance, I have
access to the diagnostics on the plane.

00:23:42.212 --> 00:23:43.213
What did you find out?

00:23:43.297 --> 00:23:45.716
There's a problem with
the life-support system.

00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:48.552
There's not enough oxygen
getting to the cockpit.

00:23:49.845 --> 00:23:53.766
Your brother didn't have PTSD.
He had hypoxia.

00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:55.351
What about the other pilots?

00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:57.019
They're still flying the plane.

00:23:59.021 --> 00:24:00.314
I wanted to tell them
what's happening, but...

00:24:00.397 --> 00:24:01.398
You're scared.

00:24:01.482 --> 00:24:02.942
The stakes are huge.

00:24:03.484 --> 00:24:05.694
Life-support system
sounds expensive to fix.

00:24:05.778 --> 00:24:06.987
Billions.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.198
It would delay the schedule.

00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:13.118
Who had the skill set and the motive
to kill Padilla and keep this secret?

00:24:14.328 --> 00:24:16.497
Ramsey Pike, lead engineer.

00:24:17.581 --> 00:24:19.750
When I confronted him
about what I discovered,

00:24:19.833 --> 00:24:24.129
he said we could find the root failure
after product launch.

00:24:24.213 --> 00:24:25.506
And where's the proof?

00:24:25.589 --> 00:24:29.259
I don't know. I-I gave it to Padilla
on a flash drive a few days ago.

00:24:29.843 --> 00:24:32.388
He texted me yesterday,
said it was urgent we meet.

00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:34.932
That's why you were
at his skydiving class.

00:24:35.015 --> 00:24:36.642
He told me about the death threat.

00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:39.812
When he ended up dead,
I went over to the house

00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:41.563
to look for the file,
but I couldn't find it.

00:24:41.647 --> 00:24:47.361
Ethan, we're gonna find those files and
get justice for Padilla and your brother.

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.620
Cadmus is the prototype jet
that Flagstone Defense

00:24:56.704 --> 00:24:58.622
is developing for the Air Force,
isn't that right, Mr. Pike?

00:24:58.706 --> 00:24:59.707
It is.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:02.292
Were you aware that
all of your pilots have been showing

00:25:02.376 --> 00:25:05.671
PTSD-like symptoms,
and one of them, Mr. Pike, is dead?

00:25:05.754 --> 00:25:07.256
Of course I'm aware.

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:09.550
What happened to Thunderbird is tragic,

00:25:09.633 --> 00:25:13.137
but we found no connection
between their symptoms and our plane.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.513
You sure you looked hard enough?

00:25:14.596 --> 00:25:16.223
What is that supposed to mean?

00:25:16.306 --> 00:25:18.851
It means that there's something wrong
with your plane's life-support system,

00:25:18.934 --> 00:25:20.644
and your pilots are slowly suffocating.

00:25:20.728 --> 00:25:22.938
You think we didn't look into that?

00:25:23.022 --> 00:25:26.734
You think I'd put a pilot
in that cockpit if it wasn't safe?

00:25:26.817 --> 00:25:29.069
We think it's a design flaw
that would cost billions to fix.

00:25:29.153 --> 00:25:30.362
Makes it worth hiding.

00:25:30.988 --> 00:25:32.698
Do you have proof of any of this?

00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:34.867
We'd like to see your diagnostics.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:35.951
Good.

00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:39.663
Come back with a warrant,
get through my lawyers, and you can.

00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:41.373
Mr. Pike, where were you this morning?

00:25:41.457 --> 00:25:43.417
I was here. Talk to my team.

00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:46.503
In the meantime, get out of my hangar.

00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:50.966
- I really like that guy a lot.
- Yeah, he's a real charmer.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.802
If you ask me,
Pike knew about the design flaw.

00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:56.013
Padilla had the proof,
and he killed him for it.

00:25:56.096 --> 00:25:57.097
Yeah, well, if you're right about that,

00:25:57.181 --> 00:25:59.141
Padilla did a damn fine job
of hiding that proof.

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:00.851
Where are we with Padilla's computer?

00:26:00.934 --> 00:26:03.437
It's still backed up with TID.
Could take a while.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:17.576
The LAPD formed
the first American crime unit in 1968.

00:26:17.659 --> 00:26:19.119
Then in '86,

00:26:19.203 --> 00:26:21.705
the commissioner reorganized the workflow

00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:25.000
by moving missing persons
under the umbrella of--

00:26:27.086 --> 00:26:28.796
Ms. Gillory, you have a question?

00:26:28.879 --> 00:26:30.756
Well, it's actually more of a confession.

00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:34.885
I am just now realizing
how all of these departments

00:26:34.968 --> 00:26:37.554
really make up
the beating heart of the LAPD.

00:26:37.638 --> 00:26:41.058
Take, I don't know, TID for example.

00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:43.018
I-I feel like we all take it for granted.

00:26:43.102 --> 00:26:46.939
I agree. Digital evidence is
the core of detective work.

00:26:47.022 --> 00:26:50.025
- Chain of custody, encryption, all of it.
- Yeah, all of it.

00:26:50.109 --> 00:26:53.112
And I feel like it would really
help us appreciate what they do

00:26:53.195 --> 00:26:56.281
if we were to see 'em in action, you know,
rather than just hearing about it.

00:26:57.574 --> 00:26:59.743
You know what? That's a fine idea.

00:27:00.327 --> 00:27:03.122
I think a little field trip is in order.

00:27:03.205 --> 00:27:05.165
Oh. Good idea.

00:27:08.043 --> 00:27:10.629
TID handles everything digital.

00:27:10.712 --> 00:27:14.842
Phones, laptops, cloud storage,
surveillance footage,

00:27:14.925 --> 00:27:17.052
if it's got a hard drive,
it comes through this room.

00:27:17.136 --> 00:27:21.181
Now, chain of custody is key...

00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:25.102
Hello.

00:27:25.185 --> 00:27:26.728
Hey, it's me.

00:27:26.812 --> 00:27:28.814
Morgan, where are you calling me from?

00:27:29.523 --> 00:27:30.524
Wait, let me guess.

00:27:30.607 --> 00:27:31.859
TID?

00:27:32.401 --> 00:27:34.111
I wasn't supposed to use my phone.

00:27:34.194 --> 00:27:37.155
- You're not supposed to use any phone.
- Okay, well, that wasn't made clear.

00:27:37.239 --> 00:27:39.449
Guess what?
I got the password for Padilla's computer.

00:27:39.533 --> 00:27:40.951
What? From where?

00:27:41.034 --> 00:27:43.495
A really sweet TID guy. His name's Lyle.
Do you know him?

00:27:44.788 --> 00:27:46.331
<i>Never mind. So before he died,</i>

00:27:46.415 --> 00:27:48.375
Padilla sent something
to his office printer.

00:27:48.458 --> 00:27:49.459
It's still in the queue.

00:27:50.794 --> 00:27:52.129
Padilla's key card.

00:27:52.212 --> 00:27:53.630
<i>All right, thanks.</i>

00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:13.150
- Yeah?
- Morgan, we got him.

00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:15.861
All the diagnostics on Cadmus
showing the design flaw.

00:28:15.944 --> 00:28:18.071
Padilla got his hands on the proof.
Pike knew.

00:28:18.155 --> 00:28:20.574
No way. That's amazing.

00:28:22.618 --> 00:28:24.369
You have the wrong num--

00:28:24.453 --> 00:28:27.331
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep.

00:28:28.165 --> 00:28:29.166
Sorry.

00:28:43.472 --> 00:28:45.557
Dottie's summation.

00:28:45.641 --> 00:28:46.892
Oh, good.

00:28:46.975 --> 00:28:50.687
"Miss Gillory presents
a litany of unique challenges.

00:28:50.771 --> 00:28:56.443
Disruptive, chaotic, difficult, stubborn,
a one-woman hurricane

00:28:56.526 --> 00:28:59.446
who manages to stand
in the eye of the storm,

00:28:59.529 --> 00:29:03.075
who has an affinity for knowing
when and how to break the rules.

00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:06.244
But she demonstrates an ability

00:29:06.328 --> 00:29:09.247
to connect with cases in ways
conventional detectives cannot.

00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:12.626
With proper supervision,
she can be wielded to great effect."

00:29:12.709 --> 00:29:14.086
Dottie.

00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:17.089
See? I knew she secretly liked me.

00:29:17.172 --> 00:29:18.173
It's a big secret, but--

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:22.469
Her recommendation is that we retain
your services as a consultant

00:29:22.552 --> 00:29:26.223
for Major Crimes with continued
training and close supervision.

00:29:26.306 --> 00:29:30.268
Ugh. Really? Okay, fine.
Agreed. Sounds good.

00:29:30.352 --> 00:29:32.646
Can I get back to my team?
'Cause we got work to do.

00:29:32.729 --> 00:29:33.939
No.

00:29:34.564 --> 00:29:37.442
Because I'm not taking her recommendation.

00:29:37.526 --> 00:29:40.445
Your insubordination
isn't a quirk, Morgan,

00:29:40.529 --> 00:29:42.364
it's a liability, and it's a shame.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:45.200
Official paperwork
will go through tomorrow.

00:29:46.994 --> 00:29:50.706
What paper-- Am I being fired?

00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:52.040
Absolutely.

00:30:01.174 --> 00:30:03.844
Life-support systems were indeed
giving the test pilots hypoxia.

00:30:03.927 --> 00:30:06.847
It's right here in black and
white. Pike knew about the malfunction.

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:09.933
He scrubbed the information from
the reports he sent the Air Force,

00:30:10.017 --> 00:30:11.351
so no one in command knew.

00:30:11.435 --> 00:30:14.312
The good news is JAG
terminated his contract

00:30:14.396 --> 00:30:16.189
and has opened a full investigation.

00:30:16.982 --> 00:30:18.400
So those test pilots are safe.

00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:21.570
Yes, but Padilla had to die for it.

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:22.654
And Pike had an alibi.

00:30:22.738 --> 00:30:25.240
So we still can't prove he killed Padilla.

00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:26.408
Or how.

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:29.578
We better find what we're missing or
this guy's gonna get away with murder.

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:32.080
Wouldn't mind having
Morgan here right now.

00:30:45.886 --> 00:30:47.471
I assume you heard about Morgan.

00:30:47.971 --> 00:30:49.014
I did.

00:30:50.807 --> 00:30:53.060
She shouldn't have been working this case.

00:30:54.394 --> 00:30:58.774
Lieutenant, I'm not gonna apologize
for using a valuable asset

00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:01.485
who was aware of the risks
and helped anyway.

00:31:01.568 --> 00:31:02.819
Wow.

00:31:03.612 --> 00:31:04.863
You're a piece of work.

00:31:05.781 --> 00:31:08.116
Please, don't stop.
Seems like you have a lot more to say.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.786
- I promise you don't want to hear it.
- Don't worry about me.

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:12.621
Go ahead.

00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:19.211
You take over my office.

00:31:19.753 --> 00:31:21.588
You barge into my cases.

00:31:21.671 --> 00:31:23.882
You undercut me in front of my team.

00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:28.720
You keep finding all these new ways
to lord your position over mine,

00:31:28.804 --> 00:31:31.765
a position that, by the way, I actually

00:31:31.848 --> 00:31:35.519
more than earned,
and I sat here and I took it

00:31:35.602 --> 00:31:37.604
because I thought
I was doing the right thing.

00:31:38.396 --> 00:31:40.982
I was so wrong.
I should have told you this before.

00:31:41.691 --> 00:31:45.445
Because now the moves that you're making
are affecting my team.

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:47.823
You knew it.

00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:52.619
Morgan was on thin ice, and instead of
protecting her, you hand her a stone.

00:31:54.246 --> 00:31:56.331
From now on,
as long as I sit in that chair,

00:31:56.414 --> 00:32:00.377
you will treat me and my team
with the respect that we deserve.

00:32:02.295 --> 00:32:05.132
If that doesn't work for you,
fire my ass too.

00:32:08.343 --> 00:32:09.594
Understood.

00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:27.904
All right. [sighs] What do we got?

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.365
We're taking the evidence from the top.

00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:33.243
Padilla was fine before takeoff,
and he was fine in the air.

00:32:33.326 --> 00:32:37.164
So what changed between gearing up
and making that jump

00:32:37.247 --> 00:32:40.083
when every single piece of equipment
was checked and working perfectly?

00:32:40.167 --> 00:32:43.795
In other words,
how did Pike commit a murder midair?

00:32:43.879 --> 00:32:44.880
Morgan.

00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:46.590
Wasn't expecting to see you here.

00:32:46.673 --> 00:32:48.383
What do you mean? You're here, I'm here.

00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:50.552
Morgan, you can't work the case.

00:32:52.304 --> 00:32:55.015
- Is this 'cause I got "fired"?
- Yes.

00:32:55.098 --> 00:32:58.143
You guys, come on.
You don't think this is gonna blow over?

00:33:00.228 --> 00:33:01.563
That's crazy.

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:03.940
I'm valuable here. Dottie saw it.

00:33:04.024 --> 00:33:05.859
Solomon put in the paperwork.

00:33:05.942 --> 00:33:08.904
Well, we all know that could take
weeks if not months to process.

00:33:08.987 --> 00:33:13.033
- More like hours.
- Okay, then we call the union, right?

00:33:13.116 --> 00:33:14.367
File an appeal.

00:33:14.451 --> 00:33:16.036
Morgan, there's no appeal.

00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:18.538
I'm really sorry it worked out like this.

00:33:20.916 --> 00:33:21.958
Oh.

00:33:23.126 --> 00:33:24.211
Wow.

00:33:24.878 --> 00:33:25.879
Okay.

00:33:28.798 --> 00:33:33.094
Silver lining, I lasted a lot longer
than anybody thought I would, right?

00:33:34.846 --> 00:33:36.723
Including myself.

00:33:39.226 --> 00:33:41.561
This is on me. I should've
kept you out of the investigation.

00:33:41.645 --> 00:33:44.648
Stop it.
You think you could have done that?

00:33:46.191 --> 00:33:47.192
It's okay.

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:51.529
It's okay. I'm okay.

00:33:56.076 --> 00:34:00.038
In fact, did you know that
if you file something after 6:00 p.m.,

00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:01.706
it doesn't get processed
until the next day?

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:05.961
So, technically, I am still on the books
until tomorrow morning.

00:34:08.213 --> 00:34:10.507
See? I did pay attention
in detective school.

00:34:11.299 --> 00:34:14.386
- You talking an all-nighter?
- I love an all-nighter.

00:34:17.138 --> 00:34:18.390
Let's get to work.

00:34:19.516 --> 00:34:21.309
Morgan, a word.

00:34:27.607 --> 00:34:29.609
You should know I heard from Arthur.

00:34:29.693 --> 00:34:30.694
He's safe.

00:34:31.278 --> 00:34:32.654
But he still won't come in.

00:34:33.822 --> 00:34:35.907
I don't expect you
to keep going with this.

00:34:35.991 --> 00:34:37.909
The Roman situation has gotten
really dangerous, and I--

00:34:37.993 --> 00:34:39.703
And that's what I signed up for.

00:34:41.955 --> 00:34:42.998
We're good.

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:52.507
Philip, you gotta make them
get you the real stuff.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.592
That knockoff cleaner isn't gonna cut it.

00:34:58.972 --> 00:35:00.807
<i>Your pilots are slowly suffocating.</i>

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:02.767
There's a problem with
the life-support system.

00:35:02.851 --> 00:35:05.020
<i>Padilla got his hands
on the proof. Pike knew.</i>

00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:06.479
"I know what you're doing. Stop or die."

00:35:06.563 --> 00:35:08.648
<i>His helmet and oxygen mask
were working properly.</i>

00:35:12.235 --> 00:35:15.822
Who am I calling? The morgue?
The evidence locker? The Air Force?

00:35:15.905 --> 00:35:17.115
The lab.

00:35:20.035 --> 00:35:21.036
I figured it out.

00:35:30.879 --> 00:35:33.173
Come to see me suffer up close?

00:35:33.256 --> 00:35:34.924
No, that's just a perk.

00:35:35.008 --> 00:35:37.677
Well, my company was everything,
and now it's gone.

00:35:37.761 --> 00:35:40.722
- I have nothing left to lose.
- What about your freedom, sir?

00:35:40.805 --> 00:35:43.308
Because we can prove
you killed Alonso Padilla.

00:35:44.017 --> 00:35:47.187
The sudden onslaught of PTSD-like symptoms
in the death of Silas Wolfe

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:49.189
tipped Padilla off that there was
something wrong

00:35:49.272 --> 00:35:51.191
<i>with all the pilots attached to Cadmus.</i>

00:35:51.274 --> 00:35:54.736
So he started searching for answers,
causing a stir, requesting medical tests.

00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:57.072
And you were the lead engineer on Cadmus.

00:35:57.155 --> 00:36:00.116
Somebody starts poking around,
ordering labs on your pilots,

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.201
I'd be nervous too.

00:36:01.284 --> 00:36:04.245
So you started following him,
asking questions about him,

00:36:04.329 --> 00:36:06.331
learning your enemy
to figure out how to take him down.

00:36:06.414 --> 00:36:09.501
And you did find a way,
because when it came to skydiving,

00:36:09.584 --> 00:36:10.919
<i>Padilla wasn't a weekend thrill seeker.</i>

00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:12.879
He was ex-special recon.

00:36:12.962 --> 00:36:16.049
That means HALO jumps,
which require high-altitude gear.

00:36:16.132 --> 00:36:19.427
Specifically, an oxygen mask,
which is what you used to kill him.

00:36:19.511 --> 00:36:23.139
<i>See, an oxygen mask and tank
are a mini life-support system.</i>

00:36:23.223 --> 00:36:25.809
<i>The tank feeds
pressurized air into the mask.</i>

00:36:25.892 --> 00:36:29.938
<i>And when you exhale, the carbon dioxide
is released through the exhalation valve.</i>

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:32.482
But if you put a valve in there
made from materials that

00:36:32.565 --> 00:36:36.319
cannot handle extreme temperatures,
where's that carbon dioxide gonna go?

00:36:38.363 --> 00:36:41.116
- That's what happened to Padilla's mask.
- Our labs confirmed it.

00:36:41.199 --> 00:36:43.284
<i>His valve was made with
a different material than his students.</i>

00:36:43.368 --> 00:36:45.954
<i>Yeah, it was an off-brand
that had been known to freeze</i>

00:36:46.037 --> 00:36:47.997
<i>during high-altitude jumps.</i>

00:36:48.081 --> 00:36:51.376
And unless somebody had a reason, no one
would have tested what it was made of.

00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:54.087
<i>Ninety seconds after
he jumped, disorientation kicked in.</i>

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:58.967
His lungs filled with CO2. He blacked out.
Then eventually died midair.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:03.388
We knew he suffocated, but his
exact cause of death was hypercapnia,

00:37:03.471 --> 00:37:05.849
an excess of carbon dioxide in the blood.

00:37:05.932 --> 00:37:08.852
I've never met Padilla.
Where are you getting this?

00:37:08.935 --> 00:37:11.563
With Air Force's help,
we've got satellite footage of you

00:37:11.646 --> 00:37:15.483
breaking into the skydiving facility
the night before Padilla was murdered.

00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:17.527
Yeah. You gotta put that hood up.

00:37:18.153 --> 00:37:20.989
Ramsey Pike, you're under arrest
for the murder of Alonso Padilla.

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:23.867
Turn around. Hands, sir.

00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:38.298
You wanted a word?

00:37:47.265 --> 00:37:48.975
It's not an apology.

00:37:49.058 --> 00:37:50.518
I stand by what I said.

00:37:52.395 --> 00:37:53.855
I respect that.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.700
You wanted to be in the loop?

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:08.369
Now you're in the loop.

00:38:11.456 --> 00:38:12.999
When did you get these?

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:15.043
Does it matter?

00:38:17.754 --> 00:38:20.507
Solomon went after one of our own.

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:23.051
And you're doing what you
have to do to protect them.

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:25.303
Now and always.

00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:28.556
No matter where the danger's coming from.

00:38:32.268 --> 00:38:33.895
I trust I have your support?

00:38:41.444 --> 00:38:42.862
You do.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.787
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:39:03.049 --> 00:39:05.802
I think I figured out
what your silence is trying to say.

00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:08.346
- Can't wait to hear this.
- Hmm.

00:39:09.806 --> 00:39:11.307
See, a guy like you doesn't take a job

00:39:11.391 --> 00:39:13.726
he knows will keep him
from the thing he loves.

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:15.061
Being in the field.

00:39:16.104 --> 00:39:18.231
Unless, of course, someone forced you.

00:39:19.941 --> 00:39:24.070
So I have to ask, who's the one person
Nick Wagner is too scared to cross?

00:39:25.947 --> 00:39:26.948
Hmm.

00:39:28.241 --> 00:39:29.993
Have a good night, Captain.

00:39:39.961 --> 00:39:42.255
Whatever you have to say,
you're wasting your breath.

00:39:42.755 --> 00:39:44.632
You mind if I say it anyway?

00:39:49.512 --> 00:39:51.222
Morgan just helped us save the lives

00:39:51.306 --> 00:39:54.934
of four decorated servicemen
and got justice for another.

00:39:55.602 --> 00:39:58.229
She can go too far sometimes.
I'm not even denying that.

00:39:58.313 --> 00:40:01.983
But that kind of dedication
and those kind of results...

00:40:04.485 --> 00:40:06.112
don't they count for something?

00:40:07.447 --> 00:40:10.491
They don't count for enough.
I'm sorry. The decision stands.

00:40:12.201 --> 00:40:13.745
Like I said, I had to try.

00:40:27.967 --> 00:40:31.012
Does the chief know that you
and his wife are such close friends?

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.474
Is this really how you want to play this?

00:40:35.308 --> 00:40:36.517
You?

00:40:37.101 --> 00:40:39.479
Yes, it is.

00:41:08.091 --> 00:41:11.719
- Hi. Come in.
- Thank you.

00:41:13.054 --> 00:41:15.056
Your doorbell though, Morgan, what's up?

00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:16.474
It's still broken.

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:19.143
Where is everybody?

00:41:19.227 --> 00:41:21.062
Sleepover at Ludo's.

00:41:21.813 --> 00:41:24.357
Just making banana splits
'cause I'm feeling sorry for myself.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.525
You want one?

00:41:25.608 --> 00:41:27.193
Yes, I do.

00:41:28.528 --> 00:41:31.447
So what is this?
You here to discuss my severance package?

00:41:31.531 --> 00:41:33.574
You're not getting a severance package.

00:41:35.535 --> 00:41:37.286
Because you're not going anywhere.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.082
Solomon's had a change of heart.

00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:42.291
Really?

00:41:42.375 --> 00:41:44.961
- Why?
- I don't know. Just worked out that way.

00:41:46.587 --> 00:41:49.340
Things like this don't just work out
that way. What do you mean?

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:53.052
- What's going on? I'm confused.
- Morgan, take the win.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:54.846
Let it go.

00:41:55.805 --> 00:41:57.015
Did you do something?

00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:02.437
What did you do?

00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:07.191
Nothing that you wouldn't do for me.

00:42:14.866 --> 00:42:15.867
That's good.
