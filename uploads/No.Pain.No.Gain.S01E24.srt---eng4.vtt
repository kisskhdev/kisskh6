=Episode 24=
(This story is purely fictional.)

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.140
(Six Months Earlier)

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.930
I've already written my will.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.930
If you four

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.380
want to take over Jinghong,

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.570
you must...

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.380
Must understand...

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.500
Understand clearly

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.450
about Tengda...

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.380
Daddy.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.380
Doctor.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.220
Dad.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.500
Please don't rush.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.500
Take it slow.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.610
Let me say a few words
after you're done.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.850
You must manage...

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.850
Tengda...

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.170
Tengda...

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.690
is the key to bringing Jinghong back...

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.940
from the brink.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.410
Daddy.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.940
Daddy.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.220
No!

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.340
Dad!

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.660
The old man is still breathing.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.750
You're all a bit too eager, aren't you?

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.040
(Now)

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.420
(Outpatient Clinic)

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.540
Mr. Sima,

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.100
my hand is almost healed.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.660
How long are you
planning to keep sleeping?

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.220
How about this?

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.450
Let me tell you a story.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.850
Once upon a time,

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.380
there was an ordinary man

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.690
who boarded a private jet.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.410
On that plane was a tycoon.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.380
The tycoon told him

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.540
to set up a company.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.660
As long as his projects lost money,
he would make a profit.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.660
But if they made money,

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.660
then each month

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.290
he could only take five thousand.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.700
In the end, every project he did

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.930
turned a profit.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.370
So he could only
take five thousand a month...

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.980
So we finally meet.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.460
Mr. Pei.

00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:44.490
My father has mentioned you
often these past two years.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.340
He told us

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.610
that you are, in his heart,

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.980
the ideal successor

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.370
in the way one ought to be.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.980
Wait.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.410
I should know your name.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.170
Four, three, two...

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.490
Sima

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:59.460
Wan?

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.780
As expected of Mr. Pei.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.540
You're quick to catch on.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.170
No wonder my father

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.900
values you the most.

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:16.140
He always talks about
how outstanding you are.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.050
He also says that today's Tengda

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.930
is exactly what he once imagined

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.460
Jinghong should have become.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.980
What are you getting at?

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.050
Can you just speak plainly?

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.660
Once upon a time,

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.730
there was a young man

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.580
who boarded a private jet.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.610
On that plane was a tycoon.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.140
The tycoon told him

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.930
to set up a company.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.290
When you run projects,

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.610
as long as they lose money,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.050
you get rewarded.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.730
But if you make money,

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:46.980
each month,

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.610
you can only take five thousand.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.050
Hold on.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.410
This...

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.810
This contract

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:57.850
was confidential.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:58.968
How do you know about it?

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.850
There were plenty

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.100
of contracts like this

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.930
on his plane.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.490
Have you ever thought about

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.730
why that plane

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.980
is always waiting there?

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.290
Because every time you get off,

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.700
someone else gets on.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:21.980
I've studied you.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:23.850
To ensure losses,

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.290
when running projects,

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.730
you exhausted every option to add costs,

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.250
finding unconventional paths.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.050
And that

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.490
became innovation.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.850
In order to raise costs,

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.168
you treated your employees well,

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.850
and instead made those people

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.610
willing to give even more

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.610
for a boss like you.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.700
The path Tengda took

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.730
made my father see hope.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.610
In his eyes, Jinghong

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.980
had already decayed beyond saving.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.410
And Tengda

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.610
became his chance at renewal.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.980
Now I finally understand.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.810
All these years,

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.050
I was just a lab rat
raised by the Sima family,

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.140
and Tengda was nothing
more than a test field.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.290
Tengda succeeded,

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.050
and so did my father's experiment.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.140
Your employees

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.610
seem to be living quite happily.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:30.490
But what about you?

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.780
Earning only five thousand
a month at Tengda,

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.370
still burdened by a mortgage,

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.730
and taking on side jobs

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.490
like being a designated driver.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.290
In the end,

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.290
the only one who lost out
was you, Mr. Pei.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.850
Look at yourself now.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.410
Do you still want to keep going?

00:07:53.524 --> 00:07:55.050
What are you really trying to say?

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.370
In my father's eyes,

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.980
you are no different from his sons.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.490
Whoever crosses the finish line

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.370
is the winning horse.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.610
My foolish younger brothers

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.340
actually thought they could inherit it!

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.580
What they didn't realize was

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.170
that we weren't even candidates.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.410
So you also want to take over Tengda?

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:27.410
Mr. Pei,

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.490
as for me,

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.300
I saw through it long ago.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.490
I want Tengda

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.610
to declare bankruptcy.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.610
So what you are saying is,

00:08:44.768 --> 00:08:46.250
you want revenge on your father?

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.300
I want him to see

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.420
that he and all his experiments

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.650
were completely wrong!

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.010
So,

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.490
Tengda's collapse

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.980
must be carried out by you.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.100
Why should I listen to you?

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:06.890
Besides,

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:08.460
this is your family's business.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.940
Do not drag Tengda into it.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.220
No.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.250
Mr. Pei, did you forget?

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.250
Tengda is our family's company.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.650
My offer

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.010
is far more reasonable

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:32.820
than what my father gave you.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.460
After all,

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.490
it's about getting what we each want

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.460
and benefiting both sides.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.610
My request is simple.

00:09:44.035 --> 00:09:45.940
Right now, Tengda
is nearly drained dry

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.370
by my younger brothers.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.400
Now your agreement with my father

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.060
cannot be fulfilled.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.460
Mr. Pei,

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.730
end all of this.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.460
Have you not always

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.010
wanted to be free of it, too?

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.650
I am just

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.610
giving you a push.

00:10:04.013 --> 00:10:05.980
As long as Tengda
declares bankruptcy at once,

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.940
all the money in it

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.130
will be yours.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.100
After all these hard years,

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.370
it is time

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.700
to think about yourself.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.770
When Tengda declares bankruptcy,

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:26.850
whatever money is left...

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.370
I will transfer it
to your account at once.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.370
Then,

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.580
you will be completely free.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.220
(One Month Later)

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:08.980
There seems to be a bug here.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.235
I will send it to Yada later.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:11.610
Lin Wan.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.610
I gave all those orders

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:14.730
to Liu.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:15.850
Okay.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.850
Yada, there are quite
a few bugs in this.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:18.770
Later...

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:19.370
Okay.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:20.100
Wei.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:20.730
Look.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:21.490
It is wrong, right?

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.580
Where is the pen?

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.100
Did you send it?

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:27.850
You did, right?

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:28.850
I have seen it.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:29.980
I saw it. Give me a moment.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.850
Huang. Come here. I need to talk to you.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.370
- Mr. Ma, just a second.
- Um, I...

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:08.940
Qian.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.100
You are back.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.449
Why did you not tell us in advance?

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:12.560
We could have picked you up.

00:12:12.568 --> 00:12:13.340
Mr. Pei is back!

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.250
Mr. Pei.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:14.850
Quickly.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:15.460
Mr. Pei.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:16.370
Mr. Pei is back.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.610
Mr. Pei, you're finally back!

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.568
Have you fully recovered?

00:12:18.568 --> 00:12:19.850
You should have rested longer.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.580
Mr. Pei.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.370
You look exhausted.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:23.490
You shouldn't have come in.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:24.730
You should be resting at home.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:25.850
Exactly.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.700
You care far too much about work.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.940
While you were away,

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:29.890
all departments

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:30.890
have returned to normal.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:31.460
Yes.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.220
Mr. Pei. No need to worry
about the company.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.490
Everything is running well.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.490
We have all
taken good care of ourselves.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.530
It is your health that worries us.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.213
Exactly, Mr. Pei.
We have started working on

00:12:40.213 --> 00:12:41.850
the Divine Mountains
and Seas version 2.0.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:42.590
Impressive, right?

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:43.370
Look at you, huh?

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.210
Why show off something
that is not even finished?

00:12:45.213 --> 00:12:46.370
Mr. Pei, do not worry.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:47.820
The mess those Simas left behind

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.460
can be handled by us.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.850
We have taken very good care
of the company.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:53.010
The highest level of management

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.213
is governed by noninterference.

00:12:54.213 --> 00:12:54.700
Exactly.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.370
Could this be a setup

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:58.730
Mr. Pei planned for us?

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:00.700
Mr. Pei.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.924
You can be completely at ease.

00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:03.580
Go home and rest properly.

00:13:03.968 --> 00:13:05.324
Focus on recovery.

00:13:05.324 --> 00:13:07.850
Once you are better, there is no need
to rush back to the company.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.100
Didn't you enjoy
doing rideshare driving? Go do that.

00:13:10.102 --> 00:13:10.890
Experiencing life.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:11.220
Exactly.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.180
I am telling you...

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.850
Huang, perfect timing.
I need to talk to you.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:16.100
You go rest for a bit.
Sit in the office for a while.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.035
I will find you later.

00:13:17.057 --> 00:13:17.730
Huang, come here.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:18.700
I need to speak with you.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.460
Come on.

00:13:19.991 --> 00:13:21.180
Huang, come over here.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:21.940
Come talk to me.

00:13:22.102 --> 00:13:23.730
No. I still need to see Hao Qiong later.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.060
I just wanted to tell you this.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.180
I want you to accept my investment.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.770
Start a company.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.490
You provide the startup capital,

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:06.730
and I set up the company?

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:07.770
If it succeeds,

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:08.850
I get nothing.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.610
If it loses money, you pay me instead?

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.580
(The arrangement is simple.)

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.100
(The greater the losses
the company makes,)

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.130
(the more you personally gain.)

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.250
What exactly do you want?

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:20.890
When Tengda makes money,

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.490
you are happy too, aren't you?

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.490
So why insist that I run it into losses?

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:28.370
(I have studied you.)

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.250
(To create losses,)

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:31.770
(when running projects,)

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.100
(you exhaust every option
to raise costs,)

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:35.770
finding unconventional ways.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.580
That, instead,

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:39.010
became innovation.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.370
To add costs,

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.370
you treat employees well.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.370
And that makes them

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.100
willing to give more

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.100
for a boss like you.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.610
(Do you really think
he was doing charity?)

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.490
(He is afraid that as he grows old,)

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.370
(Jinghong will be swept away
by the tide of the times.)

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.890
(He just wanted to find someone)

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.980
(to help him extend his capital empire.)

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:02.850
Ms. Xin,

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.370
tell me, why did Mr. Sima

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.250
have to choose me?

00:15:08.613 --> 00:15:09.991
(Have you ever thought about)

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.730
(why that plane)

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.220
(is always waiting there?)

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.890
(Because every time you get off,)

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.850
(someone else gets on.)

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.980
In my father's eyes,

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.100
whoever crosses the finish line

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.890
is the good horse.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.610
Since you chose to start with games,

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:28.610
well...

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.700
I wish you success in

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.220
losing your way to the top.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.890
(Even my father never expected)

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:35.890
(that you would
actually build Tengda up.)

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.580
(The industries involved)

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.100
(kept expanding.)

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.340
(Honestly...)

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.220
Besides games,

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.890
there are many other fields.

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.770
Just because games
are not going smoothly

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.460
does not mean others will not.

00:15:48.524 --> 00:15:49.770
(Once an experiment succeeds,)

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.770
(there will be another one.)

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:53.180
(Behind you,)

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.770
(his hand will always be there.)

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.250
And we will always

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.460
remain on this chessboard.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.010
(Mr. Sima,)

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.010
(can you let me)

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:03.940
return to Tengda?

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:07.340
Mr. Pei,

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.890
since we are all
just pieces being moved,

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.340
why not

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.010
flip the chessboard together?

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.250
So after you got off that plane,

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.370
someone else boarded it.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:31.370
All that talk
about losing more to gain more,

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.100
yet in the end, you gained nothing.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.130
You even lost your own life to it.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.370
Is that still a life?

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.060
In the Sima family's eyes,

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:40.770
all of this is just their assets.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.791
- Sima Wan is right.
- Sima Wan is right.

00:16:43.835 --> 00:16:45.102
- Why don't we
- Why don't we

00:16:45.102 --> 00:16:47.124
- flip this board over?
- flip this board over?

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.490
Take care.

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:12.090
Mr. Pei.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:13.290
You know,

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:15.570
I usually do not work at this hour.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.180
Ms. Xin.

00:17:19.991 --> 00:17:22.768
All these years, there's been something
I have always wanted to ask you.

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:25.770
Why did Mr. Sima choose me?

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.570
It seems

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:32.770
Sima Wan has already talked to you.

00:17:36.724 --> 00:17:38.620
They called it
a confidentiality agreement,

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.860
yet it only kept things secret from me.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.380
The Sima family's affairs
are not for me to comment on.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:48.380
That is true.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.191
The information on you
and the other candidates

00:17:50.213 --> 00:17:51.213
was all gathered by me,

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.050
but the one who chose you

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.010
was him.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.860
In fact, no one really knows

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:11.900
what Mr. Sima is thinking.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.770
He may have felt that you were more like

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.730
an ordinary person,

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.460
unlike those

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.460
who only wanted to secure

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.090
his investment.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:20.700
You think quickly,

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.980
you dare to challenge authority,

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.330
and in the Fuhui Job-Security
Survival Manual,

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.620
you pointed out many problems

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.090
that truly existed at Fuhui.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.700
Ms. Xin,

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:31.700
I feel that...

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.380
I am slowly

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.220
becoming less and less like
the person you described.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.250
I cannot keep going anymore.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.620
Given Mr. Sima's current situation,

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.250
whatever you decide to do,
I cannot stop you.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.380
And,

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.050
from a personal standpoint,

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:07.940
you truly should
start thinking about yourself.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:35.700
(Drop your worries,
make life a little sweeter)

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.220
(Sima Wan)

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:18.700
Hello.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:19.810
It is me.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.050
Mr. Pei,

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.050
it seems we can talk

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:25.090
about our plan now.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.500
(Shenhua International)

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.290
Why do I feel hungry again
right after eating?

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:41.940
I kind of feel like having some coffee.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.330
Yeah, I want coffee too.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.380
What do you want? Americano?

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.730
I want an iced Americano.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.480
Alright.
I will order for everyone in a bit.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:52.250
Let me tell you something.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.330
These people only know
how to laugh. Nothing else.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:54.860
Exactly.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.940
No matter their language skills,
all they do is laugh.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:58.380
Right?

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.902
Do you think I might actually
have real talent as a screenwriter?

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:02.620
Lu Zhiyao said what I wrote was good.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:03.570
You should be careful.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:04.180
Seriously.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:04.620
Listen...

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.530
It's really my passion.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.750
I can really make a story
full of twists and turns.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.700
And who else mentioned Lu Zhiyao?

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:11.050
Lu Zhiyao told you that?

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:11.860
Yes.

00:21:12.213 --> 00:21:14.050
What kind of literary level
does he even have?

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.330
I will take everyone on a trip.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:36.770
A trip?

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.620
Let me say a few words.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:47.940
Let me say a few words.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.050
Maybe I really am talented.

00:21:50.257 --> 00:21:51.860
Alright then. What do you want to eat?

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:53.770
Let me say a few words.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:56.591
Mr. Pei wants to say a few words.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:57.924
When did Mr. Pei come in?

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:04.660
From the day Tengda
was founded until now,

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.380
I never once imagined

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.730
that Tengda would grow
into a company of this scale.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.810
At the very beginning,

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.960
I only wanted to make something
like The Lonely Road.

00:22:11.991 --> 00:22:13.280
The Lonely Road was amazing.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.010
Back then,
I played it for days straight,

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:16.180
and it changed how I saw life.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:18.530
When I was at Sky Fire,
everyone played it.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.940
Exactly.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.050
Then, later came M&Y Internet Cafe,

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:27.330
Feihuang Pictures,

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:28.570
and Sloth Gym.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:30.490
I never expected

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.660
that everyone...

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.010
M&Y Internet Cafe was
the work of the two of us,

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.290
plus Zhang Yuan and Chen Lei.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:35.620
It was the result of all our efforts.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.860
When I was still in school, I...

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.380
Mr. Pei.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:38.050
Mr. Pei.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.290
Feihuang Pictures has not wrapped yet.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:41.250
Almost.

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:45.530
Anyway,

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:50.220
for personal reasons,

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.420
and everything
I have been through recently,

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.140
I have decided to shut down
all of Tengda's businesses.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:01.660
As for everyone here,

00:23:02.502 --> 00:23:04.250
I will also make arrangements for you.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.700
Really. There are still
two fairies in my script.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.057
Seriously, you two can play them.

00:23:09.746 --> 00:23:11.050
I will get everything back for you.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:11.940
When the time comes,

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.090
we can mark it
as the former site of Bao Xu.

00:23:15.613 --> 00:23:17.090
There really should be a sign.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:19.140
One that says "Former Site of Bao Xu."

00:23:19.168 --> 00:23:20.860
Just do not turn it
into a historical ruin.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.570
You should definitely
go check it out, Lv.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:26.010
Calm down.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:29.860
Mr. Pei seems a bit off today.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.090
Something does not feel right.

00:23:33.013 --> 00:23:34.250
What do you mean, not right?

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:35.768
Didn't he just say he wanted to...

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.090
Did I mishear that just now?

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.180
You did not mishear.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.770
He really meant to shut Tengda...

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:42.940
down?

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:49.330
Wei.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.660
Wei, what is going on?

00:23:50.791 --> 00:23:51.810
What happened to Mr. Pei?

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.050
It is fine.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:53.620
Well,

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:55.810
it is nothing.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:57.570
Let's end things here for today.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:23:59.413
Meeting adjourned.
Everyone, get back to work.

00:23:59.413 --> 00:24:01.280
And please make sure
to keep pushing forward

00:24:01.302 --> 00:24:03.090
on whatever you are handling right now.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.330
That's it. It's fine.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:05.860
Alright. Okay. Let's go.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.010

You were joking just now, right?

00:24:58.290 --> 00:24:59.620
I have already made my decision.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:04.660
But do not worry.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:06.810
You have worked
at Tengda for many years.

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:08.420
I will have Finance make arrangements.

00:25:08.435 --> 00:25:09.660
In accordance with labor law,

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.013
you will all receive compensation.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:11.860
What compensation?

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:12.968
What are you talking about?

00:25:12.968 --> 00:25:13.570
Mr. Pei.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.090
Are you joking?

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:15.770
Mr. Pei.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:17.635
Did the company
run into some kind of trouble?

00:25:17.635 --> 00:25:18.620
We can solve it together.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.380
Yes.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.250
Mr. Pei.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.220
Why is this so sudden?

00:25:24.946 --> 00:25:27.330
I have always taken you
as a professional role model.

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:29.290
But over these years,

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.620
you always seemed like
you were carrying a heavy burden.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:36.380
Are you really giving up?

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.380
Lin Wan.

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:45.420
I am actually not worthy
of being your role model.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:49.140
All these years,

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:50.530
I never once thought

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.413
about holding on
for the sake of the company.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:56.620
I wanted to give up long ago.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:58.570
No.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.700
We all believe in you.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.013
You are not that kind of person.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:06.860
What if I am exactly
that kind of person?

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:13.140
I made Bao Xu, who hates going out,

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:13.940
go traveling.

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:16.810
I made Lv, who did not
want responsibility,

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:18.530
take charge of the game.

00:26:19.257 --> 00:26:21.460
I sent Ma Yang,
who knows nothing about investment,

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.810
to run DreamForge Capital.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.270
I forced you to work on the genre
you hated most, soulslike games.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.180
I made Huang Sibo write that script

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.180
