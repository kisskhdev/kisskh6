00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.220
Your dad’s really sick, man

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.740
I heard it’s stage three cancer.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.240
Do you think I should go see him?

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.050
So if you ask me,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.250
you should choose the path where your dad

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.130
can’t hurt you anymore.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.500
We work for Mr. Thaweekhunn.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.330
He sent us to take you,Mr. Po, to the Phetchaburi residence.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.190
Alright.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.790
I’ll go.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.220
Phong, what have you played to get yourself all dirty?

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.180
Dad doesn’t like it, you know that.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.340
Why are you so stubborn, sweetheart?

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.840
Khun Po.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.480
This is Khun Praew, the tycoon’s wife.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.120
Hello.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.460
Hello, Khun Po.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.000
Phong, have you greeted Khun Po yet, son?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.210
Hello.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.320
Hello.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.100
Are you doing well, Khun Po?

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.080
I’m doing well.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.259
And how is your mother, Khun Po?

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.960
My mother passed away a long time ago.

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.710
I’m sorry to hear that.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.380
It’s okay.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.000
Please wait here for a moment, Khun Po.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.820
I’ll go get him for you.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.039
Thank you.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.509
Go… go get your father for P’Po.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.850
Mom.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.310
What are you doing, Mom?

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.970
I’m drawing.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.740
Can you teach me how to draw?

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.740
Come here, sweetheart. I’ll teach you.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.770
Scoot closer.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.380
You once told me…

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.410
If one day you feel lonely,

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.860
try drawing.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.420
Draw anything you want to see.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.250
Since that day,

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.000
I’ve never stopped drawing.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.190
It’s the only place where I still feel

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.460
like I’m myself.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.610
Not my father’s shadow.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.260
Not anyone else.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.530
Mom.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.880
I’m still drawing today.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.970
Oh, Po.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.210
I’ll help you, sir.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.000
No need. I can walk by myself.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.420
It’s been a long time, Po.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.290
How have you been, son?

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.970
I’m fine.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.800
Have you eaten yet?

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.230
Not yet.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.630
Your men came just as I was about to cook.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.520
I had the maid make your favorite, stir-fried crab with curry powder.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.450
Let’s go eat together later.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.589
I heard you’re sick.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.370
I must have done a lot of bad karma

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.000
to end up with such a terrible illness.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.030
Well...

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.000
You’ve done so much you can’t even remember?

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.690
The crab will get cold.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.470
Let’s go eat together.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.180
Mom, don’t forget to crack the crab for Phong.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.020
Of course.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.960
Phong.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.000
You’re grown up now.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.490
Stop clinging to your mom.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.220
It’s okay.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.690
I’ll crack it for him myself.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.810
Thank you.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.910
My pleasure.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.780
It’s because of you, Praew.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.100
How did you raise him?

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.300
How did you teach him?

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.350
He’s this old and still can’t crack a crab.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.320
How will he run my business in the future?

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.670
I’m sorry, sir.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.940
I’m sorry.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.909
And…

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.850
What about your other children?

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.280
What did you say?

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:51.380
Where have all your other children gone?

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.670
That’s none of your business.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.590
Prepare wine for me.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.000
Sir, but the doctor said… wine isn’t good.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.100
Shut up.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.120
Do what you’re told.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.310
Khun Praew, what’s your last name?

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.950
What do you want?

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.230
What is it, Khun Praew?

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.700
What is your last name?

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.610
Po!

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.620
My last name is Jiramatheerat.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.260
Khun Praew,

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.520
you’re not someone without choices.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.760
Don’t endure being oppressed by my father.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.200
You should take your son and leave for a better life.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.950
That’s enough, Po.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:03.730
It’s not too much.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.640
What’s too much is

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.000
that you’ve never even apologized to me,

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.690
after kicking my mom and me out like animals.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.890
You and your mother were bad luck.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.650
If you stayed in my life, I would’ve been ruined.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.390
Then why did you call me back?

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.540
What’s your scheme this time?

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.410
Don’t pretend to be a loving father.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.830
You can’t even remember that I don’t like crab.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.640
I never wanted to be your father anyway.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.420
If I didn’t need your help,

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.130
I would’ve forgotten you already.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.630
So what is it?

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.980
What do you want from me?

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.120
Ordain for me.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:55.430
Why?

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.580
Why should I ordain for you?

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.280
Master Long told me…

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.320
If I want to recover from this illness,

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.400
my eldest son must ordain to repay my karma.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.080
I won’t do it.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.640
Ordain for me.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.910
And I’ll give you twenty million, then go die wherever you want

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.210
I won’t do it.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.890
Fifty million.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.880
No matter how much, I won’t do it.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.620
Then how much do you want?

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.910
How dare you tell me to ordain to repay your karma?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
What debt of gratitude do I owe you?

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.460
What you did to my mother and me,

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.520
all because you believed that damn fortune teller.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:41.130
Isn’t this still not enough repayment for you?

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:42.659
You took everything from me.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.400
You broke my mother’s heart until she killed herself.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.620
Even her suicide note only had your name.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.180
And you didn’t even attend her funeral.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.480
Are you done talking?

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.520
What did you say?

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.650
If you’re done,

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.930
then tell me how much

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:19.810
it’ll take for you to ordain for me.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.090
Khun Po, please.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.710
Don’t do this.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.990
It’s sinful.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.090
It’s not good for you.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.300
Remember this.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.550
You’ll get nothing from me.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.070
The only thing you’ll get from me

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.040
is lifelong humiliation.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.410
How are you?

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.590
Do you feel better now?

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.390
Po, what’s wrong?

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.610
What happened?

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.830
He was so cruel to me.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.650
Calm down. Take it easy.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.650
He’s still the same person.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.630
Where are you now?

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.580
At your father’s house?

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.850
Yes.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.080
I’m at my father’s house in Phetchaburi.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.360
I’m driving back to Bangkok now.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:10:59.980
Are you okay?

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.530
Should you get a hotel first?

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.530
Driving now might be dangerous.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.050
I’m fine.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.770
I’ll drive back to Bangkok.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:09.430
But…

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.520
That’s all for now.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:11.210
Po, wait.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:12.110
Wait.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.850
Hello?

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.080
I don’t know if I’m soft-hearted or strong-hearted.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.210
Today, I stood in front of the person who hurt Mom and me the most.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.250
Part of me still hoped…

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.260
that he would say the word “sorry.”

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.090
But no.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.710
He’s still the same.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.420
Someone who sees me as a tool.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.490
Money.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.000
And pride.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.060
Even the word “gratitude”

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.410
is just an excuse for him.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.100
I promise

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.050
from now on,

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.780
I won’t let anyone hurt me again.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.420
Not even someone who calls himself my father.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.970
Yet I can’t help wondering

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.230
where this hatred

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.490
will lead me to.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.730
And in the end,

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.650
what else I might lose.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.230
Did you know?

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.180
Even the sweet, juicy taste of a peach

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.810
can represent happiness,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.090
sweetness,

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.190
and fulfillment in a relationship.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.820
But when it becomes overripe,

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.070
the taste is no longer pleasant.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.340
Sometimes,

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.590
it rots from the inside

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.430
without us realizing it.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:40.920
Just like relationships that seem good on the surface,

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.580
they may be filled with pain

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.320
slowly eating away at the heart.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.060
The sweetness once there gradually turns into bitterness and suffering.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.790
Until sometimes,

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.690
what we once thought was the taste of love

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.430
becomes something hard to swallow.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.980
Po.

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:26.400
You

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.560
How did you get here?

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.900
What happened?

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.330
How soon can I get back to Thailand?

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.280
What?

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.000
I’m asking,

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:08.850
how soon can I return to Thailand?

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:09.730
One moment, please.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.640
The earliest flight departs in one hour.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.660
Flight time is two hours and fifteen minutes.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.470
Would you like me to book it?

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.120
Get me a private jet.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:27.710
Yes.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.760
and will depart within twenty minutes.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.340
But…

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.550
Now.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.339
Forget it.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:09.190
How are you doing?

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.710
I’m sorry.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.400
Sorry for what?

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:21.080
For putting you through something like this.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.450
I shouldn’t have suggested you meet your father.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:33.500
No.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.490
I chose to go myself.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.560
It has nothing to do with you.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:44.240
But…

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:46.790
You are…

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.270
the one who's been kindest to me.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.450
I wanted to help you,

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.900
but I don’t know…

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.500
how to do it.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:11.320
No,

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:13.760
That’s not true.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.180
You’ve already helped me so much.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.240
Really?

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:28.760
Yes.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:37.740
Just…

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.950
Help me shoot a clip with you.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:47.950
That alone…

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.440
helps me a lot.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.230
This warmth

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:09.510
makes me forget everything.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.950
Even the wounds I just received.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.740
Leaving only one truth.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.480
I only want him.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.180
Only him.

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:17.240
It’s okay.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.620
Don’t cry anymore.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.590
Can you help make me happy?

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:00.700
Is that really okay?

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:19.630
Of course.

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.000
Because every time you’re inside me,

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.530
I’m truly happy.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.440
Are you sure, Po?

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:51.200
I’m sure.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:26.860
Will you sleep some more?

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:37.810
Thank you.

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:44.460
It’s nothing.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.750
I already told you, I’m doing this willingly.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:53.130
Even if I stayed there,

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.370
I wouldn’t be able to focus on work

00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:59.570
seeing you like this.

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:05.960
I’m sorry

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:11.860
I wasn’t there for you then.

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.370
It’s not your fault at all.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.660
Just having someone here now

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.200
makes me very happy already.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.730
I don’t know how to thank you.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.610
You won’t get any sleep at this rate.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.030
You…

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:24.160
That’s enough.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:26.720
Go to sleep.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:33.690
Okay, okay.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.210
Hey, you,

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:18.550
You should go shower.

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:20.110
You’re going to Singapore.

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:26.000
Come on, your flight’s at noon.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.970
But… you have to…

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:29.300
Hey you,

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.100
don’t go against me.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.150
Let me be your assistant.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:35.380
Okay?

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:43.560
So what do you need help with today?

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.720
Why did you rush back from Singapore?

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.670
Why did you go this far for me?

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.700
Because I had to.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.480
I’m really worried about you.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.900
Every time you talk like that,

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.600
I don’t want you to go anywhere.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:16.699
Then don’t push me away anymore.

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:23.280
From now on, I’ll take care of you myself.

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:32.780
You seem…

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.130
…better at taking care of me than a boyfriend.

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:38.620
That’s because I…

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:41.420
I want to be more than a boyfriend.

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:05.100
What are you doing?

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.000
You don’t look bad with a shaved head.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.500
Hey,

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:18.500
Mister,

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.880
Aren’t you worried about this?

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:25.040
Who says I am?

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.050
I’m not worried about it at all.

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:35.570
You hit me that hard, does it mean you’re over it now?

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.600
Go wash your face.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.290
Hey, you,

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:42.990
Wait a second

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:46.350
Want to go for a walk?

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:47.750
Or get some

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:48.690
rice porridge

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.560
at Soi 43?

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:58.330
Or should I cook for you here?

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:00.410
I’m too lazy to go out.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.440
I was planning to make ranjuan curry.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:05.330
to offer to my mom tomorrow morning.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.720
Ranjuan curry?

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:10.000
I’ve heard of it,

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:13.330
but never tried it.

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:14.910
Then…

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:17.770
I’ll cook it for you.

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:20.200
Sure.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.040
Well…

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:25.540
Inn.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:33.980
Yes?

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.810
Go buy the ingredients for Po.

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:39.250
I'm good, you don't need to do that.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:40.290
I've got this for you

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.230
Just let Inn buy them

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:43.500
Alright.

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:46.580
Well then,

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:54.230
Inn

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.470
take this with you.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.340
Are you my fan or something?

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:02.390
Come on,

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:03.630
I’ll sign it for you.

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:07.590
No

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:08.980
you don’t have to.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.470
Hey, let me sign it.

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:13.450
Inn, go already.

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:14.240
Yes.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.590
I’ll sign it for you.

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:19.430
Sasom!

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:21.040
Are you teasing me?

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.310
Hey, that hurts.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.790
Stop, I’ll really sign it.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:26.740
I’ll pull your ears out.

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.530
Hey, you!

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:30.690
Are you teasing me?

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:32.220
That hurts.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.340
Are you being stubborn?

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.710
I have a shoot tomorrow.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.520
If my ears turn red,

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.520
I won’t be able to work.

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:40.630
Then don’t go. Stay with me.

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:42.250
I can’t.

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:55.110
Can you help scoop this for me?

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:57.700
Sure.

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:11.550
Smells good, right?

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.070
It smells amazing.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:16.770
Like this.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.600
Can you help chop this?

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.040
Is this it?

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.170
Do you like cooking?

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:03.290
Me?

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.000
Not really.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.250
I prefer being an assistant.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:21.080
When I was a kid,

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.870
I liked helping my governess.

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:26.840
Your governess?

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:30.000
The woman who raised me and Ngern.

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:32.910
Oh.

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:35.580
What’s next?

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:36.670
Once that’s done,

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.730
put those leaves into the pot.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.090
As for the rest,

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:43.090
I think…

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:46.150
just seasoning a bit should do it.

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:50.000
You sound so knowledgeable.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:54.760
I don’t know anything about this.

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:56.350
Not really.

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:58.840
I just remember it from my grandma.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.590
I might be remembering it wrong.

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:44.420
Would you please…

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.400
Try tasting it.

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:48.850
Isn’t it sinful

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:50.260
to eat food meant for offerings?

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:52.410
It’s not.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.500
I made a small pot just for you.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.530
The big pot

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.770
is for offerings tomorrow morning.

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:02.920
Try it.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:06.740
Rangjuan curry.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:09.180
It’s fragrant, just like the name.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.270
This is insanely good.

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.510
Seriously,

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:41.720
is there any country where you can marry curry?

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:43.980
What did you say?

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:47.910
I want to marry your curry.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.000
I’ll eat it every day.

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.420
Why marry curry?

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:55.850
Let me do…

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.260
the cooking for you every day instead

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:00.830
That’s true.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.510
Then I’ll marry the cook instead.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.530
You…

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:48.960
Hey…

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:52.530
Why did you come so late?

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.210
The shop’s about to close.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:56.900
I wanted to see if you were tired today.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.670
And…

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:08.610
I’m not very good at flirting,

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:10.870
but when I’m with you,

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:12.850
I feel at ease.

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:17.900
You’re funny,

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:20.790
but you seem sincere.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.400
Try drinking this.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.540
It might help you sleep.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.940
I never thought I’d like men,

00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:57.390
but with you,

00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:00.000
I can’t resist.

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.340
Then don’t resist.

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.130
Because I feel...

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:08.870
the same way

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:23.270
Slowly.

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:31.390
Thank you.

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:35.790
Did that hurt?

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:38.240
Did I...

00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:40.460
Did I go too hard on you?

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:44.770
No.

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:46.750
I like it.

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:48.810
Like what?

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:50.920
What I did,

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:52.390
or me?

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:57.840
Well..

00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:01.210
Both, I guess.

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:08.980
Go to sleep.

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:10.600
We have to wake up early.

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:16.520
I don’t want to sleep yet.

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:19.160
Then what do you want to do?

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:22.710
Well…

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:30.660
Do… that.

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:31.940
Which?

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:35.020
Um...

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:40.000
That thing...

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.700
Please?

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:47.970
Please?

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:53.620
Or…

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:55.320
Are you already worn out?

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:04.030
Should I do it for you?

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:11.390
Do you want me to do it?

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:12.810
No.

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:15.490
What are you doing?

00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:16.510
Hey!

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:17.980
I can do it.

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:19.380
No.

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.200
What did you just do to me?

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.600
What?

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:28.820
Don't be stubborn.

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.000
Don't be stubborn.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.170
Still being stubborn?

00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:58.770
Hello?

00:50:58.770 --> 00:50:59.360
Po,

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:00.850
read my Line chat now.

00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:04.290
What the hell…

00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:06.290
Calls just to say that and hangs up.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:07.760
What’s wrong with him?

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.030
Sasom

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:19.150
Woraphatcharakorn

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:21.470
exposed as a mouthpiece

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:25.500
for a famous fortune teller.

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:27.320
Claims of bad luck.

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:29.710
Fake rituals.

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:32.170
Losses exceeding seventy million.

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:38.000
Damn…

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:04.270
Hello, Meen.

00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:05.600
I need your help.

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.380
What is it?

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:07.620
I’m going to Singapore.

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.130
Were you secretly filming me?

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:13.930
What do you mean secretly?

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:15.730
I filmed you openly.

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:18.850
I don’t want to shoot clips with Po anymore.

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.070
But…

00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:23.050
I’m scared...

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.830
Scared that Po only…

00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:27.830
Only wants to shoot clips with me
