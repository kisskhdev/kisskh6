00:00:00.146 --> 00:00:01.192
(Previously)
Can I have your number?

00:00:01.216 --> 00:00:02.776
So we can stay in touch 24/7 if needed.

00:00:04.377 --> 00:00:07.060
Finally, our son's putting
his good looks to good use.

00:00:07.143 --> 00:00:08.823
When will you stop being stubborn with me?

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:11.172
I care about you no less
than the vet guy does.

00:00:11.532 --> 00:00:12.603
So you're saying,

00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:14.561
if I want to give John Wick his medicine,

00:00:14.986 --> 00:00:16.393
I should let you pry my mouth open?

00:00:16.688 --> 00:00:19.141
Just try to ease into physical touch.

00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:21.004
You did really well today.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.594
Here's your Meow Meow Rice.

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:30.049
Enjoy.

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:36.203
Granny Juu, look.

00:00:37.468 --> 00:00:41.012
Our café is lively again, just like before.

00:00:43.472 --> 00:00:44.272
(I know now.)
(What do you know?)

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:48.203
(I know now that every cat here
appeals to a different target group.)

00:00:48.454 --> 00:00:49.454
(What do you mean?)

00:00:49.538 --> 00:00:52.194
(Like Jiro, he's the girls' favorite.)

00:00:52.842 --> 00:00:55.610
(A tough one like John Wick
is adored by adults.)

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.770
(Jumbo's Gen Z.)

00:00:58.279 --> 00:01:00.012
(So he vibes with the Gen Z customers.)

00:01:01.067 --> 00:01:05.067
(And for the guys' favorite cat,
that's Jenny, our visual queen.)

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:06.464
As for you, Granny Juu.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.568
Don't be upset.

00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:09.578
You'll always be my favorite cat.

00:01:09.776 --> 00:01:11.400
Stop hyping your granny.

00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:13.813
Take these dishes to the sink.

00:01:14.482 --> 00:01:15.524
Customers are waiting.

00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:40.661
Do you need a hand?

00:01:43.572 --> 00:01:44.572
No, I'm good.

00:01:58.632 --> 00:01:59.632
What about you?

00:02:00.174 --> 00:02:01.174
Hm?

00:02:02.258 --> 00:02:03.795
Which one is your favorite cat?

00:02:08.836 --> 00:02:10.318
My favorite cat?

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:17.009
You...

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:31.583
wanna guess?

00:02:33.197 --> 00:02:34.197
My hint...

00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:37.208
it's the most stubborn one here.

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:49.407
Aren't all cats stubborn?

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.900
"Cat for Cash" (Episode 4)

00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:00.106
Excuse me.

00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:01.251
Yes?

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:03.615
Can I have a photo?

00:04:03.782 --> 00:04:05.001
Sure. If I'd known,

00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:08.247
I would've styled my hair.

00:04:08.698 --> 00:04:11.638
Uh… I mean a photo of me with Jenny.

00:04:12.938 --> 00:04:13.983
Well, never mind.

00:04:25.276 --> 00:04:26.525
What was that smile for?

00:04:30.204 --> 00:04:31.204
Did you see the notice?

00:04:31.392 --> 00:04:32.918
The power will be out this Saturday.

00:04:33.012 --> 00:04:34.308
Don't change the subject.

00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:36.702
Do you know an F1 racer once hit on me?

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:38.586
Check this out if you don't believe me.

00:04:46.907 --> 00:04:48.223
Isn't this AI-generated?

00:04:48.733 --> 00:04:49.733
I'm telling the truth.

00:04:51.116 --> 00:04:54.572
Fine. If you want a picture to fool people,

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.827
I'll help.

00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:03.111
Is this close enough?

00:05:04.382 --> 00:05:05.382
No.

00:05:08.321 --> 00:05:09.321
No.

00:05:11.966 --> 00:05:13.051
No, don't come any closer.

00:05:16.007 --> 00:05:17.225
Where do you want me to send this photo?

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:18.621
Send it straight to the trash bin.

00:05:31.302 --> 00:05:32.302
Hey, Lynx.

00:05:32.745 --> 00:05:34.107
I found this in front of the café.

00:05:34.153 --> 00:05:35.153
Which cat lost it?

00:05:36.862 --> 00:05:37.862
Oh.

00:05:42.777 --> 00:05:44.805
Come on, Jenny.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.184
You can always let me know
if you want a gift.

00:05:51.936 --> 00:05:54.395
(Oppa smells so nice.)

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:01.499
Hey.

00:06:01.811 --> 00:06:03.491
Can you clean the litter boxes for me too?

00:06:03.762 --> 00:06:04.777
Where are you going?

00:06:07.245 --> 00:06:08.623
Can't you tell from my outfit?

00:06:09.248 --> 00:06:11.192
I'm going to get my golden body back.

00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:13.584
I'll bring you a photo
of a buff trainer too.

00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:18.349
Lynx.

00:06:18.374 --> 00:06:19.374
Hm?

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.750
You…

00:06:25.768 --> 00:06:27.128
haven't removed the price tag yet.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.500
Having fun?

00:06:39.641 --> 00:06:40.641
I'm leaving.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.915
(If you like him, just say it.)

00:06:43.082 --> 00:06:45.706
(Skip flirting like a teenager.)

00:06:49.634 --> 00:06:53.120
I've only heard of mockingbirds.

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:55.327
Today, I found a mocking cat.

00:06:55.961 --> 00:06:58.622
(Tiger, I don't know
what's wrong with Jenny.)

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.502
(She won't eat.)

00:07:04.022 --> 00:07:05.022
Jenny,

00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:07.174
are you okay?

00:07:07.376 --> 00:07:08.414
Not feeling well?

00:07:09.283 --> 00:07:11.007
(Is she dieting?)

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.217
(But it might be too late for her age.)

00:07:15.262 --> 00:07:16.382
Come on, Jiro.

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:19.756
Look who's flirting here.

00:07:19.975 --> 00:07:23.908
(I think you should take her to the vet.)

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:27.711
(She can get treated right away
if something's wrong.)

00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:33.591
Good morning, Dr. Pom.

00:07:34.995 --> 00:07:35.995
Morning.

00:07:37.275 --> 00:07:38.497
Hi there, Jenny.

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:39.669
What's wrong?

00:07:39.837 --> 00:07:41.848
She looks down and won't eat.

00:07:42.082 --> 00:07:43.610
Could you check her for me?

00:07:45.457 --> 00:07:47.398
Let me see, Jenny.

00:07:49.368 --> 00:07:51.116
What's wrong?

00:07:59.095 --> 00:08:00.301
This collar…

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:05.821
With a stain on this spot.

00:08:06.366 --> 00:08:07.759
This is really Gong Yoo's collar.

00:08:10.722 --> 00:08:11.762
Gong Yoo who?

00:08:12.202 --> 00:08:13.309
My new cat.

00:08:13.989 --> 00:08:16.197
Ning, could you bring Gong Yoo here?

00:08:16.312 --> 00:08:17.312
Sure.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.797
Gong Yoo's here.

00:08:24.415 --> 00:08:26.901
There he is. Can't stay still.

00:08:27.635 --> 00:08:29.020
Come on. Stay cool.

00:08:31.193 --> 00:08:33.298
He snuck out yesterday

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.010
and lost his collar.

00:08:36.605 --> 00:08:38.313
Beautiful Jenny was the one who found it.

00:08:38.713 --> 00:08:40.393
(Thanks a lot, Jenny.)

00:08:40.538 --> 00:08:43.032
(You're welcome, Gong Yoo oppa.)

00:08:43.183 --> 00:08:45.102
(You're handsome, just like your name.)

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:48.903
Is it just me?

00:08:49.213 --> 00:08:51.221
Why does Jenny seem
more energetic now?

00:08:52.654 --> 00:08:53.758
No, it's not just you.

00:08:54.795 --> 00:08:57.128
I don't think our daughter is sick.

00:08:57.769 --> 00:08:59.506
She's just in love.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.250
No, that's unlikely.

00:09:01.602 --> 00:09:02.605
All the cats have been…

00:09:02.999 --> 00:09:04.429
neutered, right?

00:09:06.187 --> 00:09:07.187
Wait a minute.

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.615
I think…

00:09:15.831 --> 00:09:16.831
Yeah, I was right.

00:09:17.199 --> 00:09:18.508
If we don't count Jumbo,

00:09:18.646 --> 00:09:20.411
Jenny is the only cat who isn't spayed.

00:09:21.259 --> 00:09:23.110
Je Meow wanted her to have kittens.

00:09:24.216 --> 00:09:27.114
But she hasn't swiped right
on any cat yet.

00:09:30.466 --> 00:09:31.727
From what I see,

00:09:31.983 --> 00:09:33.313
that wasn't just a swipe right.

00:09:33.941 --> 00:09:35.208
She super liked him.

00:09:38.229 --> 00:09:41.502
Actually, Gong Yoo's at the age
to start a family too.

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:45.183
Lynx,

00:09:47.393 --> 00:09:48.753
should we become one family?

00:09:57.407 --> 00:10:00.055
You mean the cats, right?

00:10:26.774 --> 00:10:28.395
Come on out.

00:10:31.127 --> 00:10:32.127
We're home.

00:10:32.296 --> 00:10:33.687
Let's get inside.

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:37.802
We're home now.

00:10:37.968 --> 00:10:38.768
Let's go.

00:10:38.902 --> 00:10:39.902
Hey!

00:10:41.734 --> 00:10:42.862
Aren't you going to ask

00:10:43.836 --> 00:10:44.836
why I'm mad?

00:10:47.499 --> 00:10:48.508
Are you mad at me?

00:10:49.745 --> 00:10:50.745
Yeah.

00:10:57.336 --> 00:10:59.022
You're trying to
matchmake my daughter.

00:10:59.778 --> 00:11:01.538
Have you asked if Dad
is okay with that?

00:11:02.556 --> 00:11:05.008
What's wrong with Dr. Pom's cat?

00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:08.288
He's handsome,
sweet, and well-bred.

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:10.053
And what's wrong
with the cat in this house?

00:11:10.808 --> 00:11:11.808
Isn't it "him"

00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:14.159
that's always by your side
during the hard times?

00:11:16.537 --> 00:11:19.333
Are you still talking about cats?

00:11:21.939 --> 00:11:22.939
Yeah.

00:11:23.715 --> 00:11:24.908
You really don't get it.

00:11:26.626 --> 00:11:27.626
I'm leaving then.

00:11:46.314 --> 00:11:47.314
Let's get inside.

00:11:50.612 --> 00:11:53.803
So someone's hitting on your crush.

00:11:56.504 --> 00:11:57.610
Yeah, Pa.

00:11:59.007 --> 00:12:01.623
And my crush goes along with it.

00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:07.821
Did you confess
your feelings to your crush?

00:12:11.229 --> 00:12:12.480
Huh, no.

00:12:13.812 --> 00:12:16.422
You're going to wait
until you get a wedding invitation?

00:12:20.402 --> 00:12:22.217
I'm just not that person's type.

00:12:24.091 --> 00:12:30.115
That person like warm, kind guys,
with a medical degree on the wall.

00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:36.318
Warm? I don't think
you are second to anyone.

00:12:37.851 --> 00:12:40.806
You even cried watching The Tiger King.

00:12:42.548 --> 00:12:43.701
Why would you bring that up?

00:12:45.298 --> 00:12:46.409
It's gonna be alright.

00:12:46.981 --> 00:12:48.725
There's still tomorrow to try again.

00:12:51.443 --> 00:12:52.443
Cheers.

00:12:59.538 --> 00:13:00.599
Try again tomorrow.

00:13:00.765 --> 00:13:01.765
Thanks, Pa.

00:13:37.994 --> 00:13:40.639
What? My Jenny is in love?

00:13:42.175 --> 00:13:44.909
Yeah. With Dr. Pom's
Korean-style oppa cat.

00:13:45.105 --> 00:13:45.989
His name's Gong Yoo.

00:13:46.056 --> 00:13:47.056
Gong Yoo?

00:13:48.659 --> 00:13:51.397
My legs are shaking,
and it's not a K-pop dance move.

00:13:51.754 --> 00:13:53.480
It's the reaction to having
my heart broken.

00:13:54.202 --> 00:13:55.508
Hang in there.

00:13:56.954 --> 00:13:57.954
It's okay.

00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:00.909
If Jenny really chooses that oppa,

00:14:01.437 --> 00:14:04.637
this "Oppor" will step aside.

00:14:07.339 --> 00:14:13.013
I'd rather be nice guy alone,
than be someone bad without you.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.039
You'll catch a cold, you silly thing.

00:15:09.985 --> 00:15:10.989
What's gotten into you?

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:12.745
You're giving me goosebumps.

00:15:13.636 --> 00:15:15.378
You just saw me in microwave mode.

00:15:20.717 --> 00:15:21.923
If you're changing modes,

00:15:22.835 --> 00:15:24.106
change your smoking habit too.

00:15:24.691 --> 00:15:26.097
Cats hate the smell of cigarettes.

00:15:31.823 --> 00:15:32.823
Lynx.

00:15:33.351 --> 00:15:34.618
Hi, Dr. Pom.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.106
I was just out running around here
with Gong Yoo.

00:15:38.728 --> 00:15:41.591
Is it okay if I come in
for a cup of coffee?

00:15:42.707 --> 00:15:43.707
Absolutely.

00:16:09.312 --> 00:16:11.113
That's the one, Gong Yoo.

00:16:12.716 --> 00:16:14.303
The cat who stole Jenny's heart.

00:16:14.842 --> 00:16:19.073
(His face screams
"Gong Tek" more. Right, folks?)

00:16:19.162 --> 00:16:22.118
(Wow, he still has his balls.)

00:16:22.293 --> 00:16:25.338
(Bro Jiro's got none left,
but a big belly.)

00:16:25.438 --> 00:16:26.438
(Butt out!)

00:16:26.573 --> 00:16:31.708
(Granny Juu, tell Jenny
not to judge a cat by its fur.)

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:36.360
(Eotteoke, shinja, gwenchanayo…)

00:16:36.524 --> 00:16:38.722
(What, Granny?
(How could you fall for him too?)

00:16:39.017 --> 00:16:42.791
(John Wick, my bro.
(I've only got you left. Help me.)

00:16:42.858 --> 00:16:45.639
(Just accept it. That's all I can say.)

00:16:45.762 --> 00:16:47.494
(What a useless bunch
of furballs you all are.)

00:16:47.518 --> 00:16:49.438
(Guess this coach
has to handle it himself then.)

00:16:49.534 --> 00:16:50.547
(Let's go, Tiger.)

00:16:54.134 --> 00:16:55.266
What are you talking about?

00:16:56.528 --> 00:16:59.826
I'm asking Dr. Pom to tell me
about Gong Yoo.

00:17:04.605 --> 00:17:07.246
These days, if you
want to know someone,

00:17:08.265 --> 00:17:10.110
you start with their parents.

00:17:13.461 --> 00:17:14.909
So, what were you like as a kid?

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.926
Well… just like any kid.

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:25.066
I'm a straight-A student
with some honors.

00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:30.915
Whoa. Total nerd.

00:17:32.246 --> 00:17:36.606
Me, I was a school track star.

00:17:37.416 --> 00:17:40.791
A teacher spotted my talent
while I was chasing my enemy.

00:17:41.636 --> 00:17:43.203
He even jumped on a truck.

00:17:44.149 --> 00:17:45.311
But I still caught up to him.

00:17:47.434 --> 00:17:49.009
Is that something
you should brag about?

00:17:49.793 --> 00:17:53.010
Alright, I'll talk about my son then.

00:17:53.536 --> 00:17:57.426
This son of mine used to be in
a Michelin-star restaurant.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.320
All high-class, VVIP customers
played with his belly.

00:18:03.293 --> 00:18:04.420
What about your son?

00:18:04.986 --> 00:18:06.498
Has he ever received such treatment?

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.213
My son can't compare.

00:18:08.726 --> 00:18:11.699
Gong Yoo used to belong to
a Korean teacher who worked here.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.513
But the teacher got transferred
to the countryside

00:18:15.067 --> 00:18:19.306
and couldn't keep him,
so I had to take him in.

00:18:19.833 --> 00:18:22.426
Oh, just like Jenny's story.

00:18:23.187 --> 00:18:26.713
Her original owner was a beauty blogger
who used Jenny to boost sales.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.693
When sales dropped,

00:18:29.059 --> 00:18:31.339
they just abandoned Jenny
and replaced her with a new cat.

00:18:31.973 --> 00:18:35.393
They both got abandoned,
no wonder they hit it off.

00:18:39.813 --> 00:18:42.806
(What? Am I wrong to be born
with a silver spoon in my mouth?)

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.426
(You all love drama, right?)

00:18:45.613 --> 00:18:47.820
(Here comes some refreshment!)

00:18:49.267 --> 00:18:50.267
Watch out!

00:18:51.483 --> 00:18:52.483
Are you okay, Dr. Pom?

00:18:52.583 --> 00:18:53.436
Don't worry about it.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:54.470
Your shirt got wet.

00:18:54.596 --> 00:18:56.232
Come upstairs.
I'll lend you some clothes.

00:18:56.256 --> 00:18:57.256
You'll catch a cold.

00:18:57.677 --> 00:18:59.117
Guess I'll have to trouble you then.

00:19:02.483 --> 00:19:03.848
Stay here for a sec, Gong Yoo.

00:19:12.883 --> 00:19:14.823
Jiro, look.

00:19:15.123 --> 00:19:16.733
That vet dude now gets
to be in Lynx's room.

00:19:16.757 --> 00:19:21.396
(What? I went from silver spoon cat to
filthy scapegoat just like that?)

00:19:24.656 --> 00:19:26.503
I only have small-sized clothes.

00:19:26.766 --> 00:19:28.303
I don't think they'll fit you.

00:19:32.976 --> 00:19:34.932
What about that one?
I think I can wear it.

00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:38.423
Ah, that one isn't mine.

00:19:39.603 --> 00:19:40.603
Whose is it then?

00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:42.503
It's Tiger's.

00:19:43.035 --> 00:19:45.598
He stayed over the other night.
I haven't returned it to him yet.

00:19:47.083 --> 00:19:48.116
Stayed over?

00:19:48.623 --> 00:19:51.516
Well, he was here
to help with the cats.

00:19:51.923 --> 00:19:55.843
And actually, we're coworkers…

00:19:57.603 --> 00:19:59.616
in theory.

00:20:01.697 --> 00:20:02.823
And in practice?

00:20:05.563 --> 00:20:07.396
I'm starting to wonder…

00:20:07.937 --> 00:20:10.756
he might...

00:20:11.437 --> 00:20:12.510
and I mean "might"...

00:20:14.496 --> 00:20:15.563
have a crush on me.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:16.890
I knew it!

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.956
That's why something felt off.

00:20:20.503 --> 00:20:22.123
He's trying to hit on my little brother.

00:20:22.883 --> 00:20:24.636
I'm still not sure.

00:20:26.556 --> 00:20:28.923
Do you have a way to test it?

00:20:50.463 --> 00:20:51.463
It's just…

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.716
you were gone for a while,

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:56.990
so I was worried about you.

00:20:58.117 --> 00:20:59.117
Ah.

00:20:59.537 --> 00:21:03.390
I took some time picking out a shirt.

00:21:04.023 --> 00:21:05.403
It was hard to find one I liked.

00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:12.210
Looks like we have the same taste.

00:21:13.332 --> 00:21:14.350
Hey, Lynx.

00:21:14.803 --> 00:21:16.096
Are you free this Monday?

00:21:17.223 --> 00:21:20.143
No plans. What's up?

00:21:20.713 --> 00:21:21.513
Want to go on a date?

00:21:21.574 --> 00:21:22.574
No!

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:25.950
I mean…

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.010
no worries about the cats.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:29.600
I'll take care of them.

00:21:32.566 --> 00:21:34.726
I want you to take Jenny
to go on a date with Gong Yoo,

00:21:34.843 --> 00:21:35.903
so they can get closer.

00:21:38.103 --> 00:21:41.003
Sure. Let's go on a date on Monday.

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:42.676
Okay, deal.

00:21:55.969 --> 00:21:56.969
Dr. Pom.

00:21:59.917 --> 00:22:02.330
Are you sure this will work?

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:03.810
Trust me.

00:22:03.916 --> 00:22:06.523
If Tiger really has feelings for you,
he'll definitely show up.

00:22:08.017 --> 00:22:09.017
Dr. Pom, look.

00:22:10.787 --> 00:22:11.787
Who's this?

00:22:12.349 --> 00:22:13.503
He's in every photo.

00:22:13.736 --> 00:22:15.853
Wearing sunglasses, probably a stalker.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.290
So scary. Who's this?

00:22:17.997 --> 00:22:18.997
I'm sorry.

00:22:23.736 --> 00:22:26.216
I didn't realize I was in the frame.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.003
What are you doing here?

00:22:28.309 --> 00:22:30.309
I brought Jiro out for a walk.

00:22:31.157 --> 00:22:32.157
What a coincidence, huh?

00:22:33.183 --> 00:22:34.183
Right, Jiro?

00:22:40.723 --> 00:22:44.110
Seriously, it's just a walk with a cat.

00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:46.410
Do you really need to dress up?

00:22:48.317 --> 00:22:49.396
This is my usual look.

00:22:50.656 --> 00:22:53.610
You've only seen me in casual clothes
and my café uniform.

00:22:54.589 --> 00:22:55.909
You're probably not used to this.

00:22:56.496 --> 00:22:57.496
Lynx.

00:22:57.877 --> 00:22:59.316
Us pushing this cart together,

00:22:59.383 --> 00:23:01.790
we kind of look like
dads pushing a baby stroller, don't we?

00:23:02.657 --> 00:23:03.657
We do.

00:23:05.896 --> 00:23:09.296
Jenny, you get to go out like this.

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:11.893
Sitting in a stroller
must be pretty boring, huh?

00:23:12.263 --> 00:23:13.543
Cats aren't like dogs.

00:23:14.169 --> 00:23:16.473
They prefer sitting still and
watching what's around them.

00:23:17.523 --> 00:23:20.336
Then why did we bring them here?

00:23:22.043 --> 00:23:26.546
To widen their world,
and to make some fresh content.

00:23:33.577 --> 00:23:36.337
Nice weather like this is perfect for
taking new photos of our babies.

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:40.823
Speaking of taking photos,
I came prepared too.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.500
Here's a trick to get more likes
in cat photos.

00:23:46.662 --> 00:23:48.315
You need to shoot at their eye level.

00:23:49.766 --> 00:23:50.766
Gong Yoo, come on.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:56.600
If they avoid looking at the camera,
use cat treats or toys to lure them.

00:23:56.661 --> 00:23:57.661
Gong Yoo, dear.

00:24:05.587 --> 00:24:06.695
(You done yet?)

00:24:06.834 --> 00:24:09.274
(I've been holding this smile
so long my gums are drying out.)

00:24:12.822 --> 00:24:15.006
Do you want a photo of you with them?

00:24:15.378 --> 00:24:17.924
Nah, I'm good. It's a hassle.

00:24:18.873 --> 00:24:20.606
There's research that says

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:24.293
posting photos with a cat
makes you look warm and kind.

00:24:25.069 --> 00:24:26.094
More importantly…

00:24:26.567 --> 00:24:30.372
It raises your chances of
getting hit on by 23.5%.

00:24:36.034 --> 00:24:38.798
Well then… since we're already here.

00:24:40.162 --> 00:24:41.814
A few photos won't hurt.

00:24:43.328 --> 00:24:46.416
Keep holding Jenny in your arms
and pat her head.

00:24:46.742 --> 00:24:48.222
I'll make it look like a candid shot.

00:24:49.109 --> 00:24:50.109
Okay.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.120
Jenny.

00:24:53.254 --> 00:24:54.520
Very cute.

00:24:55.702 --> 00:24:56.702
Look.

00:24:57.126 --> 00:24:58.921
Wow. It's really good.

00:25:00.278 --> 00:25:01.704
Can I post it on my Stories?

00:25:01.946 --> 00:25:02.946
Mm.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.320
I think the composition's still off.

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:09.110
It's not following the rule of thirds.

00:25:11.325 --> 00:25:12.969
Before you start using
photography jargon,

00:25:13.124 --> 00:25:14.764
how about learning
how to use that camera?

00:25:16.043 --> 00:25:17.493
Would you like to try it too, Tiger?

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:19.722
Then let Lynx choose.

00:25:20.318 --> 00:25:22.002
Whose photo will he choose
for his Stories?

00:25:24.224 --> 00:25:25.224
Sounds good.

00:25:26.174 --> 00:25:29.100
I want to see who Lynx will choose too.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:47.620
It's okay. I can do it myself.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.030
Let me.

00:26:24.075 --> 00:26:25.081
Can you smile?

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.800
I am smiling.

00:26:37.275 --> 00:26:38.619
Relax a little, Lynx.

00:26:39.498 --> 00:26:40.498
Think of it like

00:26:40.759 --> 00:26:42.959
you're using this photo
to charm people on social media.

00:26:46.804 --> 00:26:47.804
Okay, Dr. Pom.

00:26:48.526 --> 00:26:49.526
Ready?

00:27:15.767 --> 00:27:16.917
Are you done shooting?

00:27:24.433 --> 00:27:25.512
Alright. I'm done.

00:27:26.104 --> 00:27:28.112
(So bored~ I'm outta here.)

00:27:28.185 --> 00:27:29.185
Jiro!

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:30.790
Jiro!

00:27:43.462 --> 00:27:44.462
Alright, judge.

00:27:45.107 --> 00:27:46.604
Whose photo are you choosing?

00:27:53.501 --> 00:27:56.600
Tiger is good at snapping your photo too.

00:27:58.133 --> 00:27:59.311
It could be a fluke.

00:28:00.483 --> 00:28:02.203
How much more do you want
to see to believe?

00:28:03.217 --> 00:28:07.413
I guess I…

00:28:08.981 --> 00:28:11.109
want to hear it clearly from his own lips.

00:28:14.366 --> 00:28:16.020
But where is he now?

00:28:19.612 --> 00:28:20.709
I'm calling him.

00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:32.001
He left it there?

00:28:35.429 --> 00:28:36.429
You said…

00:28:37.088 --> 00:28:38.610
you wanted to hear from him, right?

00:28:40.513 --> 00:28:41.513
Yeah, why?

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:44.876
MY FAVORITE CAT

00:28:44.919 --> 00:28:47.703
You know how cats in heat
give off a special scent

00:28:48.096 --> 00:28:50.716
to let their potential mates know?

00:28:51.161 --> 00:28:52.223
I think…

00:28:53.174 --> 00:28:54.600
maybe you could try copying cats.

00:29:19.561 --> 00:29:21.126
I WISH I COULD READ YOUR HEART

00:29:31.264 --> 00:29:34.007
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO HEAR IT?

00:29:57.331 --> 00:29:58.331
I think…

00:29:59.236 --> 00:30:00.711
maybe you could try copying cats.

00:30:01.129 --> 00:30:02.627
How, Dr. Pom?

00:30:04.634 --> 00:30:08.592
Try switching up your usual perfume.

00:30:09.283 --> 00:30:13.318
Only the favorite cat near you
will know when your scent changes.

00:30:17.811 --> 00:30:18.811
Okay.

00:31:19.458 --> 00:31:21.103
Aren't you going to work yet?

00:31:23.855 --> 00:31:24.855
Huh?

00:31:29.286 --> 00:31:30.416
What do I do, Pa?

00:31:32.179 --> 00:31:34.821
Seems like I'm losing my crush at work
to that Pom-eranian dude.

00:31:37.471 --> 00:31:39.909
And what breed is your crush at the café?

00:31:40.235 --> 00:31:41.235
Persian.

00:31:44.585 --> 00:31:45.641
Wait, how did you know?

00:31:48.185 --> 00:31:49.640
I asked Dong.

00:31:50.076 --> 00:31:54.409
So I know you didn't open a lounge,
but a cat café.

00:31:55.888 --> 00:31:57.515
Sorry for not telling you.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.524
I just didn't want you to worry.

00:31:59.882 --> 00:32:02.826
You know cats are bad for your health.

00:32:03.832 --> 00:32:05.312
Why are you still obsessed with them?

00:32:05.343 --> 00:32:06.877
But my favorite cat…

00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:10.801
is the owner of that café.

00:32:12.098 --> 00:32:13.218
Je Meow's kid?

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.768
Didn't Je Meow have…

00:32:19.678 --> 00:32:20.678
a son?

00:32:23.087 --> 00:32:24.087
So what?

00:32:25.859 --> 00:32:27.018
Are you going to stop me?

00:32:44.065 --> 00:32:45.065
Fine.

00:32:46.021 --> 00:32:47.515
As my son,

00:32:49.012 --> 00:32:50.230
you're not allowed to give up.

00:32:53.907 --> 00:32:56.722
You know when I went after your mom?

00:32:58.449 --> 00:33:00.607
A hundred guys were chasing her too.

00:33:01.492 --> 00:33:04.416
But I managed to win her heart.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.724
But my rival is a cat doctor.

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:17.086
So what if he's a cat doctor?

00:33:17.474 --> 00:33:18.610
Come on. Don't forget this.

00:33:19.865 --> 00:33:22.189
Your dad is Singha Bangsue.

00:33:22.921 --> 00:33:25.111
The most feared creditor in the area.

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:31.470
That's true, Pa.

00:33:32.095 --> 00:33:33.526
Mark my words.

00:33:34.636 --> 00:33:38.507
This Tiger will crush that
Pom-eranian doc into pieces.

00:33:44.717 --> 00:33:47.557
About you opening a cat café,

00:33:48.984 --> 00:33:50.318
don't let your mom know yet.

00:33:51.091 --> 00:33:55.358
Otherwise, we'll both
get torn to pieces.

00:34:42.825 --> 00:34:43.825
Lynx.

00:34:51.027 --> 00:34:52.718
The power company's cutting power today.

00:34:58.371 --> 00:34:59.371
Yes, I know.

00:35:04.312 --> 00:35:05.312
Lynx!

00:35:09.908 --> 00:35:11.026
It's gonna be okay, Jenny.

00:35:11.171 --> 00:35:14.294
Don't you cry or pout,
This rebound guy will help you out!

00:35:14.719 --> 00:35:16.604
- Forget that player.
- Hold on, Krapor.

00:35:17.041 --> 00:35:18.041
What's going on?

00:35:18.652 --> 00:35:21.324
I ran into Dr. Pom at the market.

00:35:22.088 --> 00:35:25.918
He said the original owner
wanted Gong Yoo back today.

00:35:26.342 --> 00:35:29.240
I thought you and Tiger knew.

00:35:33.459 --> 00:35:35.623
Don't be sad, sweetie.

00:35:36.302 --> 00:35:38.324
Dad will find you someone ten times hotter.

00:35:38.882 --> 00:35:41.082
(No one can replace my Gong Yoo.)

00:35:44.721 --> 00:35:47.808
(Yeah, no one can replace Gong Yoo.)

00:35:48.329 --> 00:35:50.016
(So go say goodbye to him.)

00:35:50.132 --> 00:35:53.824
(What's the point?
(He has to leave anyway.)

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:59.107
(I know how much it hurts to keep your
feelings inside well.)

00:35:59.653 --> 00:36:00.653
(Go say goodbye.)

00:36:01.516 --> 00:36:03.705
(So you won't end up
crying later like I did.)

00:36:05.903 --> 00:36:07.583
Hey, how is she doing?

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.842
Lynx, close the café for a day.

00:36:17.004 --> 00:36:18.924
Let's bring our daughter
to confess her feelings.

00:36:24.295 --> 00:36:26.293
Krapor said
Gong You is leaving around noon.

00:36:28.775 --> 00:36:29.809
Hold tight, Jenny.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.699
Shit. Whose car is it?

00:36:32.784 --> 00:36:34.310
It's okay. Let me take care of it.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:45.421
Damn it. It's not moving.

00:36:45.587 --> 00:36:46.909
The handbrake's on.

00:36:47.085 --> 00:36:48.290
What else can we do?

00:36:48.393 --> 00:36:49.626
Want me to smash the window?

00:36:49.765 --> 00:36:50.905
Whose damn car is this?

00:36:51.075 --> 00:36:52.907
This is inconsiderate
as hell. What an idiot.

00:36:53.147 --> 00:36:54.557
I'm so pissed right now.

00:36:54.578 --> 00:36:57.258
Don't let me find out who parked like this.
I swear I'll punch them.

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.340
What a jerk.

00:36:59.044 --> 00:37:00.105
What do we do now?

00:37:00.838 --> 00:37:02.021
Whose damn car is this?

00:37:07.342 --> 00:37:08.342
We've got no time left.

00:37:09.926 --> 00:37:11.926
Hell with it. For my daughter!

00:37:17.673 --> 00:37:18.683
No one's answering.

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:20.830
The clinic's just ahead.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.380
We're almost there.

00:37:25.233 --> 00:37:26.233
Ouch.

00:37:27.207 --> 00:37:28.207
Lynx.

00:37:28.268 --> 00:37:29.268
You okay?

00:37:30.787 --> 00:37:31.787
I'm okay.

00:37:35.221 --> 00:37:36.310
It's gonna be too late.

00:37:36.789 --> 00:37:37.789
Take care of Jiro for me.

00:37:37.832 --> 00:37:38.832
What about you?

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.410
I'll show you that I never lie.

00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:03.413
Let's go.

00:38:09.261 --> 00:38:10.061
Doc!

00:38:10.283 --> 00:38:11.283
Doc, wait!

00:38:15.849 --> 00:38:16.849
Is everything alright?

00:38:16.919 --> 00:38:18.198
Do you have a minute?

00:38:18.956 --> 00:38:20.773
I'm bringing Jenny
to say goodbye to Gong Yoo.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:29.186
Sorry for not telling you earlier.

00:38:29.484 --> 00:38:31.800
The original owner just found a place
that allows pets.

00:38:31.926 --> 00:38:34.600
They have to leave soon,
so I need to bring Gong Yoo to them now.

00:38:37.302 --> 00:38:39.717
(I thought I didn't get
the chance to say goodbye to you.)

00:38:39.893 --> 00:38:44.507
(Congrats. They changed their mind
and want you back.)

00:38:44.616 --> 00:38:48.181
(In my case, they didn't even
bother to come looking for me.)

00:38:48.424 --> 00:38:51.621
(Since then, I've been scared
to open my heart again.)

00:38:51.912 --> 00:38:53.412
(Then I met you.)

00:38:54.218 --> 00:38:57.718
(During those brief times we had together,
I was so happy.)

00:38:58.296 --> 00:38:59.425
(I…)

00:39:00.153 --> 00:39:01.408
(I like you.)

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.306
(I'm sorry, Jenny)

00:39:03.476 --> 00:39:05.709
(But I only see you as a little sister.)

00:39:06.242 --> 00:39:07.400
(Gong Yoo oppa.)

00:39:08.714 --> 00:39:09.727
(Thank you, though.)

00:39:09.836 --> 00:39:13.512
(That's okay. Good luck… big brother.)

00:39:13.726 --> 00:39:15.052
(Take care of yourself.)

00:39:17.433 --> 00:39:18.433
I have to go now.

00:39:19.524 --> 00:39:21.712
Okay. Thank you so much.

00:39:24.561 --> 00:39:25.761
Bye-bye, Jenny.

00:39:26.001 --> 00:39:27.995
I'll ask them to bring
Gong Yoo to visit sometime.

00:39:29.656 --> 00:39:30.656
See you.

00:39:37.264 --> 00:39:40.915
I think our daughter's just got rejected.

00:39:41.303 --> 00:39:43.921
Yeah, I can tell that too.

00:39:45.626 --> 00:39:46.918
It's alright, Jenny.

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.992
You are pretty and strong.

00:39:49.402 --> 00:39:50.602
You don't need a partner.

00:39:51.837 --> 00:39:53.924
(You were so brave to say it out.)

00:39:54.263 --> 00:39:56.919
(I could never do that, you know?)

00:39:57.013 --> 00:39:58.604
(Thank you, Jiro.)

00:40:00.204 --> 00:40:01.724
Since we closed the café today,

00:40:02.161 --> 00:40:03.426
let's take a new set of photos.

00:40:03.873 --> 00:40:05.413
Don't make the cats blurry this time.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:07.220
Got it.

00:40:07.593 --> 00:40:10.720
This time, I'll take
better photos than Dr. Pom.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.360
Let's go.

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:23.920
We're home, Jiro.

00:40:26.693 --> 00:40:29.333
It's good to take cats out
for fresh air once in a while, isn't it?

00:40:30.346 --> 00:40:31.346
How about this,

00:40:31.587 --> 00:40:33.806
next week, whichever cats behave

00:40:34.106 --> 00:40:35.993
get two free field trip tickets.

00:40:36.986 --> 00:40:38.506
Does that sound good, Jiro?

00:40:40.987 --> 00:40:42.893
Alright, let me take
the cats to their room.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.120
You're home, kids.

00:40:47.767 --> 00:40:48.767
Alright, Jenny.

00:40:52.373 --> 00:40:53.373
Jiro.

00:41:12.391 --> 00:41:13.391
Lynx!

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.120
Lynx.

00:41:17.826 --> 00:41:18.866
Are you okay?

00:41:23.393 --> 00:41:24.640
Watch out for the broken glass.

00:41:25.207 --> 00:41:26.259
I'm coming right now.

00:41:26.667 --> 00:41:27.787
Are you a cat?

00:41:28.246 --> 00:41:29.819
How can you see in the dark like this?

00:41:45.006 --> 00:41:46.006
You okay, right?

00:41:47.159 --> 00:41:48.413
How do you know where I am?

00:41:52.166 --> 00:41:53.613
Though I cannot see anything,

00:41:55.826 --> 00:41:56.906
I can smell.

00:42:11.287 --> 00:42:12.627
Why did you change your perfume?

00:42:13.847 --> 00:42:15.206
I like the old one more.

00:42:18.147 --> 00:42:19.153
What about you?

00:42:19.953 --> 00:42:21.706
You don't smell like cigarettes anymore.

00:42:42.433 --> 00:42:43.433
Lynx.

00:42:48.279 --> 00:42:50.979
You used to ask me…

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.133
which one is my favorite cat, right?

00:43:06.973 --> 00:43:07.973
You…

00:43:11.873 --> 00:43:13.320
You are my favorite cat.

00:43:24.447 --> 00:43:25.666
Let's go on a date next week.

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:46.153
(Next Episode)
My name's Leo. I'm your brother.

00:43:46.873 --> 00:43:48.082
I was thinking of moving in here instead.

00:43:48.106 --> 00:43:49.847
You should start making good memories
with your brother too.

00:43:49.871 --> 00:43:50.616
I'm not sure about that.

00:43:50.637 --> 00:43:53.100
Look at all the cats in the café.
You managed to tame them all.

00:43:53.124 --> 00:43:55.003
I haven't even tamed the latest one yet.

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.242
And now there's another one.

00:43:56.319 --> 00:43:57.616
You two seem close.

00:43:57.721 --> 00:43:58.521
Are you dating?
No.

00:43:59.275 --> 00:44:01.907
Since you two aren't together yet,
can I flirt with him?
