WEBVTT

00:00:10.137 --> 00:00:12.612
Via, I’m thinking about my future too.

00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:13.638
So please...

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:15.265
don’t stop me from doing this.

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:17.058
I’m sorry for what I said.

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:18.560
I shouldn’t have said that.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:22.105
Thanks, the therapist you
recommended really helped me.

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:24.899
We’re here for you,
we won’t leave you.

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:26.359
Is he not coming back?

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:28.319
Coming back where?

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.279
To class.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.864
He’s been absent for a while.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.198
How’s your class?

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:33.033
I don’t have class today.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.534
You’re such a liar.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.746
Acting really does suit you.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:38.788
Larkin, what are you doing?

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:40.832
I’m not leaving your side.

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:43.626
I’ll trust you,

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.213
but Kino, you have
to trust me too, okay?

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.257
Promise me too that...

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:52.469
you’ll never think that
you’re a burden to what I’m doing.

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:53.803
Because you’re not, Via.

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:54.554
Okay?

00:00:54.637 --> 00:01:00.852
... As our friendship goes?

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:02.103
How was the song?

00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:03.855
He confessed, right?

00:01:04.036 --> 00:01:04.664
Let’s go.

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:05.857
Via, I love you.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.202
Push me away if
you’re not in love with me.

00:02:21.434 --> 00:02:22.852
Via, admit it.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.605
You’re falling for me.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:30.483
As if.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.559
Excuse me.

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:39.909
You don’t want to admit it?

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.040
Push me away if
you’re not in love with me.

00:03:57.716 --> 00:03:58.963
Via?

00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:00.028
- Ysha!
- Ysha!

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.559
What do you need from my girlfriend?

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.246
- Girlfriend?
- Girlfriend?

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.459
- Girl… girlfriend.
- Yeah—

00:04:11.571 --> 00:04:13.809
A girl who’s a friend.

00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:15.252
A female friend.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.023
Right?

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:17.590
What is it, Ysha?

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.395
What do you need?

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:19.901
Do you have a marker, Via?

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:20.885
- A marker?
- Marker?

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:21.844
- I have lots.
- There, a marker!

00:04:21.844 --> 00:04:23.012
- I have a lot of markers.
- Here, a marker.

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:24.072
Here you go.

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.640
There are so many colors, right?

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:26.891
What are you even using that for?

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:27.976
And go put something on.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:28.851
Go get dressed. Get dressed.

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:30.353
It’s for my boyfriend.

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:33.098
- Boyfriend?
- Boyfriend?

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:35.416
Yes.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.610
My friend, who is a boy.

00:04:38.541 --> 00:04:40.543
He gave me something yesterday.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.993
Boy friend.

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:46.528
Okay.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.246
All right, those are the markers.

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:49.205
Lots of colors.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.306
Okay.

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:51.249
Good night, Ysha.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.000
- Thank you, Via.
- Sure.

00:04:52.041 --> 00:04:52.959
Good night, Ysha.

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.669
- Okay, don’t stay up too late, okay?
- Good night, Arkin.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:22.059
I’ve noticed for a long time that
you’ve been wanting to tell me something.

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:27.677
No.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:29.162
I don’t have anything I want to tell you.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.831
You confessed, didn’t you?

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:34.584
When we fought you said,

00:05:35.793 --> 00:05:37.462
“I’m sorry that the way I love hurts.”

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.342
I ignored it because I thought
you still saw me as a friend.

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:46.054
But why are you jealous, huh?

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:47.847
Are you jealous of Clea?

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:48.950
No.

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:50.723
No, not at all.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:54.812
Whether we stay friends
or whatever we become,

00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:57.231
nothing’s going to change
between us, right?

00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:59.233
Our relationship with each other
will still be the same,

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:01.402
so it is better if we stay like this.

00:06:01.402 --> 00:06:04.572
At least nothing gets ruined,
nothing changes, right?

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:08.910
You don’t want us to be in a relationship?

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.218
I don’t want to.

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:14.624
Okay.

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.171
That’s it?

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:25.218
It doesn’t really matter to me
how you define our relationship.

00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:29.013
I’m fine with whatever you’re fine with.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.644
Let’s go to sleep, Via—

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:35.645
Yeah, Kino.

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:36.562
Let’s sleep.

00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:37.730
Yeah, I’m getting sleepy.

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:39.524
Let’s sleep.

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:40.316
Good night!

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.933
Why do I even love you?

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:41.169
Please welcome our leading actress,

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.587
Clea Aguilar.

00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:49.093
How many shooting days
have you had so far?

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:51.846
Has anyone’s attitude changed
since your first meeting?

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.264
Actually,

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.183
since day one,

00:07:55.516 --> 00:07:58.352
Arkin has always been a gentleman.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.438
And as the days go by,

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:04.425
I find myself noticing more
of his good qualities.

00:08:04.692 --> 00:08:08.237
And yeah, I’m really excited
to get to know him more.

00:08:08.262 --> 00:08:10.181
He is such a genuine person.

00:08:10.572 --> 00:08:13.909
If only you knew how kind Clea is.

00:08:14.425 --> 00:08:15.927
I am not kidding.

00:08:16.487 --> 00:08:19.073
I am sure people would love her even more

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:22.418
if they saw how good her heart is everyday.

00:08:35.264 --> 00:08:36.599
Speaking of hearts,

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:40.102
is there a chance you could
be part of Clea’s good heart?

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.616
I love you.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.454
I don’t want to hide how I feel anymore.

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.957
I’m tired of avoiding you.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:02.875
Avoiding us.

00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:05.920
I want to work things out with you.

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:08.673
Even if it hurts me.

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.926
Because I’m sure of what I feel.

00:09:13.344 --> 00:09:14.367
Because…

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:19.559
I’m sure that you’re the one I want.

00:09:21.317 --> 00:09:25.029
I’ve loved you from before until now.

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:28.192
And I promise,

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.404
I will never hurt you.

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:43.666
What was that?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.167
Why—

00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:47.219
- Why?
- What’s with your face?

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:50.047
Why, what’s wrong with it?

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:52.550
I was just getting into the scene.

00:09:53.561 --> 00:09:55.444
I even forgot Clea’s line.

00:09:55.469 --> 00:09:56.679
- What was it again?
- Whatever!

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:02.393
What was her line?

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:03.811
- The script is good, right?
- Where is it?

00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:05.479
Our writers are really good.

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:08.001
Yeah.

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:09.626
It’s good.

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.319
It’s romantic.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.653
Your movie is really good.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.114
Does it feel real?

00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:25.207
By the way, how
is Clea as a co-worker?

00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:27.168
Is she nice?

00:10:28.085 --> 00:10:29.170
Does she have an attitude?

00:10:29.727 --> 00:10:31.063
She is not hard to work with?

00:10:31.672 --> 00:10:32.774
Is she easy to get along with?

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:34.467
She is nice.

00:10:34.492 --> 00:10:35.784
Kinda intimidating.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.388
You can tell that she
is an A-list celebrity.

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:42.350
At least...

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.518
she makes your job easier.

00:10:45.853 --> 00:10:47.539
That is also because of you, of course.

00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:50.149
Via, thank you for everything, okay?

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.680
Like right now.

00:10:52.517 --> 00:10:55.437
You help me rehearse
my script and my scenes.

00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:59.659
And you still pack food
for me to bring to the set like before.

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:02.745
Thank you.

00:11:03.579 --> 00:11:05.956
I know you are busy
but you still do all this.

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:10.795
I am happy to do this for you, Kino.

00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:14.757
- One more time?
- All right.

00:11:15.424 --> 00:11:16.926
Where did we stop?

00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:19.804
Why is it like that? Why—

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:21.405
How do I do it?

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.365
Do you really have to do it like that?

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.641
It is not like that on TV.

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:24.475
I am trying to feel the moment.

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:27.144
And earlier, when you said your line, you
sounded like you were reciting a poem.

00:11:27.851 --> 00:11:29.185
Am I an actor?

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.481
Am I an actor?

00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:33.317
But of course I should feel something too,
so you should put in some effort.

00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:38.197
What’s with the face?

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:43.189
Here with us today is the
most handsome of them all,

00:11:43.365 --> 00:11:44.762
- the sexiest,
- It’s Arkin!

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:48.249
and the most talented actor,

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:50.584
Mr. Larkin Sanchez.

00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:52.795
Hi everyone, this is Larkin Sanchez.

00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:55.439
So cute.

00:11:55.464 --> 00:11:58.008
So, to answer everyone’s question,

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:01.011
is Larkin Sanchez still single?

00:12:03.931 --> 00:12:05.599
Yeah, I’m single.

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:09.520
I don’t see myself getting
into a relationship right now,

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.896
I want to focus on my career first.

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.524
- That is such a celebrity answer—
- I saw your pictures with Clea.

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:14.442
Via!

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:17.820
You two look so close

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.322
and your chemistry is really strong.

00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:23.576
So we are all excited to watch your movie.

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:27.621
I’m also excited for all
of you to see our movie.

00:12:27.801 --> 00:12:29.302
Clea and I worked hard on it.

00:12:30.499 --> 00:12:31.625
She’s fun to work with,

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:33.335
she really guides me.

00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:35.504
You know she is already
a veteran in this industry, right?

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.924
So if you’re watching right now, hi!

00:12:39.669 --> 00:12:41.003
Thank you, Madam Clea.

00:12:41.635 --> 00:12:44.013
Clea is really amazing, right, Via?

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.850
You know, she actually won
Best Actress for their last movie.

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:52.605
“Do not change or erase history.”

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:56.650
“It is carved into our wounds.”

00:12:57.818 --> 00:12:59.278
She was really great in that role.

00:13:00.404 --> 00:13:01.822
And people are talking.

00:13:01.822 --> 00:13:04.200
Is it true that you two
will have a kissing scene?

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.702
Oh my gosh, Via,
they said there’s a kissing scene.

00:13:06.994 --> 00:13:08.370
Is there a kissing scene?

00:13:09.997 --> 00:13:11.457
Just wait for it.
Let’s see in the movie.

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:12.558
Watch out for it.

00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:14.668
I’ll definitely watch out for that.

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:17.421
Why’d you turn it off, Via?

00:13:17.446 --> 00:13:18.272
Huh?

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:20.841
Oh, sorry. I’m sorry,
I accidentally pressed it.

00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:25.721
Maybe it’s broken, it won’t turn on.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.139
You two should just study.

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:28.390
You have a quiz tomorrow, right?

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.684
And you, careful with your fingers,
you might accidentally cut them.

00:13:30.684 --> 00:13:32.186
You better be careful!

00:13:32.376 --> 00:13:33.627
And you, just sleep.

00:13:39.367 --> 00:13:41.953
How do you feel about their kissing scene?

00:13:43.072 --> 00:13:44.156
Nothing.

00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:45.616
It’s just work.

00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:47.868
Larkin Sanchez and Clea Zorel Aguilar?

00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:49.036
They look good together!

00:13:49.036 --> 00:13:51.247
Yeah. I’m excited for their new movie!

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.776
You know, I think...

00:13:54.291 --> 00:13:57.795
if their love team becomes
a hit, it will be official.

00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.672
Because they already have
so many fans right now.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.590
There are Aunties of ArClea,

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:02.925
Uncles of ArClea,

00:14:02.925 --> 00:14:04.218
Shippers of ArClea.

00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:05.636
Should we join them?

00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:10.057
All right. Okay.

00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:12.476
You look like you’re about
to spike a volleyball.

00:14:12.726 --> 00:14:13.853
We’re not joining that.

00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:15.563
I’m also going to leave the account.

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:18.691
- Look, it’s Via.
- There she is.

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:21.235
Via, are you close with Larkin?

00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:22.778
He follows you.

00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:25.656
No, we’re not close.

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:27.449
- Wow.
- Wow.

00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:28.701
- You’re lucky.
- So lucky.

00:14:28.784 --> 00:14:30.077
Do you talk to each other?

00:14:30.494 --> 00:14:31.787
I wish he’d follow me too.

00:14:32.162 --> 00:14:32.872
Not really.

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:34.164
We don’t talk that often.

00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:36.183
But you know,

00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:38.627
I feel like there’s something going
on between him and Clea.

00:14:39.086 --> 00:14:40.004
Do you know something?

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:40.838
Spill the tea.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.882
Sure, you guys can go eat over there.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.259
Wow, stingy with information.

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:46.427
Go ahead.

00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:48.387
You guys are close, huh?

00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:53.767
I’m sorry.

00:14:54.101 --> 00:14:56.270
You’re getting dragged into my mood.

00:14:56.604 --> 00:15:00.482
I just don’t like any kind of
attention that comes from Kino’s fame.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.821
Good thing my social media is private.

00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:31.388
Via, come to our mall show.
It’s really close to you.

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:34.725
Let’s go!

00:15:37.686 --> 00:15:38.938
I don’t want to.

00:15:40.689 --> 00:15:42.232
What if my fated person is there?

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:51.784
Wow, there are so many people.

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:54.745
You mean so many people
being tricked by Arkin.

00:15:55.245 --> 00:15:56.997
What the heck, we don’t
even have any seats?

00:15:57.581 --> 00:15:59.416
- What is up with our buddy?
- Jeez.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.543
Nevermind, let’s go over there.

00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:02.211
I’m excited.

00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:03.504
I’ll follow, just wait, okay?

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:06.924
And before we call on ArClea

00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:09.885
of course we would like
to thank our sponsors.

00:16:09.885 --> 00:16:11.804
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.973
Let’s welcome, everyone!

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.767
One of the rising actor—

00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:19.561
but sadly, our leading lady,

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.814
Clea Aguilar won’t make it today.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:27.736
But let us all welcome the leading man
of the upcoming film, Falling Like A Star,

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:31.198

There you have it everyone,
Larkin Sanchez and Clea Aguilar!

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.920
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you very much.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.339
All right, the song is over.

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:36.341
So why are you still holding hands?

00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:38.260
I’m sorry. Force of habit.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.679
Larkin, are you trying to court Clea?

00:19:43.473 --> 00:19:45.517
Wait, someone is asking.

00:19:45.542 --> 00:19:46.643
Larkin,

00:19:46.668 --> 00:19:48.962
are you trying to court Clea?

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.617
No, not yet, nothing like that.

00:19:55.402 --> 00:19:57.154
Not yet?

00:19:57.154 --> 00:19:58.739
So will it happen?

00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:02.743
No, no.

00:20:02.743 --> 00:20:04.745
We just work well together.

00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:07.789
And honestly,

00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:11.251
I hope I get to work with him
more in the future because

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.337
he’s really fun to be with.

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:18.759
That’s how love teams that
end up together usually start.

00:20:20.588 --> 00:20:23.030
Seriously, Larkin?
You’re not gonna court her?

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:25.182
You’re single, right?

00:20:32.991 --> 00:20:34.034
I’m single.

00:20:41.698 --> 00:20:44.117
Hey! What’s with that look, huh?

00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:48.288
Clea and I aren’t thinking about that yet.

00:20:48.288 --> 00:20:50.870
We’re still getting to know each other and

00:20:50.895 --> 00:20:53.022
I hope to work with her
more in the future because,

00:20:53.047 --> 00:20:56.467
as we all know, this is Clea Aguilar,
she’s really talented!

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.552
Wow, look at those smiles.

00:21:02.552 --> 00:21:06.598
I’m sure next time backstage,
you’ll be saying something different to me.

00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:08.225
Right, guys?

00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:10.018
You’re really amazing,

00:21:10.018 --> 00:21:13.647
no wonder you have so many fans!

00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:19.486
Via, Via!

00:21:19.569 --> 00:21:23.031
Maybe it’s a good idea to leave early.

00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:25.033
You know, it’s kind of funny.

00:21:25.033 --> 00:21:27.160
ArClea already has so many fans.

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:31.373
Yeah, it looks like they’re really
taking care of their partnership.

00:21:31.456 --> 00:21:33.375
Kino’s management even had him delete

00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:35.752
the pictures of us together
from his social media.

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:37.174
Really?

00:21:38.213 --> 00:21:39.756
Oh, yeah.

00:21:40.757 --> 00:21:44.094
And there aren’t any pictures of you
on Arkin’s private account either.

00:21:46.722 --> 00:21:48.557
They really need to be careful now

00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:49.891
that he’s in a love team with Clea.

00:21:49.891 --> 00:21:51.435
Yeah. I mean, that’s fair.

00:21:51.435 --> 00:21:53.353
If something gets out,
they could get bashed.

00:21:53.353 --> 00:21:55.480
And the bashers these
days really go for it.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.380
So, it makes sense.

00:21:56.405 --> 00:21:58.866
I think Arkin is just
looking out for you too.

00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:06.950
Hey, did you see that?

00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:08.702
Hey, that’s…

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:11.371
Come on, let’s go quickly,
that’s what we were looking for.

00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:34.311
Via.

00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:36.730
Why are you here?

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.148
Don’t you have something planned today?

00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:41.252
I do.

00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:43.278
The driver will just pick me up later

00:22:43.278 --> 00:22:45.113
because I’m going to a party.

00:22:51.317 --> 00:22:53.319
About what happened earlier with Clea,

00:22:54.317 --> 00:22:58.029
that was management’s order,
you know, just for promo.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.297
Yeah, I know.

00:23:03.006 --> 00:23:06.510
I understand, and you’re right.

00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:08.678
You’re single, right?

00:23:10.347 --> 00:23:11.515
Kino, you know what?

00:23:12.849 --> 00:23:15.894
I want to keep you all to myself,
away from your fangirls.

00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:19.981
But I know that’s part of your job.

00:23:26.738 --> 00:23:28.990
Just tell me if you can’t
take it anymore, okay?

00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:36.081
I’m sorry.

00:23:42.963 --> 00:23:44.297
Thank you.

00:23:49.886 --> 00:23:52.055
My movie is showing on Wednesday.

00:23:52.722 --> 00:23:55.225
It’s okay if you don’t watch it.

00:23:56.351 --> 00:23:57.394
But of course,

00:23:57.727 --> 00:24:00.230
I’d be happy if you see
all the hard work I put into it.

00:24:01.898 --> 00:24:02.899
Of course.

00:24:02.899 --> 00:24:04.484
I’ll definitely watch it.

00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:06.111
Our friends already made plans.

00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:22.669
Wow, there are so many people!

00:24:22.794 --> 00:24:24.337
Our best friend is famous now.

00:24:25.075 --> 00:24:26.106
Let’s go!

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:30.302
Hurry up.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.221
- Arkin is really something, huh?
- Right?

00:24:34.514 --> 00:24:36.641
- I’m getting excited.
- This is it!

00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:38.435
This is it, Via.

00:24:38.435 --> 00:24:39.394
We’re sorry.

00:24:39.394 --> 00:24:40.395
- Can I have some?
- Popcorn?

00:24:40.395 --> 00:24:41.605
It hasn’t even started yet
and it’s almost finished.

00:24:41.605 --> 00:24:43.190
Ke, you know this
is my favorite, right?

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.484
Wow, there’s so
many people. It’s crazy.

00:24:45.484 --> 00:24:46.163
What flavor?

00:24:46.188 --> 00:24:48.584
Yeah, it feels like a
Christmas Film Festival.

00:24:48.945 --> 00:24:51.072
Hey! I heard there’s
a kissing scene?

00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:52.324
There is?

00:24:53.116 --> 00:24:55.202
Via, does Arkin even know
how to kiss?

00:24:55.827 --> 00:24:56.661
Of course.

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:57.829
You know, in the
interview they said

00:24:57.829 --> 00:24:58.955
we should watch
and find out.

00:25:00.957 --> 00:25:03.251
- You know what? Clea is glowing.
- It’s a surprise!

00:25:03.251 --> 00:25:05.837
I was with her
and Giselle two days ago.

00:25:06.463 --> 00:25:08.048
She really looks in love.

00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:19.309
- It’s starting!
- Arkin!

00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:20.644
Arkin!

00:25:51.925 --> 00:25:53.134
Wait.

00:25:54.177 --> 00:25:55.804
I love you.

00:25:57.305 --> 00:25:58.765
I love you!

00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:02.394
I don’t want to hide
how I feel anymore.

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:05.146
I’m tired of avoiding you,
avoiding us.

00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:12.237
I want to work things out.

00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:15.156
I’m not afraid anymore,

00:26:15.615 --> 00:26:17.158
even if it hurts me.

00:26:17.617 --> 00:26:18.910
You’re the one I want.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.037
I’m sure that
you’re the one I want.

00:26:28.795 --> 00:26:30.005
That’s a lot of fans.

00:26:34.509 --> 00:26:35.677
I love you too.

00:26:42.809 --> 00:26:44.588
From then until now.

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:49.357
I promise I will never hurt you.

00:27:18.887 --> 00:27:19.929
- He doesn’t know how to kiss.
- What?

00:27:19.929 --> 00:27:20.930
- He doesn’t know how to kiss.
- Hey!

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:22.349
The fans are going
to get mad, you’re so loud.

00:27:22.349 --> 00:27:23.933
That wasn’t in the script.

00:27:29.356 --> 00:27:30.383
Via.

00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:32.359
Are you okay?

00:27:32.734 --> 00:27:33.820
Huh?

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.321
You know,
let’s just eat out later.

00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:38.615
It’s okay. It’s just a movie.

00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:01.971
It doesn’t look good.

00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:05.016
- Sevi!
- What?

00:28:06.142 --> 00:28:08.061
Me? But Arkin is the one
who’s bad at kissing.

00:28:08.061 --> 00:28:10.146
- Exactly. Yeah—
- Eat more.

00:28:10.146 --> 00:28:10.730
Hi.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:12.315
Hey, man! We already ate.

00:28:13.305 --> 00:28:16.716
Here comes the Box Office King!

00:28:18.088 --> 00:28:20.382
- Have a seat.
- Sit down! Eat!

00:28:20.615 --> 00:28:21.700
Sorry, we ate first.

00:28:22.617 --> 00:28:23.451
Thank you.

00:28:23.451 --> 00:28:25.328
Sorry, I couldn’t join
the screening.

00:28:25.328 --> 00:28:26.955
I had a talkback session.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.125
We actually thought
you weren’t coming

00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:31.418
because of that
talkback session.

00:28:31.418 --> 00:28:33.002
The other one was cancelled.

00:28:33.002 --> 00:28:35.130
Well, Sam said you guys
were going to eat,

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.506
so I tagged along.

00:28:36.506 --> 00:28:38.091
That’s good to hear.

00:28:38.591 --> 00:28:40.552
So, how was the movie?

00:28:41.344 --> 00:28:43.388
It was great, dude!
I even got all giddy.

00:28:44.055 --> 00:28:46.099
But why do you kiss like that?

00:28:46.099 --> 00:28:47.350
You look like an idiot.

00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:49.060
You didn’t even practice.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.562
You’re the idiot! Jerk!

00:28:52.647 --> 00:28:55.150
So this is how
Larkin Sanchez talks?

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.568
You know, I should
have recorded this.

00:28:56.568 --> 00:28:58.278
- Then I’ll spread it.
- You’re gonna get cancelled.

00:28:58.278 --> 00:29:00.280
- That’s Larkin Sanchez.
- Go ahead, bash him!

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.907
Hey, I’ve got a new life now.
I’m an actor now.

00:29:03.616 --> 00:29:05.493
Cancel, cancel.

00:29:08.037 --> 00:29:09.247
New life, huh?

00:29:10.832 --> 00:29:12.250
He even walks differently.

00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:16.254
Via.

00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:18.256
How’s the movie?

00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:23.178
It was good.

00:29:23.803 --> 00:29:26.264
Even the cinematography
was good.

00:29:26.723 --> 00:29:30.160
But it feels like something
changed, you know?

00:29:30.185 --> 00:29:31.436
Something was added.

00:29:37.734 --> 00:29:38.860
Do you want to talk?

00:29:40.195 --> 00:29:42.155
Do you want to go out first?

00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:46.576
Okay.

00:29:46.576 --> 00:29:47.619
Let’s go.

00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:49.245
We’re gonna go.

00:29:49.245 --> 00:29:50.830
- Huh? You’re leaving already?
- Huh?

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.832
- Why? Stay here!
- Just let them be.

00:29:52.832 --> 00:29:53.792
Let them be.

00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:55.710
- Bye! Talk it out.
- Bye!

00:29:56.377 --> 00:29:57.921
Enjoy.

00:29:57.921 --> 00:29:59.214
He’s really bad at kissing.

00:29:59.214 --> 00:30:00.237
It’s different when
you’re a superstar, huh?

00:30:00.262 --> 00:30:00.815
Yeah.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.300
- He could have at least tried a little—
- Wow.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.468
- Yeah, his style.
- It’s different now, right?

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:04.469
Should I teach him?

00:30:12.018 --> 00:30:13.603
So what are we
going to talk about?

00:30:15.188 --> 00:30:16.856
Let’s talk upstairs.

00:30:21.694 --> 00:30:23.780
You go first,
someone might see us.

00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:26.574
Okay.

00:31:05.572 --> 00:31:08.199
Is it wrong if I want to be selfish,
even just this once?

00:31:21.462 --> 00:31:26.050
I want to have a place in his life,
more than just a friend.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.977
I want to have the right
to keep him to myself.

00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:38.688
Is that allowed?

00:31:38.713 --> 00:31:40.006
Via,

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:42.058
these are gifts from the fans.

00:31:49.532 --> 00:31:51.200
What?

00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:55.032
There are so many of these already.

00:32:27.942 --> 00:32:29.077
Via?

00:32:31.074 --> 00:32:32.992
Kino, I can’t do this anymore.

00:32:33.493 --> 00:32:35.703
I don’t want to be just a friend.

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:41.250
Via, I love you.

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:46.923
Let’s stop being friends now.

00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:25.628
Jeez!

00:33:25.628 --> 00:33:27.463
Sir Alvarez is really annoying.

00:33:27.463 --> 00:33:28.881
It’s so hard
passing plates to him.

00:33:28.881 --> 00:33:30.174
He always wants revisions.

00:33:30.174 --> 00:33:31.134
Oh my gosh,

00:33:31.134 --> 00:33:33.886
it felt like he just wanted me
to redo the whole thing.

00:33:33.886 --> 00:33:35.555
Via, what did he say to you?

00:33:35.805 --> 00:33:36.639
Huh?

00:33:36.639 --> 00:33:39.392
Same with me,
he’s making me revise a lot too.

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:46.223
Good morning.
Take care today. I love you!

00:33:50.403 --> 00:33:53.281
You take care too.
I love you too.

00:33:53.906 --> 00:33:55.575
Don’t let yourself
get hungry, okay?

00:33:55.575 --> 00:33:58.786
Stay hydrated, listen in class,
be careful on the way home.

00:33:58.786 --> 00:34:00.496
And don’t replace me
with someone else.

00:34:01.998 --> 00:34:03.958
You’re being
too dramatic.

00:34:03.958 --> 00:34:07.086
Fine. I’ll see you tonight.

00:34:07.628 --> 00:34:08.692
Hey!

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:16.179
Try holding her again.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:17.930
You'll get what you deserve.

00:34:20.266 --> 00:34:21.267
Cut!

00:34:21.267 --> 00:34:23.853
Next! Move! Come on.

00:34:24.937 --> 00:34:25.950
Thank you.

00:34:28.691 --> 00:34:29.776
Phone, my phone.

00:34:30.985 --> 00:34:32.528
You’re being too dramatic.
Fine. I’ll see you tonight.

00:34:32.528 --> 00:34:34.363
You’re in
a good mood today, Sir.

00:34:34.363 --> 00:34:36.532
I wonder who
you’re texting, Sir Larkin.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:42.455
She’s got revisions but she
looks like she’s on cloud nine.

00:34:42.455 --> 00:34:44.373
I bet she’s just in love.

00:34:44.373 --> 00:34:46.167
Oh, no need to bet.
It’s obvious.

00:34:46.167 --> 00:34:47.960
She’s been in love since before.

00:34:48.503 --> 00:34:49.614
Huh?

00:34:49.962 --> 00:34:50.963
What?

00:34:51.881 --> 00:34:53.091
What?

00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:55.510
I just woke up in a good mood.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:57.220
- I felt happy this morning, that’s all.
- Good mood, huh?

00:34:57.678 --> 00:34:58.971
I just woke up in a good mood.

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.516
Oh, so you woke up
in a good mood.

00:35:01.516 --> 00:35:03.851
I think he deserves to treat us.

00:35:03.851 --> 00:35:06.270
Yeah, treat us to coffee, sir.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.272
How about some matcha, sir?

00:35:08.856 --> 00:35:10.441
Do you guys
want snacks? My treat.

00:35:10.441 --> 00:35:11.943
- Sure. Since it’s your treat.
- Oh, wow.

00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:13.528
- She’s treating us, right?
- I’ll stay near you.

00:35:13.528 --> 00:35:14.862
Let’s go. Come on!

00:35:14.862 --> 00:35:17.615
All right, write down what you
want and I’ll take care of it.

00:35:17.615 --> 00:35:18.866
Matcha for me, okay?

00:35:18.866 --> 00:35:19.367
Matcha, okay?

00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:20.868
Spanish latte for me.

00:35:25.279 --> 00:35:26.613
Careful, be careful.

00:35:26.999 --> 00:35:28.126
What’s this?

00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:30.628
Just go straight,
straight ahead.

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:32.130
Hey, hey. Okay.

00:35:32.672 --> 00:35:33.631
All right, stop., right here.

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:35.591
- One, two, three—
- Okay.

00:35:35.591 --> 00:35:36.843
Surprise!

00:35:38.719 --> 00:35:40.054
Wow!

00:35:40.054 --> 00:35:41.073
Well?

00:35:41.848 --> 00:35:43.307
Well, well, well.

00:35:43.516 --> 00:35:45.017
You prepared this?

00:35:45.017 --> 00:35:46.310
When did you learn to do this?

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:47.854
Where’d you learn it?

00:35:49.897 --> 00:35:52.108
I watched how our
art department set things up.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:54.402
in one of our scenes on set.

00:35:54.402 --> 00:35:55.570
Then I just copied it.

00:35:56.045 --> 00:35:59.423
But the caldereta and adobo,
I cooked those myself.

00:35:59.448 --> 00:36:01.075
I asked Mama to teach me.

00:36:01.868 --> 00:36:03.828
Here, taste this first.

00:36:05.712 --> 00:36:07.260
Let’s try it.

00:36:18.551 --> 00:36:19.552
Well?

00:36:22.638 --> 00:36:23.639
Why?

00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:27.977
Good thing you’re
good at singing, huh?

00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:30.938
Is it… Is it that bad?

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.833
I’m kidding.

00:36:33.482 --> 00:36:34.483
I’m just kidding.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:35.860
It’s good, Kino.

00:36:37.612 --> 00:36:38.946
I got nervous for a second.

00:36:40.031 --> 00:36:41.032
Here.

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:43.367
You’re good.

00:36:50.833 --> 00:36:51.918
There you go.

00:36:58.507 --> 00:36:59.521
Cheers.

00:37:05.181 --> 00:37:06.390
By the way, Via

00:37:07.475 --> 00:37:08.476
I’m sorry.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.272
Why? For what?

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:17.235
I’m sorry because our first date
is just here in the condo.

00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:18.861
We can’t even go out.

00:37:20.696 --> 00:37:21.708
Kino.

00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:27.078
I know why
we have to do this.

00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:29.288
It’s okay with me that
only the two of us know

00:37:29.288 --> 00:37:30.831
everything for now.

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:34.335
We don’t need anyone
else’s permission, right?

00:37:34.794 --> 00:37:38.673
And besides, I’m happy
with your dinner setup,

00:37:38.673 --> 00:37:41.884
with your caldereta,
your adobo so—

00:37:43.302 --> 00:37:46.389
don’t worry,
you don’t need to apologize.

00:37:46.722 --> 00:37:48.349
I understand.

00:37:55.147 --> 00:37:57.775
Via, when I say
I’m single in interviews,

00:37:58.484 --> 00:38:00.152
please don’t take it
the wrong way, okay?

00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:06.534
If my manager tells me to do
or say things for publicity,

00:38:07.118 --> 00:38:08.411
please don’t get mad.

00:38:08.828 --> 00:38:10.204
I’ll make it up to you.

00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:13.124
And please always
remember those things…

00:38:13.541 --> 00:38:17.295
I’m not doing them
because I want to.

00:38:18.421 --> 00:38:20.756
I also don’t want to
drag you into my spotlight

00:38:20.756 --> 00:38:24.510
because I know
you’re trying to avoid it.

00:38:28.014 --> 00:38:33.185
Just don’t be too sweet with
other people off-cam, okay?

00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:36.731
When I see pictures
of you and Clea,

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:39.400
I get jealous.

00:38:39.984 --> 00:38:42.778
You get jealous!

00:38:43.321 --> 00:38:44.947
You get jealous.

00:38:44.947 --> 00:38:46.991
And you’re so happy about it!

00:38:49.118 --> 00:38:50.828
Don’t worry too much, okay?

00:38:51.704 --> 00:38:53.706
We’re only sweet on-cam.

00:38:53.706 --> 00:38:55.624
When it’s just the two of us,
we’re not sweet at all.

00:38:56.167 --> 00:38:57.877
Clea and I are just friends.

00:38:59.837 --> 00:39:01.589
Thanks for clearing that up.

00:39:03.132 --> 00:39:04.300
By the way,

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.344
my Meet and Greet
is next week.

00:39:07.094 --> 00:39:08.596
Are you going?

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:11.140
That’s the thing.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.936
Kino, I still have so
many projects to submit.

00:39:15.936 --> 00:39:18.064
I might not make it.

00:39:18.064 --> 00:39:19.940
Maybe next time? I’m sorry.

00:39:20.649 --> 00:39:24.153
It’s fine. It’s just a simple
Meet and Greet anyway.

00:39:24.403 --> 00:39:26.906
Maybe you can come to
the bigger events instead.

00:39:27.073 --> 00:39:29.075
Go to those, okay?

00:39:29.909 --> 00:39:31.202
So? Let’s eat.

00:39:31.494 --> 00:39:33.579
What do you want,
adobo or this one first?

00:39:34.246 --> 00:39:35.039
Caldereta first.

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:36.665
Caldereta first? Okay.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:40.294
Thank you.

00:39:40.294 --> 00:39:41.324
And rice?

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:42.880
Just a bit.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.714
Just a bit of rice?

00:39:43.714 --> 00:39:44.715
Yeah, just a bit.

00:39:48.844 --> 00:39:51.222
Via, are you joining
Arkin’s fan club?

00:39:52.448 --> 00:39:53.366
I actually want to,

00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:56.519
because I want to go
to Kino’s Meet and Greet.

00:39:56.519 --> 00:39:58.020
If you’re a member of
the fan club,

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.292
there’s a special perk.

00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:02.733
And you know, it’s also
a way to support Kino.

00:40:03.567 --> 00:40:05.069
Then I’ll join too.

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:06.028
Really?

00:40:06.028 --> 00:40:06.904
You’re okay with it?

00:40:07.113 --> 00:40:08.114
Will you come with me?

00:40:08.114 --> 00:40:10.257
What are you talking about,
I’d do anything for you.

00:40:10.282 --> 00:40:11.951
So here’s what we’ll do,

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:15.579
we’ll join his fan club, then
we’ll go to his Meet and Greet.

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:16.247
Oh, and you know what,

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:17.665
I’ll invite Kierra too.

00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:18.833
She’ll definitely come.

00:40:19.708 --> 00:40:21.210
All right, let’s see.

00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:24.088
Oh my god, there’s even a quiz

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:27.299
before you can
enter Kino’s fan club.

00:40:27.299 --> 00:40:30.136
Wait, his favorite color…

00:40:30.136 --> 00:40:30.970
Red.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:32.263
Favorite flavor—

00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:33.597
It’s Via and Luna. Hi!

00:40:33.597 --> 00:40:34.306
- Hi!
- Hi!

00:40:34.306 --> 00:40:35.224
- What are you two doing?
- Huh?

00:40:35.224 --> 00:40:35.891
What are you doing there?

00:40:35.891 --> 00:40:36.725
See?

00:40:36.725 --> 00:40:37.852
- Hey.
- Hey!

00:40:37.852 --> 00:40:41.397
Wow, they’re joining
Larkin Sanchez’s fan club.

00:40:41.397 --> 00:40:43.858
Oh, so you’re Rhythmics too?

00:40:43.858 --> 00:40:48.028
We’re going to Larkin’s Meet
and Greet next week.

00:40:48.028 --> 00:40:50.739
That’s also when he’ll drop
his first single, right?

00:40:51.699 --> 00:40:52.575
Are you guys going?

00:40:52.575 --> 00:40:53.826
Let’s all go together.

00:40:53.826 --> 00:40:55.744
That’s great.
We can go together.

00:40:55.744 --> 00:40:58.038
Okay, let’s all go
there together.

00:40:58.038 --> 00:41:00.624
What are your stan accounts?
We’ll follow you.

00:41:00.624 --> 00:41:02.126
Is that required?

00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:03.544
Of course, girl.

00:41:03.544 --> 00:41:07.590
News spreads
so fast on social media,

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:10.426
and you’ll get to interact
with a lot of fans.

00:41:10.759 --> 00:41:11.302
Don’t you want that?

00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:13.888
Make one already so
you have a place to let out

00:41:13.888 --> 00:41:15.556
your feelings about Larkin.

00:41:15.556 --> 00:41:17.433
Okay, okay. I’ll create one.

00:41:17.892 --> 00:41:19.560
What would be a good username…

00:41:20.728 --> 00:41:21.729
Oh, I know.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.565
@larkinsings.

00:41:25.483 --> 00:41:28.235
Cute, right?
Via, what’s your username?

00:41:31.864 --> 00:41:33.324
Right?

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:34.617
Username: olivyours.

00:41:34.617 --> 00:41:35.619
Oh…

00:41:36.911 --> 00:41:38.287
That’s cute.

00:41:39.205 --> 00:41:40.414
That’s so sweet.

00:41:40.706 --> 00:41:42.333
We already made ours.

00:41:43.626 --> 00:41:50.799
I swear, this is the first time I’ve
ever gotten jealous of a tumbler.

00:41:52.402 --> 00:41:54.863
Wait, am I still normal?

00:41:54.888 --> 00:41:58.408
He just smiled like that
and I already wanna cry.

00:41:58.766 --> 00:42:01.894
So this is what
Kino’s fans are like.

00:42:01.894 --> 00:42:03.979
Larkin Sanchez, messy era.

00:42:15.133 --> 00:42:18.806
Wow, Luna’s posts already
have so many engagements.

00:42:28.462 --> 00:42:30.756
“An ArClea fanfic
where Arkin and Clea

00:42:30.756 --> 00:42:33.717
are childhood best friends,
and Arkin has secretly been in love

00:42:33.717 --> 00:42:35.886
with her for a long time.”

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.954
I think it’s better if
I don’t read stuff like that.

00:42:50.192 --> 00:42:52.736
Can you share your
most embarrassing moment?

00:42:53.195 --> 00:42:54.697
My most embarrassing moment?

00:42:55.155 --> 00:42:57.324
I’ve done a lot of
embarrassing things in my life,

00:42:57.324 --> 00:43:03.080
but maybe the time I confessed
to my crush while crying,

00:43:03.664 --> 00:43:05.332
and she rejected me.

00:43:05.666 --> 00:43:08.168
Yeah, I think that’s my most
embarrassing moment so far.

00:43:09.837 --> 00:43:11.422
What do you think
your crush would say now

00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:14.008
that you’re famous?
Do you have a message for her?

00:43:14.008 --> 00:43:15.467
My message…

00:43:15.467 --> 00:43:19.138
My message is,
thank you for molding me

00:43:19.138 --> 00:43:22.308
into who I am today,
and always take care.

00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:25.519
That’s it. Thank you.

00:43:28.897 --> 00:43:31.525
I already loved him even
before he became famous.

00:43:43.078 --> 00:43:45.164
Hey, Via!

00:43:45.164 --> 00:43:46.248
Arkin’s something else, huh?

00:43:46.248 --> 00:43:47.249
Everyone’s cheering so loudly.

00:43:47.249 --> 00:43:48.959
Right? There are
so many people already.

00:43:50.419 --> 00:43:52.129
What about Ke?
Is she coming?

00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:55.382
She said she’s busy.

00:43:55.382 --> 00:43:56.550
You know how it is.

00:43:57.819 --> 00:43:59.738
She seems okay though.
Hopefully.

00:44:00.607 --> 00:44:02.650
At least she’s opening up now.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.975
Yeah, I just don’t want
what happened

00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:07.144
with Miguel to happen again.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.775
Hello!

00:44:12.399 --> 00:44:13.984
Let’s all chill for a bit, okay?

00:44:13.984 --> 00:44:15.694
Larkin’s not here yet.

00:44:15.694 --> 00:44:19.031
But for now, let’s play
a trivia game about him.

00:44:19.031 --> 00:44:19.990
Do you want that?

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.742
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:44:21.742 --> 00:44:24.161
Okay, I’ll start
calling the players.

00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:25.371
Do your best, there’s a prize.

00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:26.462
Who wants to go first?

00:44:26.872 --> 00:44:28.374
Here! Here!

00:44:28.374 --> 00:44:30.142
She’s a fangirl! She’s a fangirl!

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:33.337
- All right, you with glasses, come here.
- Luna, you’re crazy!

00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:34.338
Who else?

00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:37.883
Wow, your hair is amazing.

00:44:37.883 --> 00:44:39.051
- Who else?
- Me!

00:44:39.051 --> 00:44:42.221
Okay, you, quiet girl,
come here.

00:44:42.221 --> 00:44:43.180
Okay now…

00:44:43.261 --> 00:44:46.848
Girls, I’ll just ask you
questions about Larkin,

00:44:46.873 --> 00:44:48.291
are you all ready?

00:44:49.087 --> 00:44:50.797
Okay, first question,

00:44:50.822 --> 00:44:53.741
where did Larkin
go to high school?

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:56.631
Valeria High.

00:44:56.662 --> 00:44:59.623
Valeria High is correct!

00:44:59.648 --> 00:45:01.608
Yes! Yes!

00:45:04.824 --> 00:45:06.701
Okay, second question,

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.127
what’s Larkin’s favorite food?

00:45:09.261 --> 00:45:11.055
She’s so fast. Go for it.

00:45:11.228 --> 00:45:12.229
Caldereta.

00:45:12.229 --> 00:45:13.647
Caldereta?

00:45:13.647 --> 00:45:15.565
Caldereta is correct!

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:19.778
She’s on fire, she seems
to really know Larkin.

00:45:19.778 --> 00:45:23.573
Next question, what’s Larkin’s
favorite street food?

00:45:23.573 --> 00:45:24.635
Kikiam!

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.361
Kikiam?

00:45:26.493 --> 00:45:27.244
- Kikiam.
- You’re wrong!

00:45:27.244 --> 00:45:28.745
- Are you sure?
- Kikiam.

00:45:28.745 --> 00:45:31.289
Kikiam is wrong!

00:45:31.289 --> 00:45:32.582
Anyone want to steal?

00:45:32.582 --> 00:45:34.209
Okay, blue shirt girl.

00:45:34.501 --> 00:45:35.502
Betamax.

00:45:35.502 --> 00:45:37.337
Betamax, huh? Is she right?

00:45:37.337 --> 00:45:40.173
Betamax is correct!

00:45:40.549 --> 00:45:42.008
But he doesn’t eat betamax.

00:45:42.008 --> 00:45:43.009
How would you know?

00:45:43.552 --> 00:45:45.679
The internet said
it was his favorite.

00:45:45.679 --> 00:45:47.264
Well, maybe the
internet’s wrong,

00:45:47.264 --> 00:45:49.432
because he doesn’t
actually eat betamax.

00:45:49.891 --> 00:45:52.811
Guys, there’s a
debate going on here.

00:45:53.728 --> 00:45:56.856
We’ll find out later what Larkin’s
favorite street food really is.

00:45:56.856 --> 00:45:57.816
We’ll ask him.

00:45:57.816 --> 00:46:01.152
For now, you win, girl!

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:03.613
Where’s the prize?
She has a prize.

00:46:03.613 --> 00:46:07.075
For your effort, here’s your prize,
a poster of Larkin.

00:46:07.075 --> 00:46:09.786
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

00:46:09.786 --> 00:46:11.627
Let’s give her
a round of applause!

00:46:13.605 --> 00:46:15.231
But kikiam really is his
favorite street food.

00:46:15.659 --> 00:46:18.036
- Yes!
- Yeah!

00:46:19.963 --> 00:46:22.257
Hey! Via!

00:46:23.008 --> 00:46:25.468
He doesn’t actually
eat betamax, you know.

00:46:25.468 --> 00:46:26.720
Kikiam really is his favorite.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:27.178
So why—

00:46:27.178 --> 00:46:29.806
No need to be so mad.
Would you fight over a poster?

00:46:29.806 --> 00:46:31.975
But it’s true, kikiam
really is his favorite.

00:46:31.975 --> 00:46:34.019
- Right?
- Yeah, that’s true.

00:46:34.019 --> 00:46:35.812
All right! Rhythmics,

00:46:35.812 --> 00:46:40.191
are you ready to meet
the man of the hour?

00:46:40.191 --> 00:46:44.279
Let’s all welcome,
Larkin Sanchez!

00:46:57.276 --> 00:46:58.338
Love you!

Go, Larkin!

00:48:44.107 --> 00:48:46.276
Thanks so much
to everyone who came.

00:48:46.276 --> 00:48:48.445
That was my single,
Golden Scenery.

00:48:48.445 --> 00:48:49.779
I hope you liked it.

00:48:50.947 --> 00:48:54.200
It’s about someone who
wants to confess their feelings

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.036
to their closest friend but—

00:48:57.454 --> 00:49:02.083
but at the same time is too
scared to risk their friendship.

00:49:02.542 --> 00:49:06.254
Even so, he’s still hoping
their relationship

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:09.132
can grow into something
more than friendship.

00:49:10.637 --> 00:49:13.261
That’s nice to hear, Larkin!

00:49:13.261 --> 00:49:15.388
Let’s give
a round of applause, guys.

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:20.685
Larkin, question.
What inspired that song?

00:49:20.685 --> 00:49:23.229
Or who was it about?

00:49:27.942 --> 00:49:31.738
It’s about my friend who still
can’t confess their feelings.

00:49:35.909 --> 00:49:37.911
Really now?

00:49:50.652 --> 00:49:52.612
Audrey? Audrey, okay. Audrey.

00:49:54.427 --> 00:49:55.804
Congratulations.

00:49:58.223 --> 00:49:59.933
While you’re
signing there, Arkin,

00:49:59.933 --> 00:50:01.392
we just want
to ask you something

00:50:01.392 --> 00:50:02.582
because we’ve been
arguing about this

00:50:02.607 --> 00:50:05.026
question for a while now.

00:50:05.668 --> 00:50:08.525
What’s your
favorite street food?

00:50:08.525 --> 00:50:09.734
Is it betamax?

00:50:09.734 --> 00:50:10.735
Wait right there.

00:50:11.611 --> 00:50:14.322
Kikiam. I don’t eat betamax.

00:50:14.322 --> 00:50:16.366
Kikiam. So the girl was right!

00:50:16.366 --> 00:50:18.117
Here’s the girl!

00:50:18.117 --> 00:50:19.702
- Here she is.
- Where is she?

00:50:19.702 --> 00:50:20.703
So this is the girl?

00:50:20.703 --> 00:50:22.121
- There she is.
- You’re amazing, girl!

00:50:22.121 --> 00:50:23.081
You know everything.

00:50:23.081 --> 00:50:25.375
- Wow.
- You’re basically Wikipedia.

00:50:25.667 --> 00:50:26.835
Hell yeah!

00:50:26.835 --> 00:50:28.336
She’s my friend, that’s why.

00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:30.171
Hi, what’s your name?

00:50:31.005 --> 00:50:32.020
Rye.

00:50:33.216 --> 00:50:34.277
Rye?

00:50:34.759 --> 00:50:36.010
It’s spelled R-Y-E.

00:50:37.411 --> 00:50:38.418
Okay.

00:50:45.311 --> 00:50:46.312
Thank you.

00:50:46.312 --> 00:50:47.313
Thank you.

00:50:47.981 --> 00:50:48.982
Shake hands?

00:50:57.991 --> 00:50:59.784
Okay! Okay, idol!

00:50:59.784 --> 00:51:01.119
All right!

00:51:02.245 --> 00:51:02.871
You know what?

00:51:02.871 --> 00:51:05.081
Your initials are sorta
like an anagram to “idol.”

00:51:05.081 --> 00:51:06.184
Cool, right?

00:51:06.457 --> 00:51:08.418
- Wow, right?
- You’re right.

00:51:08.418 --> 00:51:10.086
Yeah. Move over there now.

00:51:10.628 --> 00:51:11.629
All right, thank you.

00:51:12.839 --> 00:51:14.023
Ouch!

00:51:14.048 --> 00:51:15.049
Via!

00:51:15.049 --> 00:51:16.384
- Hey! Are you okay?
- Miss, be care—

00:51:16.384 --> 00:51:17.719
- Are you hurt? You good?
- No, I’m fine.

00:51:17.719 --> 00:51:18.469
- You sure you’re okay?
- Yeah.

00:51:18.469 --> 00:51:19.053
Miss! Be careful!

00:51:19.053 --> 00:51:19.387
Huh?

00:51:19.387 --> 00:51:20.555
- You okay?
- I’m fine.

00:51:23.099 --> 00:51:24.309
I’m fine, I’m okay.

00:51:25.184 --> 00:51:28.229
You really are my idol!

00:51:28.229 --> 00:51:29.731
Seriously,
you’re such a gentleman.

00:51:36.237 --> 00:51:37.488
Miss, take care, okay?

00:51:37.488 --> 00:51:39.365
But wow,
you’re really lucky today!

00:51:39.365 --> 00:51:40.950
Like, honestly,
you’re way up there now.

00:51:41.618 --> 00:51:42.785
Take care, okay?

00:51:42.994 --> 00:51:44.746
- Take care, sissy.
- So cute.

00:51:44.746 --> 00:51:45.246
All right.

00:51:45.246 --> 00:51:46.956
- Just be careful.
- Cute, huh? Such a gentleman.

00:51:47.582 --> 00:51:49.000
- Take care now, up next please.
- Take care. All right.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.793
Next up! Come here, Larkin.

00:51:54.881 --> 00:51:56.257
Be careful please.

00:51:56.257 --> 00:51:57.258
Hi, what’s your name?

00:53:06.411 --> 00:53:09.205
I’m supposed to be
your girlfriend, not her.

00:53:11.822 --> 00:53:13.550
But you really
are my girlfriend.

00:53:18.381 --> 00:53:20.925
How many times
did you guys kiss?

00:53:26.297 --> 00:53:27.799
Why are you laughing?

00:53:29.475 --> 00:53:34.981
Just three times because
they needed different angles.

00:53:36.315 --> 00:53:37.316
“Just?”

00:53:37.692 --> 00:53:41.112
Just three? Just three?

00:53:44.073 --> 00:53:45.074
I’m sorry.

00:53:45.908 --> 00:53:47.952
But you were still
the first person I ever kissed.

00:53:48.536 --> 00:53:51.789
And the one
with Clea was just work.

00:53:54.709 --> 00:53:58.629
You kissed me once
but kissed her three times.

00:53:58.629 --> 00:54:02.425
Well, it looks like
I’m the colleague here.

00:54:02.425 --> 00:54:05.053
She’s got more kisses than me.

00:54:07.013 --> 00:54:08.056
All right,

00:54:08.890 --> 00:54:10.433
I’ll make it up to you now.

00:54:11.059 --> 00:54:13.019
How many kisses
do you want, huh?

00:54:13.019 --> 00:54:17.440
One million? One billion?
One trillion? How many?

00:54:19.233 --> 00:54:21.235
Okay, let’s start with three.

00:54:23.321 --> 00:54:24.322
Since you already got one.

00:54:24.697 --> 00:54:25.698
So three.

00:54:26.824 --> 00:54:27.825
One.

00:54:30.787 --> 00:54:31.788
Two.

00:54:34.165 --> 00:54:35.166
Three.

00:54:38.503 --> 00:54:40.505
So you’re ahead by three now.

00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:42.298
Really?

00:54:42.298 --> 00:54:43.299
Yeah.

00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:45.301
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:54:46.836 --> 00:54:47.837
We’re good now, right?

00:54:50.807 --> 00:54:52.141
I need to be ahead.

00:54:52.141 --> 00:54:52.725
Huh?

00:54:52.725 --> 00:54:53.559
I need to be ahead.

00:54:53.559 --> 00:54:54.560
Yeah, you are.

00:54:55.353 --> 00:54:55.895
Kino!

00:54:55.895 --> 00:54:56.646
Ow!

00:54:56.646 --> 00:54:58.314
By the way, I saw on the news…

00:54:58.429 --> 00:55:00.214
Looks like you’re being linked
to your love team partner.

00:55:00.239 --> 00:55:01.307
Are you two a couple?

00:55:02.735 --> 00:55:05.863
Pa, we have
something to tell you.

00:55:11.014 --> 00:55:12.808
I just want to know so...

00:55:13.121 --> 00:55:16.415
So I’m aware, so I’m ready if-

00:55:16.801 --> 00:55:17.979
Ready for what?

00:55:19.737 --> 00:55:22.932
So, Arkin, what’s the
real deal between you and Clea?

00:55:22.957 --> 00:55:25.018
I’m sure a lot of your fans are curious.

00:55:27.218 --> 00:55:29.262
Can’t you just tell it to me straight?

00:55:30.513 --> 00:55:32.390
Have some mercy on me.

00:55:33.266 --> 00:55:34.851
For my first song,

00:55:35.698 --> 00:55:38.688
this is the very
first song I ever wrote.

00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:40.940
I don’t know if you’ve
heard this one before.
