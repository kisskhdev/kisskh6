00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.380
(Previously)
What do I do, Pa?

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.701
Seems like I'm losing my crush at work
to that Pom-eranian dude.

00:00:05.936 --> 00:00:08.910
You know cats are bad for your health.

00:00:09.216 --> 00:00:10.646
Why are you still obsessed with them?

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.104
As my son…

00:00:12.652 --> 00:00:13.700
Are you going to stop me?

00:00:14.223 --> 00:00:15.424
You're not allowed to give up.

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:16.899
You used to ask me…

00:00:17.272 --> 00:00:19.913
which one is my favorite cat, right?

00:00:21.328 --> 00:00:22.328
You…

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:24.809
You are my favorite cat.

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.308
Let's go on a date next week.

00:00:33.837 --> 00:00:36.119
They say it's storm season, Granny Juu.

00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:39.009
I can't help feeling sorry
for those cats without shelter.

00:00:39.528 --> 00:00:46.106
(I hope some kids come by
and take shelter from the rain.)

00:01:09.087 --> 00:01:10.087
Want an umbrella?

00:01:11.116 --> 00:01:13.696
It's a storm, so it might be a while
before the rain stops.

00:01:14.802 --> 00:01:15.802
Or…

00:01:16.945 --> 00:01:18.025
would you rather stay here?

00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:20.291
That's fine.

00:01:23.608 --> 00:01:25.094
Want to come inside and take shelter?

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.400
"Cat for Cash"
(Episode 5)

00:02:44.656 --> 00:02:45.936
Have you decided

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.505
where you want our date to be?

00:02:47.774 --> 00:02:49.620
Huh? What date?

00:02:50.207 --> 00:02:52.084
I never said I'd go with you.

00:02:53.114 --> 00:02:54.114
That's fine

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:55.694
if you can't decide yet.

00:02:56.547 --> 00:02:57.547
I can wait.

00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:01.813
Working at the cat café with you
already feels like a date every day anyway.

00:03:03.865 --> 00:03:04.924
If that's a date,

00:03:05.283 --> 00:03:07.393
why am I scooping the litter boxes
every single day?

00:03:10.598 --> 00:03:13.128
So the birthday gifts for the cats
were your idea?

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:15.624
It was Madam Meow's idea.

00:03:16.574 --> 00:03:19.035
No wonder she never paid off
what she owed you.

00:03:19.675 --> 00:03:21.311
Three birthdays this month alone.

00:03:24.357 --> 00:03:25.636
One, two…

00:03:29.707 --> 00:03:30.707
three.

00:03:33.404 --> 00:03:34.404
Let's go.

00:03:43.518 --> 00:03:44.518
We've got everything.

00:03:45.824 --> 00:03:46.849
I don't think so.

00:03:47.702 --> 00:03:49.386
One more cat has a birthday
this month too.

00:03:50.581 --> 00:03:51.581
Which one?

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:52.853
I already checked them all.

00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:55.680
The one who's handsome,

00:03:56.406 --> 00:03:58.913
kind, has time for you,

00:03:59.716 --> 00:04:01.213
and helps scoop the litter boxes too.

00:04:01.647 --> 00:04:03.516
If that cat is a good boy,

00:04:04.973 --> 00:04:06.207
I might think about it.

00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:08.981
That cat's always been well-behaved.

00:04:15.104 --> 00:04:16.104
You know that.

00:04:22.953 --> 00:04:24.019
Yeah. I hope so.

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:27.265
Meow~

00:04:36.865 --> 00:04:37.865
Krapor.

00:04:38.424 --> 00:04:39.424
Why are you here?

00:04:39.762 --> 00:04:40.762
We're closed today.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.966
Isn't it obvious from the way

00:04:43.086 --> 00:04:44.086
I'm standing?

00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:45.179
I've got teen probs.

00:04:46.024 --> 00:04:48.521
So I came to have Granny Juu
read my fortune.

00:04:50.483 --> 00:04:51.483
Ahhh.

00:04:51.607 --> 00:04:52.621
What? Our Granny Juu?

00:04:52.701 --> 00:04:53.701
Correct.

00:04:54.304 --> 00:04:56.375
Cats have six senses.

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:58.989
Especially ones as old as Granny Juu.

00:04:59.403 --> 00:05:03.011
So Je Meow opened
the Juu-Te-Lu fortune-telling corner.

00:05:04.801 --> 00:05:06.012
Here's the thing, Granny Juu.

00:05:06.413 --> 00:05:09.099
The other day, I dropped off ice
at my friend's shop.

00:05:09.493 --> 00:05:11.007
His little sister was there,

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.912
so I handed her the bill.

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:15.403
She looked at it and said,

00:05:15.584 --> 00:05:19.098
"Hey, this isn't the usual price we pay."

00:05:19.498 --> 00:05:21.608
"Are you charging me extra, brother?"

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:23.620
She asked me that.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.780
Does that mean

00:05:24.826 --> 00:05:27.848
she's feeling something extra for me?

00:05:32.614 --> 00:05:34.613
She's picked!

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.471
This card?

00:05:36.518 --> 00:05:39.219
Yes, this card. Here we go.

00:05:43.188 --> 00:05:44.221
It's Seven of Cups.

00:05:44.376 --> 00:05:46.528
What does that mean?

00:05:50.512 --> 00:05:51.312
It means…

00:05:51.357 --> 00:05:52.357
It means…?

00:05:57.564 --> 00:05:58.809
Stop imagining things.

00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:06.503
Ah, it means my friend's sister
shouldn't imagine things between us, right?

00:06:06.892 --> 00:06:08.126
Because in my heart,

00:06:08.247 --> 00:06:10.304
there's only my baby Jenny.

00:06:10.504 --> 00:06:11.504
Right?

00:06:11.695 --> 00:06:12.621
The card did read you right.

00:06:12.666 --> 00:06:14.733
You're so accurate, Granny Juu.

00:06:15.406 --> 00:06:16.406
- Hey, Krapor.
- Yes?

00:06:16.508 --> 00:06:18.333
- Can I have her pick a card too?
- Sure.

00:06:18.668 --> 00:06:20.418
Well, I…

00:06:20.549 --> 00:06:21.549
You…

00:06:22.218 --> 00:06:24.184
- I mean my friend.
- Ah, your friend.

00:06:24.542 --> 00:06:25.907
He has a crush on his coworker.

00:06:27.101 --> 00:06:28.508
So he wants to know…

00:06:29.876 --> 00:06:31.203
is it one-sided?

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.295
Leave that to me, bro.

00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:35.818
I'll ask Granny Juu

00:06:35.978 --> 00:06:37.854
how that person really feels
about your friend.

00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:39.804
Go ahead, Granny Juu.

00:06:40.346 --> 00:06:41.722
There she goes!

00:06:46.262 --> 00:06:47.262
A bad card?

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.816
I can't read English.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.919
Help me.

00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:57.080
Strength.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.080
Ah, Strength card.

00:07:01.176 --> 00:07:02.021
Whoa.

00:07:02.081 --> 00:07:04.212
It says the person
your friend has a crush on

00:07:04.512 --> 00:07:06.411
is really charming,

00:07:06.672 --> 00:07:08.520
feisty, and fearless too.

00:07:08.627 --> 00:07:09.799
What's interesting is

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:12.819
they like being around four-legged animals.

00:07:15.796 --> 00:07:19.200
I'm not sure about the last part.

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:21.700
I always see them…

00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:23.561
fighting whenever they're together.

00:07:24.394 --> 00:07:25.919
They might seem tough on the outside,

00:07:26.185 --> 00:07:29.312
but they're actually
soft and sensitive inside.

00:07:29.806 --> 00:07:31.520
They fall for clingy people.

00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:33.713
Keep at it, they'll give in eventually.

00:07:34.457 --> 00:07:35.562
You're making stuff up.

00:07:36.195 --> 00:07:39.504
Granny Juu, tell him it's not that easy...

00:07:39.743 --> 00:07:40.743
Boom!

00:07:41.187 --> 00:07:42.320
There she goes again.

00:07:43.384 --> 00:07:44.512
Let me see.

00:07:44.772 --> 00:07:45.772
Ah ha.

00:07:48.997 --> 00:07:49.997
Three of Swords.

00:07:50.049 --> 00:07:51.215
It means a love triangle.

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:52.637
Hey.

00:07:52.748 --> 00:07:55.413
Is your friend a two-timer?

00:07:58.803 --> 00:07:59.803
No way.

00:08:00.211 --> 00:08:01.625
He's loyal, one love only.

00:08:02.533 --> 00:08:03.720
I can vouch for that.

00:08:03.794 --> 00:08:05.408
You can vouch for that?

00:08:06.396 --> 00:08:08.303
But Granny Juu never misses.

00:08:08.769 --> 00:08:12.122
So what does this Three of Swords
really mean?

00:08:20.102 --> 00:08:21.102
Sorry, sir.

00:08:21.253 --> 00:08:22.421
The café's closed today.

00:08:33.298 --> 00:08:34.311
Where's Je Meow?

00:08:45.737 --> 00:08:46.917
Je Meow already passed away.

00:08:51.824 --> 00:08:52.824
When?

00:09:00.619 --> 00:09:01.699
Three months ago.

00:09:05.601 --> 00:09:06.920
He doesn't look familiar.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.000
This kind of guy

00:09:09.573 --> 00:09:11.211
coming around asking about her…

00:09:11.792 --> 00:09:12.908
Sorry, Lynx,

00:09:13.808 --> 00:09:15.415
he's gotta be her sugar baby.

00:09:15.562 --> 00:09:16.923
- Are you crazy?
- Yes.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.797
I was someone Je Meow took in.

00:09:23.416 --> 00:09:24.910
But not in the way you're thinking.

00:09:31.105 --> 00:09:32.225
My name's Leo.

00:09:33.546 --> 00:09:34.619
I'm your brother.

00:09:45.289 --> 00:09:46.289
Take this.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:52.717
You might catch a cold.

00:10:03.954 --> 00:10:05.207
You're Kao's son, right?

00:10:11.591 --> 00:10:13.215
How is she?
Is she doing okay?

00:10:19.581 --> 00:10:20.714
She died three years ago.

00:10:29.033 --> 00:10:32.408
When I first met your mom,
you were still in her tummy.

00:10:33.034 --> 00:10:34.514
We almost got into a fight, you know.

00:10:35.999 --> 00:10:38.309
I thought my husband had a mistress.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.170
Turns out…

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.926
we'd both been played by the same guy.

00:10:45.753 --> 00:10:48.116
So instead, we teamed up
and beat up your dad.

00:10:52.587 --> 00:10:53.821
Who are you staying with now?

00:10:54.731 --> 00:10:56.504
With my aunt.

00:10:58.177 --> 00:10:59.579
She's not technically my real aunt.

00:10:59.655 --> 00:11:00.833
She was Mom's friend.

00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:02.021
I see.

00:11:02.647 --> 00:11:05.311
And now she won't pay for
my school anymore.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.214
She told me to find a job.

00:11:08.803 --> 00:11:11.118
Mom said if this day ever came,

00:11:12.452 --> 00:11:13.473
I should come find you.

00:11:16.064 --> 00:11:19.404
I didn't expect anything from you though.

00:11:19.997 --> 00:11:20.997
I just…

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:22.653
came here so she can rest in peace.

00:11:38.428 --> 00:11:39.628
Eat this first.

00:12:19.094 --> 00:12:21.454
You don't have to talk formally with me.
That's just not me.

00:12:24.929 --> 00:12:25.929
Call me Mom.

00:12:28.844 --> 00:12:30.397
We're all family here.

00:12:32.297 --> 00:12:33.297
Hm?

00:12:43.071 --> 00:12:44.490
Why don't you eat the mackerel?

00:12:45.416 --> 00:12:47.297
Mom never told me about you.

00:12:47.557 --> 00:12:48.677
How would she?

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.113
You never came home.

00:12:57.923 --> 00:12:59.123
Have you eaten?

00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:00.317
Don't worry about me.

00:13:00.931 --> 00:13:02.691
I can grab something
from the kitchen myself.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.700
You don't need to.

00:13:05.972 --> 00:13:07.125
I'll make something for you.

00:13:14.606 --> 00:13:17.322
This is something I should stay out of.

00:13:17.954 --> 00:13:20.013
Excuse me.
I've got some ice to deliver.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.414
You can go console him.

00:13:32.994 --> 00:13:34.110
I'm fine on my own.

00:14:19.628 --> 00:14:20.808
Are you okay?

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.906
How could I be okay?

00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:28.910
Why am I the only one
who didn't know any of this?

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.400
If Mom hadn't died,

00:14:35.187 --> 00:14:37.003
would I ever have known
I had a half-brother?

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:40.131
Je Meow probably wanted to tell you.

00:14:41.316 --> 00:14:42.616
She just didn't get the chance.

00:14:46.546 --> 00:14:48.417
So she left me to deal
with all this alone?

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.033
What am I supposed to do now?

00:14:53.319 --> 00:14:54.811
Play the perfect big brother?

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:00.900
Lynx,

00:15:02.092 --> 00:15:04.114
your mom didn't take in
every cat she met.

00:15:04.645 --> 00:15:05.698
I believe…

00:15:07.002 --> 00:15:09.117
if she chose to take care
of your brother,

00:15:10.871 --> 00:15:12.124
that means he wasn't a bad kid.

00:15:53.183 --> 00:15:54.183
Give it a try.

00:15:55.138 --> 00:15:57.421
I don't know if it's as good as
what Mom used to make.

00:16:24.926 --> 00:16:26.429
Is it as good as
when Mom made it?

00:16:35.678 --> 00:16:36.678
It's edible.

00:16:44.764 --> 00:16:47.117
How much did Mom
give you each month?

00:16:48.384 --> 00:16:49.404
Why do you ask?

00:16:51.758 --> 00:16:53.024
Are you gonna support me now?

00:16:55.369 --> 00:16:57.006
That's probably what Mom
wanted me to do.

00:17:02.265 --> 00:17:03.306
How much do you need?

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.011
If I can manage it, I'll help.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.210
Usually,

00:17:11.622 --> 00:17:13.711
the money she sent was for my rent.

00:17:16.752 --> 00:17:18.078
I've moved out of that place now.

00:17:22.243 --> 00:17:23.290
I was thinking…

00:17:26.124 --> 00:17:27.403
of moving in here instead.

00:17:54.166 --> 00:17:55.312
Do you miss me, Jumbo?

00:17:56.422 --> 00:17:59.308
You know I'm moving in here.

00:18:09.716 --> 00:18:11.026
You know Jumbo too?

00:18:14.021 --> 00:18:15.021
Of course.

00:18:15.492 --> 00:18:16.819
I named him myself.

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:18.658
He was really happy about it.

00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:22.222
(Yeah! Thank you, Leo.)

00:18:25.114 --> 00:18:26.321
I already got your room ready.

00:18:27.782 --> 00:18:29.104
You really didn't need to.

00:18:29.444 --> 00:18:30.719
Whenever I stayed over,

00:18:31.013 --> 00:18:32.326
I always slept in Mom's room.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.424
I'll take Mom's room.

00:18:37.342 --> 00:18:38.715
You can use my room instead.

00:18:40.967 --> 00:18:41.967
Fine.

00:18:42.524 --> 00:18:45.320
I'm just someone asking for
a place to stay anyway.

00:19:05.892 --> 00:19:07.525
If you want to judge me, go ahead.

00:19:13.898 --> 00:19:14.998
I'm not gonna judge you.

00:19:16.783 --> 00:19:17.929
That room…

00:19:18.573 --> 00:19:20.221
is full of your mom's memories.

00:19:21.852 --> 00:19:22.911
If it were me,

00:19:23.333 --> 00:19:24.819
I wouldn't want to give it up either.

00:19:27.864 --> 00:19:28.984
But from now on,

00:19:31.389 --> 00:19:33.749
you should start making good memories
with your brother too.

00:19:35.083 --> 00:19:36.117
I'm not sure about that.

00:19:37.231 --> 00:19:39.309
I don't know if I can.

00:19:40.098 --> 00:19:41.124
Of course you can.

00:19:41.637 --> 00:19:43.304
Look at all the cats in the café.

00:19:44.027 --> 00:19:45.304
You managed to tame them all.

00:19:49.637 --> 00:19:50.920
Ugh.

00:19:51.847 --> 00:19:52.994
So what?

00:19:53.902 --> 00:19:56.019
I haven't even tamed the latest one yet.

00:19:56.724 --> 00:19:58.010
And now there's another one.

00:19:58.727 --> 00:20:00.321
But the latest one…

00:20:01.715 --> 00:20:02.920
is actually easy to tame.

00:20:05.265 --> 00:20:06.833
Just go on a date with him. That's all.

00:20:08.734 --> 00:20:10.025
You've said enough.

00:20:10.115 --> 00:20:11.216
Go home already.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.920
Go.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.060
Go where?

00:20:14.152 --> 00:20:15.101
Go home.

00:20:15.174 --> 00:20:16.174
Go on a date?

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:18.523
Go home. Come on.

00:20:28.514 --> 00:20:29.921
Aren't you going on a date with me?

00:20:30.108 --> 00:20:31.108
Go home.

00:20:33.994 --> 00:20:35.115
I'm not talking to you now.

00:20:49.427 --> 00:20:50.513
Another case coming in?

00:20:51.613 --> 00:20:52.720
Two cats are crashing!

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.220
Huh?

00:20:56.167 --> 00:20:57.213
Two cats are crashing.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.320
What do you mean?

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.400
Here's the thing, Doc.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.506
We've got a new cat
moving into the café,

00:21:01.652 --> 00:21:03.756
but it doesn't seem to get along
with the resident cat.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:04.926
Any advice?

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.040
Oh, come on.

00:21:06.193 --> 00:21:07.562
I thought something serious happened.

00:21:07.586 --> 00:21:09.713
Cats are like lions in tiny versions.

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.999
When someone enters their territory,
they have to show who's the dominant there.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.506
(It starts with territorial behavior,
when someone invades their space.)

00:21:23.586 --> 00:21:29.086
(Besides that territorial behavior,
cats are possessive and hate sharing.)

00:21:29.346 --> 00:21:30.346
Looking for yogurt?

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.926
Go ahead. I'm full anyway.

00:21:41.053 --> 00:21:42.053
Ah.

00:21:44.447 --> 00:21:45.520
This tee is comfy.

00:21:45.707 --> 00:21:46.707
Mind if I have it?

00:21:47.527 --> 00:21:48.527
These too.

00:21:59.147 --> 00:22:00.147
(Dickhead.)

00:22:00.627 --> 00:22:03.706
(Lastly, cats are possessive
of their humans too.)

00:22:03.913 --> 00:22:06.300
(They're afraid you'll
love other cats more.)

00:22:06.467 --> 00:22:07.467
Hey.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.220
You went heavy on the perfume today.

00:22:16.793 --> 00:22:17.993
I almost banged my head there.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.920
Thank you.

00:22:23.673 --> 00:22:24.673
It's not what you think.

00:22:24.807 --> 00:22:25.807
I just…

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.520
Lynx.

00:22:28.293 --> 00:22:29.293
Lynx!

00:22:30.627 --> 00:22:33.266
So what do I do

00:22:33.699 --> 00:22:35.000
to make Lynx and...

00:22:36.393 --> 00:22:39.713
I mean, to make two cats get along?

00:22:39.887 --> 00:22:41.326
Cats are like humans.

00:22:41.826 --> 00:22:43.899
You need to help them
build good memories together.

00:22:46.773 --> 00:22:47.906
For example,

00:22:48.186 --> 00:22:50.013
whenever they meet,

00:22:50.733 --> 00:22:52.719
let them eat something tasty together.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.213
Thank you so much, Doc.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.613
I'll treat you to a meal sometime.

00:23:23.506 --> 00:23:24.613
What are you doing?

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.306
I'm just trying to memorize

00:23:27.686 --> 00:23:29.800
how intense your scent is,

00:23:30.566 --> 00:23:32.366
so I don't mix you up
with someone else again.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.620
No need.

00:23:34.666 --> 00:23:36.013
I'll change it.

00:23:36.527 --> 00:23:38.247
I don't like using
the same thing as others.

00:23:38.513 --> 00:23:39.813
Are you still mad at Leo?

00:23:39.853 --> 00:23:40.853
Who's mad?

00:23:43.967 --> 00:23:45.906
I'm a good big brother.

00:23:46.593 --> 00:23:47.713
Why would I be mad?

00:23:47.819 --> 00:23:48.820
That's good then.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.006
This Saturday's my birthday.

00:23:53.167 --> 00:23:54.833
How about a party,
just the three of us?

00:23:54.912 --> 00:23:55.912
No!

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.933
Didn't you just say you weren't mad?

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.060
Well…

00:24:02.513 --> 00:24:03.920
you want a birthday party?

00:24:04.407 --> 00:24:05.626
Have you been a good boy yet?

00:24:15.613 --> 00:24:17.093
I really have.

00:24:17.587 --> 00:24:18.720
If you don't believe me,

00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:20.999
why don't you ask
Granny Juu to pick a card?

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:25.580
This card?

00:24:29.526 --> 00:24:30.526
The Tower.

00:24:32.207 --> 00:24:34.540
The Tower card means falling apart.

00:24:35.693 --> 00:24:38.620
I think your birthday plan
is not gonna happen.

00:24:41.912 --> 00:24:43.593
But I don't believe in this kind of thing.

00:24:44.679 --> 00:24:46.513
You pick the place for this Saturday.

00:24:47.607 --> 00:24:48.607
I'll pay.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:53.780
Okay.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.820
This good boy…

00:24:56.593 --> 00:24:57.926
will go scoop the litter now.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.480
You two seem close.

00:25:10.513 --> 00:25:11.533
Are you dating?

00:25:15.187 --> 00:25:16.187
No.

00:25:17.933 --> 00:25:19.460
But he seems to have feelings for you.

00:25:19.979 --> 00:25:20.979
I know.

00:25:25.453 --> 00:25:26.513
But do you know

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.733
Tiger… is totally my type?

00:25:32.746 --> 00:25:34.020
I think I know that too.

00:25:34.913 --> 00:25:36.320
Since you two aren't together yet,

00:25:39.027 --> 00:25:40.053
can I flirt with him?

00:25:43.087 --> 00:25:44.100
Go take your shot.

00:25:51.132 --> 00:25:52.220
If I win him over,

00:25:52.533 --> 00:25:53.806
I hope you'll be okay with it.

00:25:59.273 --> 00:26:00.606
But if you fail,

00:26:01.759 --> 00:26:02.980
I hope you'll be okay with it.

00:26:21.493 --> 00:26:23.100
Can you teach me how to make coffee?

00:26:23.793 --> 00:26:25.426
I wanna be useful around here,
like Lynx.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.720
Sure.

00:26:34.113 --> 00:26:35.113
What?

00:26:35.326 --> 00:26:36.393
My dear brother Leo,

00:26:37.327 --> 00:26:38.813
why didn't you tell me?

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.706
I can teach you myself.

00:26:46.713 --> 00:26:48.906
This thing is called a portafilter.

00:26:49.339 --> 00:26:50.773
You put the coffee grounds in here.

00:26:51.872 --> 00:26:55.213
This is the milk steamer.

00:26:56.259 --> 00:26:57.780
You turn it like this when you use it.

00:26:59.073 --> 00:27:00.073
Ouch!

00:27:00.433 --> 00:27:01.433
Lynx.

00:27:01.666 --> 00:27:02.466
Are you okay?

00:27:02.587 --> 00:27:03.387
I burnt my hand.

00:27:03.478 --> 00:27:04.833
I didn't know it'd be this hot.

00:27:09.513 --> 00:27:10.906
Ow, ow, ow.

00:27:15.313 --> 00:27:16.313
You okay now?

00:27:28.405 --> 00:27:30.712
Looks like it's gonna rain today.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:32.392
How do you know?

00:27:32.586 --> 00:27:33.828
The weather department said so?

00:27:35.017 --> 00:27:36.017
No.

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:37.525
I meant you.

00:27:38.419 --> 00:27:40.419
You usually never come out here
and help like this.

00:27:42.481 --> 00:27:44.410
It's your birthday month.

00:27:45.924 --> 00:27:47.614
Consider it a special treatment from me.

00:27:48.781 --> 00:27:49.781
Really?

00:27:50.118 --> 00:27:51.222
I thought…

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.292
you were trying to gatekeep me
from getting near Leo.

00:27:56.498 --> 00:27:57.538
Gatekeep who?

00:27:58.475 --> 00:27:59.926
Do I even have the right to do that?

00:28:00.117 --> 00:28:01.305
We're not a thing.

00:28:02.365 --> 00:28:03.365
Good.

00:28:04.466 --> 00:28:07.241
Because I don't wanna fight
with you about it later.

00:28:08.901 --> 00:28:09.901
Why?

00:28:10.407 --> 00:28:11.514
Do you like my brother?

00:28:16.537 --> 00:28:17.625
Why are you quiet?

00:28:23.064 --> 00:28:24.064
Mr. Tiger.

00:28:30.074 --> 00:28:31.800
If you're afraid of losing to your brother,

00:28:35.278 --> 00:28:36.409
how about we start dating?

00:28:49.513 --> 00:28:50.525
What are you saying?

00:28:54.469 --> 00:28:55.469
Hm?

00:28:56.052 --> 00:28:57.052
Lynx.

00:28:57.705 --> 00:28:58.763
A guy's calling you.

00:29:06.264 --> 00:29:07.296
It's my friend.

00:29:21.655 --> 00:29:22.724
Hello. What's up?

00:29:22.798 --> 00:29:23.598
(Hey, Lynx.)

00:29:23.699 --> 00:29:26.712
(I accidentally took on two jobs
at the same time.)

00:29:26.827 --> 00:29:28.429
(Can you cover one for me?)

00:29:28.879 --> 00:29:31.529
Come on, I told you
I stopped taking interpreter jobs.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:32.679
Find someone else.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.704
(But the client
specifically asked for you.)

00:29:34.997 --> 00:29:36.826
(I really don't want to lose this contact.)

00:29:37.402 --> 00:29:39.715
(It's Friday to Sunday in Chiang Mai.)

00:29:39.982 --> 00:29:41.546
(The weather is really nice right now.)

00:29:42.711 --> 00:29:44.811
This Saturday?

00:29:45.567 --> 00:29:46.912
I'm not available on Saturday.

00:29:46.959 --> 00:29:48.523
I can take care of the café for you.

00:29:48.718 --> 00:29:51.371
- You can take that job.
- (Thanks so much! I'll send you the details.)

00:29:51.395 --> 00:29:53.408
Hey, hold on. Hey!

00:29:59.021 --> 00:30:00.183
Is this how you want to play?

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.016
What's going on?

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.197
Lynx's friend called

00:30:15.883 --> 00:30:17.710
asking him to cover a job this Saturday.

00:30:17.837 --> 00:30:19.762
So I volunteered to look after
the café for him.

00:30:21.493 --> 00:30:22.513
But I don't know why…

00:30:23.596 --> 00:30:25.266
he got mad at me.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.860
Are you really going to try that line?

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.480
Leo.

00:30:35.126 --> 00:30:36.129
Can you give us a minute?

00:30:36.443 --> 00:30:37.496
I'll talk to him.

00:30:51.828 --> 00:30:53.210
He did that on purpose.

00:30:53.424 --> 00:30:55.002
He knew Saturday was your birthday.

00:30:59.249 --> 00:31:00.296
Don't worry about it.

00:31:02.609 --> 00:31:04.015
Go help your friend.

00:31:05.835 --> 00:31:09.218
My birthday party can wait.

00:31:12.453 --> 00:31:16.467
Don't fight with your brother
over something so trivial.

00:31:38.687 --> 00:31:39.700
What are you doing?

00:31:40.403 --> 00:31:41.247
That's kinda cute.

00:31:41.341 --> 00:31:42.898
We've got this little
gimmick for customers.

00:31:42.922 --> 00:31:45.011
We add a cat sticker and a nice message.

00:31:47.218 --> 00:31:48.320
Can you write one for me?

00:31:48.848 --> 00:31:49.888
Make it really sweet.

00:31:51.514 --> 00:31:52.514
Sure.

00:32:57.298 --> 00:32:58.298
Tiger.

00:32:59.805 --> 00:33:00.805
Tiger!

00:33:04.303 --> 00:33:05.322
Cat overdose.

00:33:05.436 --> 00:33:06.886
I need to step outside for some air.

00:33:24.221 --> 00:33:25.835
You're actually pretty good at your job.

00:33:26.142 --> 00:33:27.662
Have you ever worked part-time before?

00:33:29.035 --> 00:33:30.217
I've done everything.

00:33:31.137 --> 00:33:33.725
A kid with no parents like me?

00:33:35.537 --> 00:33:37.457
I had to survive on my own,
any damn way I could.

00:33:43.191 --> 00:33:44.191
Want one?

00:33:49.043 --> 00:33:50.929
Nah. I quit.

00:33:52.823 --> 00:33:53.823
Come on.

00:33:54.996 --> 00:33:56.318
It's just us here.

00:33:59.078 --> 00:34:00.306
I won't tell Lynx.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.130
Hey!

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:22.718
The cats here hate cigarette smells.

00:34:24.298 --> 00:34:25.594
If you want to stay here,

00:34:26.601 --> 00:34:27.708
follow the rules.

00:34:47.081 --> 00:34:48.303
Why are we closing early?

00:34:48.617 --> 00:34:49.803
It's not closing time yet.

00:34:52.103 --> 00:34:53.814
We've got a VIP customer

00:34:54.115 --> 00:34:55.414
booking a birthday party.

00:34:58.611 --> 00:34:59.697
We do?

00:35:06.207 --> 00:35:07.709
Happy birthday, Tiger.

00:35:22.947 --> 00:35:24.298
No cat's stopping you

00:35:24.739 --> 00:35:26.092
from drinking beer, right?

00:35:30.757 --> 00:35:31.760
I never said no.

00:35:45.043 --> 00:35:46.216
Just invite me too.

00:36:12.715 --> 00:36:13.715
Lynx.

00:36:14.762 --> 00:36:16.027
Why are you back early?

00:36:16.454 --> 00:36:18.106
I thought you'd be back tomorrow morning.

00:36:18.442 --> 00:36:19.918
My work finished early,

00:36:20.265 --> 00:36:21.723
so I wanted to come home to surprise you.

00:36:21.747 --> 00:36:22.747
Surprise?

00:36:23.551 --> 00:36:24.751
That wasn't a surprise at all.

00:36:26.462 --> 00:36:27.262
Lynx.

00:36:27.314 --> 00:36:28.114
Leo.

00:36:28.222 --> 00:36:30.214
We've got a bunch of games for a party.

00:36:30.327 --> 00:36:33.367
This group of games is called Clingy
Cats, perfect to play when you're drunk.

00:36:38.686 --> 00:36:41.211
The first game is truth or dare.

00:36:41.945 --> 00:36:44.696
You have to do
whatever the card says.

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:47.226
If you refuse,
you drink the whole can.

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:48.660
I'll go first.

00:36:50.121 --> 00:36:51.121
Granny Juu,

00:36:51.747 --> 00:36:53.881
I dare you to pet someone's head

00:36:54.324 --> 00:36:55.804
like they're a kitten.

00:37:04.939 --> 00:37:05.956
Next up, Leo.

00:37:07.176 --> 00:37:09.720
I dare you to scratch someone's chin.

00:37:11.567 --> 00:37:13.819
Excuse me, Tiger.

00:37:17.652 --> 00:37:19.005
I dare you to

00:37:19.378 --> 00:37:21.318
rub your head against someone,

00:37:22.408 --> 00:37:23.514
just like a kitten.

00:37:36.094 --> 00:37:37.523
This is getting kinda awkward.

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:39.713
Let's switch games.

00:37:40.099 --> 00:37:41.099
Next game,

00:37:41.565 --> 00:37:42.685
Shedding Cats.

00:37:43.266 --> 00:37:44.266
Go!

00:37:45.262 --> 00:37:46.120
Leo, your back.

00:37:46.207 --> 00:37:47.372
Lynx, your tummy.

00:37:47.399 --> 00:37:49.599
There's more on the back.
They're still there, trust me.

00:37:50.002 --> 00:37:51.625
Come on, Lynx, almost there.

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.140
It's a tie.

00:37:57.968 --> 00:37:58.968
Next game,

00:37:59.027 --> 00:38:00.027
Soju Bomb.

00:38:02.305 --> 00:38:04.310
First one to finish wins.

00:38:16.128 --> 00:38:17.128
Next game,

00:38:17.348 --> 00:38:18.794
Cookie Face.

00:38:19.095 --> 00:38:20.775
First one to get it into their mouth wins.

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:21.965
Go!

00:38:33.335 --> 00:38:35.026
Yeahhh!

00:38:40.191 --> 00:38:41.320
Alright, last game.

00:38:41.646 --> 00:38:42.720
Cup Tower.

00:38:43.092 --> 00:38:45.620
Stack the cups as high as you can
without using your hands.

00:38:46.596 --> 00:38:47.596
Got it?

00:38:47.791 --> 00:38:49.504
You talk too much. Get down.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.002
Ouch.

00:38:51.525 --> 00:38:52.325
Start.

00:38:52.453 --> 00:38:53.498
Come on, Lynx.

00:39:00.232 --> 00:39:01.232
Hey!

00:39:01.377 --> 00:39:03.177
You knocked mine over, Leo!

00:39:07.484 --> 00:39:08.510
Hurry up, Lynx.

00:39:12.716 --> 00:39:13.816
Put it properly.

00:39:15.362 --> 00:39:17.700
Come on, Leo. It's the last one.

00:39:18.531 --> 00:39:19.412
Let's do this together.

00:39:19.439 --> 00:39:20.239
What?

00:39:20.428 --> 00:39:21.473
Why do I have to help you?

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:22.662
I'm your friggin' brother.

00:39:22.729 --> 00:39:23.927
Just do whatever I tell you.

00:39:24.436 --> 00:39:25.436
Get over here.

00:39:26.063 --> 00:39:27.063
Hey!

00:39:35.085 --> 00:39:36.983
Yeah!!!!

00:39:40.188 --> 00:39:42.617
Argh.

00:39:45.233 --> 00:39:50.266
So this is what
Granny Juu's Tower card meant.

00:40:10.533 --> 00:40:11.533
Lynx.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.020
Lynx.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.560
Lynx.

00:40:14.853 --> 00:40:15.926
Want to go sleep upstairs?

00:40:17.233 --> 00:40:18.233
Lynx.

00:40:24.667 --> 00:40:25.667
Leo.

00:40:25.966 --> 00:40:26.966
Leo.

00:40:27.493 --> 00:40:28.592
Want to go sleep upstairs?

00:40:29.433 --> 00:40:30.233
Leo.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.340
Hm?

00:40:37.147 --> 00:40:38.147
Come on.

00:40:38.839 --> 00:40:39.839
Let's go.

00:40:44.873 --> 00:40:45.906
You okay, Leo?

00:40:55.153 --> 00:40:56.153
Careful, Leo.

00:40:59.339 --> 00:41:00.339
Tiger.

00:41:19.566 --> 00:41:21.113
Can I go into Mom's room?

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.160
Why Mom?

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.193
I promised you…

00:42:23.827 --> 00:42:25.406
I'd bring you my diploma.

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.613
Why didn't you wait for me?

00:42:42.433 --> 00:42:43.826
Didn't you say…

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.126
we'd take photos together?

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.526
You didn't even give me
a chance to say goodbye.

If you're worried about your brother,

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:34.620
go talk to him.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:46.706
Can you stand on your own?

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:58.506
Can you take me?

00:45:35.027 --> 00:45:37.620
Yuck, you smell like cigarettes.

00:45:39.667 --> 00:45:43.793
But this smell is what tells you

00:45:44.325 --> 00:45:45.906
you're not alone anymore.

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:12.980
Get some rest.

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.306
You've had a long day.

00:46:37.693 --> 00:46:38.720
Happy birthday.

00:46:40.093 --> 00:46:41.093
Thank you.

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:47.420
So… where's my gift?

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.300
Do you…

00:46:55.193 --> 00:46:56.433
want to caress my head?

00:47:04.465 --> 00:47:05.600
Would that be okay with you?

00:47:09.184 --> 00:47:10.184
Why not?

00:47:13.986 --> 00:47:15.526
You could do that with Leo.

00:47:18.486 --> 00:47:19.706
It's not the same.

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:27.110
You like Leo?

00:47:31.972 --> 00:47:34.533
Just tell me. I won't be mad.

00:47:37.186 --> 00:47:38.333
When I like someone,

00:47:41.746 --> 00:47:42.826
this is what I do.

00:48:35.526 --> 00:48:36.526
Thank you

00:48:37.866 --> 00:48:39.013

(Next Episode) Mom once planned a trip to
search for cats around Korat with friends.

00:49:05.032 --> 00:49:06.206
But she never got to go…

00:49:06.407 --> 00:49:08.087
Since we're already here,

00:49:08.607 --> 00:49:10.207
how about we go find those cats for her?

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:12.313
You still owe me a date, remember?

00:49:13.193 --> 00:49:14.326
Can I ask you something?

00:49:15.287 --> 00:49:16.820
Why do you want to be my boyfriend?

00:49:19.613 --> 00:49:22.626
When you want a cat, do you need a reason?

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.952
If you want to embrace
me, you can't be just anyone.
