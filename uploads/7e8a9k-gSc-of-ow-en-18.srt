1
00:00:54,863 --> 00:00:56,429
I came here to give you this.

2
00:00:58,152 --> 00:00:59,237
You left it.

3
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:00,721
I meant to leave that behind.

4
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,068
Does that apply to me, too?

5
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:03,832
I can’t get you out of my head.

6
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,565
In that case—

7
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:08,849
Why am I even here?

8
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:10,140
Cut!

9
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:11,964
It’s terrible!

10
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,908
Damn it! Arkin,
what is happening to you?

11
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,160
Miss Clea?
You’re called on set.

12
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:17,185
Okay.

13
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:19,834
Sir Larkin, it’s time to change
for the next scene.

14
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:20,859
Okay.

15
00:01:20,884 --> 00:01:21,884
Thank you.

16
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,977
One more!

17
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:49,718
Wait.

18
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:50,746
Here.

19
00:01:56,075 --> 00:02:00,483
Via, you should
also visit Auntie Allie.

20
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:01,604
They miss you.

21
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:04,862
How can I visit
if Arkin’s there too?

22
00:02:05,768 --> 00:02:08,011
We need to finish
all the sequences

23
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:10,247
since we won’t have
a shoot until next week.

24
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,048
Here.

25
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,781
Looks like the
rain is getting heavy.

26
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:20,099
All right. I’ll visit
on the weekend.

27
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,452
Come on, let’s go
to the mall now.

28
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,534
Get ready, take a shower.

29
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:29,458
I’ll need to buy a gift
to take to Auntie Allie.

30
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,568
- Okay, okay, let’s go!
- Okay, Via.

31
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:31,769
Let’s go.

32
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,662
- Via!
- Hi, Auntie.

33
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,663
Come in.

34
00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:47,476
What brings you here?
It’s been a while!

35
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,295
Yes, I was just passing by,

36
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:51,130
and this is for you and Uncle.

37
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,381
Thank you. Wow.

38
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:56,821
Mira also mentioned
that you were looking for me.

39
00:02:56,846 --> 00:02:59,349
I always ask about
you from your dad.

40
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:00,917
It’s a pity
Uncle Orlan isn’t here.

41
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:02,767
Arkin isn’t here either.

42
00:03:05,573 --> 00:03:06,797
How was Spain?

43
00:03:06,822 --> 00:03:09,825
It’s been such a long time since
we last saw each other and talked.

44
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:11,420
Yes. I’m sorry, Auntie.

45
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:14,385
I wasn’t able to keep in touch.

46
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:15,890
Also…

47
00:03:16,216 --> 00:03:18,427
I felt a bit ashamed, too,

48
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:20,837
because we’re no longer a couple.

49
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:24,446
I understand, dear.
I know what you went through.

50
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:26,530
In fact,

51
00:03:27,612 --> 00:03:29,614
I should be
the one apologizing.

52
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:31,932
What you went
through was really hard.

53
00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:34,751
And Arkin didn’t
tell us anything and

54
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:35,799
you know how he is.

55
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:39,411
Whenever he has problems,
you’re the only one he talks to.

56
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:43,793
Have you eaten?
Do you want snacks?

57
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:47,944
Yes, please.

58
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:49,747
Okay, come.
I’ll make you something.

59
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:50,795
Okay, thank you.

60
00:03:53,074 --> 00:03:55,810
I’m sure he’ll finish
his shoot late,

61
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,671
so I’ll just leave
early instead.

62
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:06,029
I’m so happy that
you’re doing well.

63
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:10,643
You know, I had to ask
Arkin to leave the agency.

64
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:13,414
So he has a new agency
and management now,

65
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,942
and he’s much happier
and really thriving.

66
00:04:18,249 --> 00:04:19,918
But I actually feel guilty.

67
00:04:21,255 --> 00:04:23,048
As a mother,
I should have known.

68
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,590
But that’s Arkin for you.

69
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:28,635
He kept everything
to himself and—

70
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,349
It was only after you
left that he finally told us.

71
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:37,644
That he really could
not take it anymore.

72
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:41,507
Auntie, I’m sorry.

73
00:04:41,936 --> 00:04:44,105
I’m sorry I was not
able to stay by his side.

74
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:47,572
Even though I said before
that I would never leave him.

75
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:48,866
I’m sorry.

76
00:04:49,926 --> 00:04:53,971
Via, I know that
leaving him was the...

77
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:55,876
hardest decision of your life.

78
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:59,369
But you know that it
made him a better person.

79
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:04,303
He learned how to stand
on his own two feet.

80
00:05:05,353 --> 00:05:08,272
He’s more mature,
more responsible.

81
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:11,923
He’s no longer the
innocent boy I raised.

82
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:16,074
He knows a lot now.

83
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:18,142
He understands
how the industry works.

84
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:21,750
And he’s now enrolled
in film in Diliman.

85
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:24,560
He’s already in his third year.
He’s close to graduating.

86
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,953
Don’t neglect yourself, don’t
neglect your studies, okay?

87
00:05:31,155 --> 00:05:33,950
Being a director is still
your real dream, right?

88
00:05:34,593 --> 00:05:35,623
Via, I’m sorry.

89
00:05:35,648 --> 00:05:38,443
I can’t handle both acting
and school at the same time.

90
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,707
That’s why my manager
had me stop attending school.

91
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,712
So there’s no need to worry
about Arkin anymore.

92
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:47,695
He’s doing well on his own.

93
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:50,052
He’s handling
everything by himself.

94
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:54,318
That’s good.

95
00:05:57,627 --> 00:06:02,420
Via, I know he
loved you so much.

96
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:06,929
And even though
you’re no longer together,

97
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:09,819
I hope you can still
be civil with each other.

98
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,306
It’s just a shame,
because you were

99
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,712
together longer than
you were apart.

100
00:06:16,398 --> 00:06:18,149
That’s what I want, too.

101
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,972
But I can’t blame Arkin
if he doesn’t want to,

102
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:22,285
or if he’s angry with me.

103
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,660
Something happened between us,
and I left him the next day.

104
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:30,554
I don’t know how
to apologize for that.

105
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:33,074
That was so selfish of me.

106
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:35,935
I think your
Uncle Orlan is here.

107
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:38,269
Ma, I’m here.

108
00:06:43,897 --> 00:06:45,148
Arkin…

109
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:50,944
What are you doing here?

110
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,713
I was just visiting Auntie.

111
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:56,827
Auntie, I’ll get going now.

112
00:06:57,432 --> 00:06:59,059
Why didn’t you tell me, Ma?

113
00:06:59,698 --> 00:07:02,534
I didn’t know you’d be
coming home early.

114
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,770
Don’t worry,
I’m leaving anyway.

115
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:06,918
Go on, then. Leave.

116
00:07:06,943 --> 00:07:08,423
Yes, I really am leaving. Bye.

117
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:09,484
Wait a second.

118
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:10,710
Where’s my umbrella?

119
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:12,966
I don’t have it.

120
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:15,193
Ma, it’s the umbrella
you gave me.

121
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:16,495
She might have already lost it.

122
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,531
Ma, talk to her.

123
00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:20,281
What do you mean?
Of course, it’s not lost.

124
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,976
I’ll return it to you, don’t worry.
I’ll bring it here.

125
00:07:23,257 --> 00:07:24,717
What am I supposed
to do with it?

126
00:07:24,742 --> 00:07:25,742
Arkin—

127
00:07:26,063 --> 00:07:27,689
Please don’t argue.

128
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:30,560
It’s fine.

129
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:32,490
I’ll just get it from you
some other day.

130
00:07:33,946 --> 00:07:35,231
Some other day?

131
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:37,730
Does that mean we’ll
see each other again?

132
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,594
Never mind. Wouldn’t
wanna bother you.

133
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:44,163
I’ll return it here
when you’re not around.

134
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,168
Auntie, I’ll get going now.

135
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,420
Visit me again, okay?

136
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,505
Yes, it was nice seeing you.

137
00:07:54,882 --> 00:07:56,801
Go see her to the door.

138
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:58,261
- Bye, Auntie.
- Bye.

139
00:07:58,338 --> 00:07:59,387
Are you gonna pass through?

140
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:01,514
- Excuse me.
- At least see her to the door.

141
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:03,603
She doesn’t want to, take care.

142
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,684
Right.

143
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:06,019
Auntie, bye.

144
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,520
- Bye.
- Bye!

145
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:09,134
Take care.

146
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:11,150
Bye, Auntie. Bye.

147
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:12,217
Go on now.

148
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:16,642
You miss her, huh?

149
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:19,459
Come on, Ma.

150
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:22,013
Have some snacks.

151
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:23,964
Ensaymada.

152
00:08:29,063 --> 00:08:30,898
This is for you.

153
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:38,342
Arkin—

154
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:40,928
Your umbrella.

155
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:45,644
You can keep it.

156
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:46,869
I don’t need it anymore.

157
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:49,603
Wait.

158
00:08:49,636 --> 00:08:50,637
Here.

159
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:37,419
Via?

160
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,005
Dan!

161
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:41,609
You’re here, too?

162
00:10:42,282 --> 00:10:43,909
- May I?
- Yeah, of course.

163
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,423
How are you?

164
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:47,847
I just transferred today.

165
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:49,415
Wait, you’re back home already?

166
00:10:50,474 --> 00:10:53,519
Just temporarily.
I’m part of the Airport Project in Bulacan.

167
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:54,959
Me, too.

168
00:10:55,348 --> 00:10:56,372
Really?

169
00:10:56,397 --> 00:10:57,607
- Yeah.
- That’s nice.

170
00:10:57,607 --> 00:10:59,025
So we’ll actually be working together.

171
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,526
Before, we only worked together
on school projects.

172
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:04,387
Yeah. I’m looking forward to
working with you, Architect Diaz.

173
00:11:04,412 --> 00:11:06,414
Same here, Architect Morales.

174
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,537
So, how’s Spain?

175
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,046
Will you go back there after the project?

176
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:16,642
Spain? Spain’s really good.

177
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:19,086
Spain’s great,
and my work there is really good too.

178
00:11:19,331 --> 00:11:21,239
So, yes, I’ll go back there.

179
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:25,351
Uh...

180
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,380
How about you?
How are you both doing?

181
00:11:32,923 --> 00:11:33,923
Um...

182
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,563
We’re okay, I guess?

183
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:39,069
Civil.

184
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:43,027
And I didn’t come here for him.

185
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:49,906
Clea’s still really beautiful, isn’t she?

186
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:54,914
Yeah. Of course. Clea’s still beautiful.

187
00:11:55,312 --> 00:11:57,147
I’m the one working on her house.

188
00:11:57,286 --> 00:11:58,286
Really?

189
00:11:58,356 --> 00:12:00,676
Make sure to take me with you
next time you go to the site.

190
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:06,924
You’re still a huge fanboy
of Clea Aguilar, huh?

191
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:09,459
Clea? Clea Aguilar?

192
00:12:09,904 --> 00:12:12,990
Oh my gosh, she’s always in the office!

193
00:12:13,015 --> 00:12:15,170
Yeah, she’s really beautiful.

194
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,822
Are they still together,
Larkin Sanchez and her?

195
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:19,914
I’m not sure.

196
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,939
They’ve been keeping
a low profile for a long time.

197
00:12:21,964 --> 00:12:25,259
Now they’re back in the news
because of a new movie.

198
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:27,780
Wasn’t there an issue with Larkin before?

199
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:30,241
Something about another girlfriend?

200
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:33,452
That was supposedly
just a childhood friend.

201
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:37,819
Come on, Via, let’s go.
Let’s grab some snacks.

202
00:12:41,377 --> 00:12:45,298
On Saturday,
I’m going to Clea’s construction site.

203
00:12:45,372 --> 00:12:46,373
Want to come?

204
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,884
I’ll bring the car.

205
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:51,553
Let’s go.

206
00:13:01,517 --> 00:13:05,146
Larkin Sanchez and Clea Aguilar
are building a house together?

207
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:09,655
Aren’t you Clea’s architect?

208
00:13:10,865 --> 00:13:14,118
Is this true, Via?
Is that Clea’s and Arkin’s house?

209
00:13:15,225 --> 00:13:19,093
I don’t know.
All I know is that Clea is my client.

210
00:13:19,307 --> 00:13:22,835
So what if it’s true?
How would you feel?

211
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:26,087
Nothing.

212
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,479
Are they really dating off-camera?

213
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:35,185
Mira, I don’t know.

214
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,087
Larkin and I aren’t that close anymore.

215
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:42,476
Why don’t you just ask him?
I know you’re still close to him.

216
00:13:44,982 --> 00:13:45,982
Via,

217
00:13:46,776 --> 00:13:49,028
how did you get through
what happened between you two?

218
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,531
Wasn’t it hard?

219
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,823
Do you regret it?

220
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:05,920
It was hard.

221
00:14:07,755 --> 00:14:11,592
But you know, I don’t regret leaving.

222
00:14:12,176 --> 00:14:14,136
What I regret is

223
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,212
trading our friendship just for that.

224
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,708
Just for that?

225
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,251
Your relationship wasn’t “just that,” Via.

226
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:26,887
Even if you didn’t ruin your friendship,

227
00:14:27,306 --> 00:14:29,308
you were still in love with each other.

228
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,969
You can’t even call that friendship.

229
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:35,783
Wow.

230
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:39,662
You seem to know a lot about those things.

231
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,122
You got yourself a boyfriend?

232
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,974
Via, don’t just change
the topic like that.

233
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:47,086
But you changed the topic, too!

234
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:48,856
Whatever—

235
00:14:49,953 --> 00:14:51,246
Why are you smiling?

236
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:53,967
No reason.

237
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,886
I used to be like that too.

238
00:14:57,336 --> 00:15:00,673
Via! About the beach trip!
You’re still going, right?

239
00:15:01,227 --> 00:15:03,245
Of course. Why wouldn’t I be?

240
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:06,861
- Well… Arkin’s coming.
- Huh? Why?

241
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,291
Sevi invited him.

242
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:13,151
And it’s kind of sad, too, since he hasn’t
hung out with the group in a long time.

243
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:15,229
Should I tell him not to come?

244
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,583
It’s fine, he’s part of the group anyway.

245
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:21,253
See you, Via. No backing out!
Love you!

246
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:22,803
Love you, too.

247
00:15:23,976 --> 00:15:28,188
Via! Sorry,
can you pick me up at Arkin’s place?

248
00:15:28,234 --> 00:15:33,869
Our music lesson might run late.
It’ll be hard to get a ride. Please?

249
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:36,559
Right there.

250
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,432
Hi, Auntie.

251
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:42,625
Hi.

252
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:45,870
Have some snacks.

253
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:48,165
The fried noodles are really good,
and the rice cakes too.

254
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:49,833
Thank you.

255
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,109
What about Aidan?

256
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,296
Didn’t he use the guitar?

257
00:15:54,507 --> 00:15:57,385
Oh, when he got here he wanted
to play the piano first.

258
00:15:57,573 --> 00:16:00,451
Now he’s upstairs playing the drums.

259
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:03,371
Wait, I have to go.
I have a meeting.

260
00:16:03,554 --> 00:16:04,889
- Make sure you eat, okay?
- Okay.

261
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:06,290
- Thank you.
- I’ll see you later.

262
00:16:13,964 --> 00:16:16,217
Hurry up. I’m downstairs.

263
00:16:25,477 --> 00:16:31,560
A glimpse of you in the middle
of the silence.

264
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:39,686
Listening to the pulse of what I’m feeling.

265
00:16:42,094 --> 00:16:43,094
What was that?

266
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:45,415
You write songs now?

267
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,216
No. Nothing. It just came out.

268
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:52,068
Where’s Aidan?

269
00:16:52,654 --> 00:16:53,806
He’s in the music room.

270
00:16:57,971 --> 00:16:59,514
Are you ready to go for it again, Via?

271
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:03,635
I think music is really meant for you.

272
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:05,426
You should try it.

273
00:17:05,803 --> 00:17:09,056
I’ll help you. Writing songs, producing…

274
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,567
Have you visited your mom again?

275
00:17:22,112 --> 00:17:23,197
You should go see her.

276
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:25,869
I can go with you if you want.

277
00:17:26,554 --> 00:17:29,265
I mean, I have some free time in the next—

278
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,773
Don’t interfere in my life, Larkin.

279
00:17:34,277 --> 00:17:36,311
You’re no longer in a position to do that.

280
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,891
I’m sorry.

281
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,586
Stop forcing me into
your world, Larkin.

282
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:48,431
I’ve been broken for a long time, and I
never want to go back to your world again.

283
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:52,148
Via, come on.

284
00:17:53,587 --> 00:17:55,932
I’m still not okay, Larkin.

285
00:17:57,871 --> 00:18:02,448
And I’d rather live in a world where
I’m not happy, but I’m not sad either.

286
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,245
I will never put myself out there in front
of so many people again.

287
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:12,057
I’m more afraid now.

288
00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:14,791
I’m more afraid now than before,
because of you.

289
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:18,505
So you have no right
to tell me to try,

290
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,408
when you’re the one who opened my wounds
and made them bleed.

291
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,728
Is that all I am to you, Via?

292
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:38,915
After all the years we were together,

293
00:18:41,563 --> 00:18:43,280
is that the only memory I left you with?

294
00:18:50,704 --> 00:18:52,665
Do you regret meeting me?

295
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:14,770
Maybe it really would’ve been better…

296
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:18,827
Maybe it would’ve been
better if we never met.

297
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:24,872
Wow.

298
00:19:27,852 --> 00:19:29,562
I guess I was wrong about us.

299
00:19:33,682 --> 00:19:35,392
Let’s not see each other again.

300
00:19:35,686 --> 00:19:36,686
Ever.

301
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:07,840
Oh my gosh! I don’t know what to bring.
This brown swimsuit?

302
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:10,075
Or this red one?

303
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:11,510
It’s so pretty!

304
00:20:11,535 --> 00:20:12,577
Or this black one?

305
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:15,247
Should I just bring them all?

306
00:20:16,331 --> 00:20:18,417
You’re really bringing
three bikinis?

307
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:19,974
How many outfit changes
are you planning to do there?

308
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:23,002
Of course! I’ll need
them for photos.

309
00:20:23,027 --> 00:20:24,131
Oh, this one’s mine.

310
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,199
I bought it in Thailand.

311
00:20:25,382 --> 00:20:28,302
- See?
- Wow, that’s so nice. So fancy!

312
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,026
It looks good on you, Yanna.

313
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,152
You’ll look so sexy.

314
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:36,137
Via, what swimwear are
you gonna bring?

315
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:39,354
This one.

316
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,024
Just this.

317
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:43,667
Huh?

318
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:45,736
Why are you wearing
a rash guard?

319
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:48,155
No! That won’t look
good in pictures.

320
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:52,451
I don’t really have a bikini.

321
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,278
Didn’t Sam give you
a bikini as a gift?

322
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:58,749
Come on, guys, just let
Via wear what she wants.

323
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,393
Via, whatever you wear,
you’ll still look cute.

324
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:04,098
But if you wanna wear
the swimsuit I got for you,

325
00:21:04,123 --> 00:21:05,397
take a photo, okay?

326
00:21:05,422 --> 00:21:06,799
I wanna see!

327
00:21:06,824 --> 00:21:08,909
Jeez, Sam.
Just come home already.

328
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:10,761
Seriously, before Via leaves,

329
00:21:10,786 --> 00:21:12,056
this is gonna be the
last time we get to bond.

330
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,224
Yeah, when are you
planning to come back?

331
00:21:16,402 --> 00:21:19,215
I don’t know yet.
Are the guys going, too?

332
00:21:21,563 --> 00:21:23,774
Of course. They’re coming, too.

333
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,576
Good luck, then.

334
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:30,074
Babe, can you get
my other bikini, please?

335
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:31,381
Damn it!

336
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:33,575
Why are you saying
that out loud?

337
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:35,369
Let’s evict Yanna.

338
00:21:35,786 --> 00:21:37,246
She’s being all cutesy again.

339
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,873
The bitter ones
should just stay quiet!

340
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:43,292
Bye!

341
00:21:43,627 --> 00:21:44,628
Take care, guys.

342
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,021
Bye!

343
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:47,549
Bye, guys!

344
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:22,027
Wait.

345
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:25,978
Oh my god.

346
00:22:26,003 --> 00:22:27,212
It’s a beach.

347
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:34,845
Come on now!

348
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,140
Hi, guys!

349
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,158
You guys took so long.

350
00:22:40,183 --> 00:22:41,724
- These are so heavy.
- Sevi, give that to me.

351
00:22:41,749 --> 00:22:43,263
- I’ll carry my stuff.
- No. No, it’s okay.

352
00:22:43,604 --> 00:22:46,607
Hey, bro, you carry this.
Make yourself useful.

353
00:22:46,607 --> 00:22:47,816
I’m carrying a lot.

354
00:22:48,692 --> 00:22:50,313
What are you talking about?

355
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:53,213
Did you forget that you were the one
who kept pushing me to come here?

356
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,324
You said she wouldn’t be here.
Why is she here?

357
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,409
If I had known,
I wouldn’t have come.

358
00:22:58,452 --> 00:23:00,787
Well, it’s an honor
to have you with us.

359
00:23:00,787 --> 00:23:03,123
- Exactly.
- Thank you.

360
00:23:03,373 --> 00:23:04,853
I’m sorry.
I only had free time today.

361
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,520
I could use some vacation.

362
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,962
Damn! He’s speaking English!

363
00:23:09,546 --> 00:23:11,089
I’ll twist that tongue of yours.

364
00:23:11,114 --> 00:23:13,617
The way you speak,
we’d think you’re not crude.

365
00:23:13,884 --> 00:23:16,136
- Why so fancy, bro?
- Why so fancy?

366
00:23:16,136 --> 00:23:17,136
Screw you.

367
00:23:17,821 --> 00:23:20,991
Girls, this is the
suite Hiro booked.

368
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:22,184
- One for you.
- Oh, thank you.

369
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:23,852
Yanna, please tell Hiro

370
00:23:23,852 --> 00:23:25,764
thanks for treating us
to the accommodation, okay?

371
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:27,105
Of course. Oh my gosh.

372
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,231
Is ours the penthouse?

373
00:23:28,231 --> 00:23:29,733
I’m with a celebrity, you know.

374
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:31,902
And as thanks,
let us borrow Avi for a bit.

375
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:33,011
We’ll take care of her.

376
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:34,988
You can think about that later.

377
00:23:35,072 --> 00:23:36,073
Let’s just go now.

378
00:23:36,073 --> 00:23:37,240
I’m dying to swim.

379
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,584
- Come on!
- Let’s go!

380
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,162
Let’s go, guys!

381
00:23:42,663 --> 00:23:44,081
- Having fun yet?
- Wait for me.

382
00:23:44,081 --> 00:23:45,499
Come on.

383
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:49,877
Ouch!

384
00:23:56,677 --> 00:23:58,136
Is this okay?

385
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,575
What if it doesn’t suit me?

386
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,901
Send it to Sam.

387
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:14,236
You’re so pretty!

388
00:24:14,236 --> 00:24:15,339
Is it okay?

389
00:24:15,364 --> 00:24:17,102
- Is that the one Sam gave you?
- It’s nice.

390
00:24:17,127 --> 00:24:18,006
Yes.

391
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,636
- You’re wearing it!
- It’s so pretty.

392
00:24:20,663 --> 00:24:21,760
Oh, hold on.

393
00:24:21,785 --> 00:24:24,746
Can we open it?
Let’s show the world.

394
00:24:24,771 --> 00:24:25,771
Just one!

395
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:27,599
Just one, come on.

396
00:24:27,624 --> 00:24:28,875
Just one, I promise.

397
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:33,255
- Isn’t it—
- Oh my gosh!

398
00:24:33,463 --> 00:24:34,798
Doesn’t it look bad?

399
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,258
- What?
- What are you talking about?

400
00:24:36,283 --> 00:24:37,843
It’s so pretty, it suits you.
I promise!

401
00:24:37,926 --> 00:24:39,177
- You’re so pretty.
- It’s beautiful.

402
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:39,903
Right?

403
00:24:39,928 --> 00:24:41,972
And Sam will be happy
when she sees that,

404
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:43,625
so we’re taking pictures later.

405
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,725
Yes!

406
00:24:44,725 --> 00:24:46,184
Via, you’re beautiful. Seriously.

407
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,103
It really suits you, I swear.
I’m not talking crap.

408
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:49,146
You know what,

409
00:24:49,146 --> 00:24:52,649
I bet an ex is
going to regret it later!

410
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,735
Actually.

411
00:24:54,735 --> 00:24:56,403
- Right?
- For real.

412
00:24:56,403 --> 00:24:58,989
- Now, come on! Let’s go.
- I can’t wait.

413
00:24:58,989 --> 00:24:59,989
Let’s go.

414
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:05,537
Bro, this place is beautiful, huh?

415
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,362
Look at those rocks over there.

416
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,832
How did that get over there?

417
00:25:09,082 --> 00:25:11,126
- Here, look at this.
- What if we go there?

418
00:25:11,126 --> 00:25:12,461
- It’s Luna.
- Inflatable island.

419
00:25:12,461 --> 00:25:13,473
- Now, that’s nice.
- Inflatable island?

420
00:25:13,498 --> 00:25:14,506
Don’t post that!

421
00:25:14,531 --> 00:25:16,273
Fine, post it!
Our friendship’s over.

422
00:25:16,298 --> 00:25:17,522
Looks like you guys
are having so much fun.

423
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,761
We’ve been waiting for you guys.

424
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:24,556
- We’re here now.
- We’ve been waiting here for a while.

425
00:25:25,766 --> 00:25:27,100
What do you want to do?

426
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,694
Hey! Me, too.
Put some on me!

427
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,362
Huh? Wait your turn.

428
00:25:39,362 --> 00:25:40,383
Bro.

429
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:41,822
Bro.

430
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:45,107
I’ll put sunscreen on you, bro.

431
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:49,413
Bro.

432
00:25:59,382 --> 00:26:00,717
Such an idiot.

433
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,178
Come on, don’t be shy!

434
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:04,345
Turn around.

435
00:26:09,142 --> 00:26:10,393
You two are so sweet.

436
00:26:10,393 --> 00:26:11,436
Wow, a celebrity’s

437
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:14,481
- putting sunscreen on me.
- They’re the newest love team.

438
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:15,482
Take a video of us.

439
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:16,650
Here you go.

440
00:26:16,983 --> 00:26:19,212
- Let’s share it with everyone!
- A celebrity is putting sunscreen on me!

441
00:26:19,236 --> 00:26:20,963
- There, done.
- We can totally blackmail him now.

442
00:26:20,987 --> 00:26:22,541
- You go in front!
- Blackmail material.

443
00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:24,032
Okay.

444
00:26:24,032 --> 00:26:26,243
- Okay! Let’s just go there. Okay?
- That’s enough.

445
00:26:26,243 --> 00:26:26,868
Oh, yeah. Let’s go!

446
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:28,453
- So we’ll have somewhere nice to go.
- Shall we?

447
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:29,454
- Let’s go.
- Come on.

448
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:30,664
My phone!

449
00:26:30,664 --> 00:26:32,124
- What the heck?
- Wait!

450
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,125
I’m coming!

451
00:26:42,747 --> 00:26:43,747
Shit!

452
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:45,804
So hot!

453
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:46,471
Of course!

454
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:46,888
Hey!

455
00:26:47,264 --> 00:26:48,557
I just wanna smack you.

456
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:49,557
Here.

457
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:50,766
Try me!

458
00:26:51,852 --> 00:26:52,852
Here’s your towel.

459
00:26:53,937 --> 00:26:55,188
You’re really feeling yourself, huh?

460
00:26:55,188 --> 00:26:58,066
Oh my gosh. Kierra,
stop hurting him.

461
00:26:58,358 --> 00:27:00,068
He’s already heartbroken.

462
00:27:00,068 --> 00:27:02,279
Hey! Screw you, Luna.
Be quiet.

463
00:27:02,863 --> 00:27:04,030
- Screw you!
- Damn.

464
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,576
With a face like that,
you’re still single?

465
00:27:08,744 --> 00:27:09,744
You deserve it!

466
00:27:09,744 --> 00:27:10,744
Yes!

467
00:27:11,246 --> 00:27:14,481
Jerks! Everyone who teases me
will have nightmares tonight.

468
00:27:18,378 --> 00:27:19,462
Shit!

469
00:27:19,462 --> 00:27:20,755
I know this guy.

470
00:27:20,755 --> 00:27:22,799
What’s your name, bro?
You’re famous.

471
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,092
Can we take a picture?

472
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:25,714
I’m joining your fan club, okay?

473
00:27:25,739 --> 00:27:26,761
Stop it, Luna.

474
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:28,513
Hey, watch what you post, okay?

475
00:27:28,555 --> 00:27:29,555
Oh, come on.

476
00:27:29,723 --> 00:27:32,058
Sevi, take a picture of him while
he’s asleep with his mouth wide-open.

477
00:27:32,058 --> 00:27:34,186
- Right.
- Take a picture while he’s snoring.

478
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:35,770
- Full of drool too.
- Who are you?

479
00:27:36,104 --> 00:27:39,316
Right. We’ll make money,
let’s sell it to the fans.

480
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,818
What’s your name?
Who are you?

481
00:27:41,843 --> 00:27:42,888
Larkin Sanchez.

482
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,700
He’s so full of himself, damn.

483
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,218
Whatever!

484
00:27:50,243 --> 00:27:51,661
Take a picture of me.
Let’s take a pic together.

485
00:27:51,661 --> 00:27:53,834
Shit, why am I staring?

486
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:55,891
Good thing I’ve got my shades on.

487
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:57,250
This is fun.

488
00:27:57,834 --> 00:27:59,600
Okay, that’s cute.

489
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,671
Thirst trap.

490
00:28:01,696 --> 00:28:04,366
- Thirst trap.
- Find me a boyfriend here.

491
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:06,842
Hey!

492
00:28:07,344 --> 00:28:09,596
Aren’t you both going
to talk to each other at least?

493
00:28:11,181 --> 00:28:13,016
- No.
- Sevi’s so stubborn.

494
00:28:13,266 --> 00:28:15,285
Hey, you’ve got a
booger in your nose.

495
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:17,418
Can you take it out?
I can’t see it.

496
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:19,481
- There, I’m posting it.
- Gross. Don’t just blow your nose.

497
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:20,523
We’re posting it.

498
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:22,901
Where’s your camera, boy?

499
00:28:24,545 --> 00:28:25,570
Someone took—

500
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,906
- Where is it?
- You lost it, huh.

501
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,788
I’ll take that seat!

502
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:38,583
Ma’am, I’ll just grab
your juice, ma’am.

503
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:39,708
Okay, thank you.

504
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,091
Shit!

505
00:28:49,552 --> 00:28:51,763
It’s hot! It's really hot today!

506
00:28:51,788 --> 00:28:52,998
So hot, right? So hot.

507
00:28:53,556 --> 00:28:54,808
- It’s so hot.
- Maybe you have a fever.

508
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,268
You shouldn’t have come.

509
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,750
Wow.

510
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,498
Wow, Sevi, maybe you
should just stay quiet

511
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:03,243
since you’re not
contributing anything here.

512
00:29:03,316 --> 00:29:05,710
Wow! Did you even
contribute to the suite?

513
00:29:05,735 --> 00:29:06,704
You haven’t contributed anything.

514
00:29:06,729 --> 00:29:09,781
All you do is gossip!
Weak gossip at that.

515
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:11,866
Weak gossip, huh?

516
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:14,327
- You want to hear some gossip?
- Yeah, let’s hear it.

517
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:16,164
Well, your fifth anniversary—

518
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,889
Shit.

519
00:29:17,914 --> 00:29:19,457
My makeup.

520
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,309
Hey, don’t fight.

521
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:24,087
See? Now Via’s mad
because you two are too loud.

522
00:29:24,087 --> 00:29:25,630
These two are so annoying.

523
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,631
- You just talk too much!
- Jeez.

524
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:27,173
Luna?

525
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:28,341
- I’ll get the food.
- Damn it, Sev.

526
00:29:28,341 --> 00:29:29,616
- Don’t start with me.
- Luna—

527
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:30,641
Luna!

528
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:34,806
It smells so good!

529
00:29:35,305 --> 00:29:36,324
Sisig.

530
00:29:36,349 --> 00:29:38,189
Don’t give food to Sevi,
he doesn’t deserve it.

531
00:29:38,226 --> 00:29:39,644
But that’s actually my favorite.

532
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:40,770
Chicken and—

533
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,980
Takoyaki.

534
00:29:42,188 --> 00:29:43,188
Yes.

535
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:45,442
Ma’am, here’s your juice.

536
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:46,860
- Okay.
- Here’s the juice.

537
00:29:49,446 --> 00:29:50,446
Yes!

538
00:29:52,782 --> 00:29:54,326
Sevi, can I have
some blue lemonade?

539
00:29:54,534 --> 00:29:55,534
I’ll get it.

540
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:57,411
Put it down first.

541
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,830
Let go.

542
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:17,182
Me, too, please.

543
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,350
You can manage.

544
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,350
Thank you.

545
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,811
Give me some of that.

546
00:30:21,811 --> 00:30:22,729
Give me some.

547
00:30:22,729 --> 00:30:23,729
Whoever holds it first.

548
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:25,231
Wait!

549
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:26,232
Put it down.

550
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:27,691
I’ll get it.

551
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:30,653
I love this lunch!

552
00:30:30,653 --> 00:30:31,653
Let go.

553
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,367
This lunch is giving.

554
00:30:36,618 --> 00:30:37,618
I’ll have this.

555
00:30:38,078 --> 00:30:39,162
- Sev.
- My turn.

556
00:30:39,162 --> 00:30:40,747
You’re so stubborn, I’ll get it.

557
00:30:56,012 --> 00:30:56,805
I don’t want to go there!

558
00:30:56,805 --> 00:30:58,056
- Let’s go, bro.
- Yeah.

559
00:31:03,478 --> 00:31:04,896
Hey, you two!

560
00:31:04,921 --> 00:31:05,897
Come back here.

561
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:08,024
Are you both afraid of the sun?

562
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,858
- Let’s go.
- Hurry up!

563
00:31:11,152 --> 00:31:12,570
There they are!

564
00:31:21,663 --> 00:31:22,663
Sorry.

565
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,590
These two.

566
00:31:36,886 --> 00:31:37,886
It’s Sevi’s fault.

567
00:31:58,992 --> 00:32:00,742
- Via!
- Kino!

568
00:32:02,162 --> 00:32:03,162
Kino!

569
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:09,586
Help!

570
00:32:09,586 --> 00:32:10,586
Kino!

571
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:13,464
Kino!

572
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:21,681
It’s just seaweed.

573
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:35,886
I wonder how long
I’ll be hugged here.

574
00:32:50,081 --> 00:32:51,082
So cute!

575
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:53,693
The bikini looks nice on you, Via.

576
00:32:55,703 --> 00:32:57,079
Thanks, Sam.

577
00:32:57,228 --> 00:32:58,938
Miss you, Sam!

578
00:32:58,963 --> 00:33:01,007
Just come home already!

579
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:05,725
Arkin, you’re the only
one without a photo taken.

580
00:33:05,725 --> 00:33:06,726
Come on, I’ll take a picture of you.

581
00:33:06,726 --> 00:33:07,644
- No need.
- Yeah.

582
00:33:07,644 --> 00:33:08,644
I’ll do it.

583
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,314
They might find out I’m with you.

584
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:12,373
Huh?

585
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:15,366
None of your die-hard
fans are here anyway.

586
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,177
I just don’t want to be noticed
in the photo, you’d all look bad.

587
00:33:18,988 --> 00:33:19,739
Wow.

588
00:33:19,739 --> 00:33:20,967
- Fine!
- Then don’t!

589
00:33:21,449 --> 00:33:22,784
Come on.

590
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:24,552
Let’s see each other at the bonfire.

591
00:33:24,577 --> 00:33:26,067
- Okay?
- All right.

592
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:27,167
Let’s go.

593
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,786
Don’t tag me in that, okay.

594
00:33:29,836 --> 00:33:30,917
Why?

595
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:31,960
You’re so dramatic.

596
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,838
The fans might find out
that Via and I are together.

597
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:43,649
I just don’t want the same thing
from before to happen to Via again.

598
00:33:44,472 --> 00:33:46,516
I know she’s not okay yet,
so I’m being careful.

599
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:52,397
Oh, right.
Okay. Sure, bro.

600
00:34:01,465 --> 00:34:03,535
Sevi, can I have
some blue lemonade?

601
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,603
I’ll get it.

602
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,758
Do you regret meeting me?

603
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:23,803
Maybe it would’ve been
better if we never met.

604
00:34:24,846 --> 00:34:26,723
I guess I was wrong about us.

605
00:34:29,726 --> 00:34:31,144
I need to apologize.

606
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:44,574
What’s up, guys?

607
00:34:44,574 --> 00:34:48,161
I’m wearing the new sunglasses
sent to me by Sunset Avenue today.

608
00:34:48,494 --> 00:34:49,495
It’s so nice.

609
00:34:49,495 --> 00:34:51,122
Wait for this to
come out the market.

610
00:34:58,838 --> 00:34:59,838
Larkin.

611
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,260
Do you want me...

612
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:08,472
take a picture of you?

613
00:35:11,517 --> 00:35:12,852
It’s okay. I’m done.

614
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:15,798
I just did a product post shoot.

615
00:35:25,531 --> 00:35:26,531
Here.

616
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,998
No, it’s fine. Thanks.

617
00:35:36,084 --> 00:35:37,669
Why do you have a hair tie?

618
00:35:40,296 --> 00:35:41,296
A habit.

619
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,758
You always forget to bring one.

620
00:35:45,426 --> 00:35:46,739
Why do you have one?

621
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:49,128
I always bring one
just in case you need it.

622
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:50,973
I’ll fix your hair.

623
00:35:52,558 --> 00:35:54,310
Your hair’s a mess again.

624
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,229
Give it to me, I’ll tie it.

625
00:35:59,816 --> 00:36:00,817
I’ll go ahead.

626
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:07,882
Can we talk?

627
00:36:14,565 --> 00:36:15,594
Sure.

628
00:36:18,418 --> 00:36:19,544
Let’s go somewhere.

629
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,047
Let’s go.

630
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,730
Um...

631
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:43,776
I’m sorry.

632
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:48,108
I didn't mean what
I said the other day

633
00:36:48,392 --> 00:36:50,352
that maybe I shouldn’t have met you.

634
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,331
I just got carried
away by my emotions.

635
00:37:00,668 --> 00:37:01,836
It’s okay, Via.

636
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,921
I understand.

637
00:37:04,046 --> 00:37:05,047
Still—

638
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:07,884
I’m sorry.

639
00:37:10,845 --> 00:37:13,347
And if it’s okay…

640
00:37:15,224 --> 00:37:16,476
What?

641
00:37:19,145 --> 00:37:20,730
Can we just...

642
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:24,609
act normal in front of our friends?

643
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,529
I feel like they’re uncomfortable.

644
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:31,125
With how we act
towards each other.

645
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,535
Okay, sure.

646
00:37:35,036 --> 00:37:38,456
Also, I don’t know but—

647
00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:41,209
are you mad at me?

648
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,305
I’m not mad.

649
00:37:59,352 --> 00:38:00,478
You’re so cute.

650
00:38:21,415 --> 00:38:22,415
Thanks.

651
00:38:51,817 --> 00:38:52,777
Let’s go.

652
00:38:52,802 --> 00:38:54,208
They might be looking for us.

653
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,740
Let’s go.

654
00:39:16,512 --> 00:39:18,389
- Cheers!
- Cheers, guys.

655
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,224
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

656
00:39:25,813 --> 00:39:27,106
Are you okay?

657
00:39:27,106 --> 00:39:28,941
I mean, I saw you guys talking.

658
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,072
Yes. We’re okay now.

659
00:39:35,948 --> 00:39:37,074
That’s good.

660
00:39:39,702 --> 00:39:42,330
Bro, sing for us.

661
00:39:43,205 --> 00:39:45,499
Sing that song,
the “Golden Scenery”.

662
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:47,552
That one’s nice.

663
00:39:48,961 --> 00:39:50,922
Come on, I haven’t
heard it live in a long time,

664
00:39:50,947 --> 00:39:52,365
and it’s my favorite.

665
00:39:54,115 --> 00:39:57,743
All right, since it’s
your favorite, I’ll sing it for you.

666
00:39:58,092 --> 00:39:59,260
Really? For me?

667
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:01,036
I’ll sing it, but—

668
00:40:02,155 --> 00:40:04,237
It will be a different
version of the song.

669
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:07,302
Shit. You might start
charging us later.

670
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,585
Of course, it will be
free for you guys.

671
00:40:11,695 --> 00:40:14,239
You’re some of the first
people who listened to my music.

672
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,325
Go, Arkin! Let’s go!

673
00:40:35,653 --> 00:40:40,824
Left thinking in the
midst of the chaos,

674
00:40:41,615 --> 00:40:47,270
utterly bewildered by
the world I’m living in.

675
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:52,942
I can't tell if this is a dream,

676
00:40:53,526 --> 00:40:59,156
as if my heart
was searching for its home.

677
00:41:00,408 --> 00:41:06,163
In the daylight, I stand dazed.

678
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:12,491
Just staring at the
line where we once met.

679
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:19,093
I don't know anymore,

680
00:41:19,093 --> 00:41:23,970
I get confused whenever
I look for you in…

681
00:41:25,057 --> 00:41:33,190
A golden scenery
beneath the sky,

682
00:41:33,215 --> 00:41:38,304
wishing you were with me.

683
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:50,374
As the wind blows,
along with the song, I long for you.

684
00:41:50,583 --> 00:42:02,636
May my prayer be heard,
that you answer my plea.

685
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:15,441
With the orange sky above,
I won’t impose myself on you.

686
00:42:19,945 --> 00:42:20,988
Wow.

687
00:42:21,447 --> 00:42:23,157
- So beautiful.
- You’re really good.

688
00:42:24,467 --> 00:42:26,719
- My best friend really is the best.
- Amazing. I got goosebumps.

689
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,162
- Your voice is really beautiful!
- Next level talent!

690
00:42:28,162 --> 00:42:29,580
You really could be
an actor and a singer.

691
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,748
- Five stars from me.
- Wow.

692
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:31,874
Definitely, five stars.

693
00:42:31,874 --> 00:42:33,375
And because of that, Via…

694
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,436
Please do the honors.

695
00:42:35,461 --> 00:42:36,754
Yeah, Via.

696
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,297
What? I don’t even sing anymore.

697
00:42:38,297 --> 00:42:39,006
I don’t want to.

698
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,099
Come on, Via!
Just this once.

699
00:42:41,124 --> 00:42:42,834
We’re not strangers, you know.

700
00:42:42,968 --> 00:42:44,261
Come on, Via.

701
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,489
- You can do it.
- Come on.

702
00:42:46,514 --> 00:42:47,514
Please?

703
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,309
Pretty please?

704
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,479
- Take it already.
- Do I have a choice?

705
00:42:53,687 --> 00:42:54,939
Yes!

706
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:56,938
- Is there a capo?
- Yeah.

707
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:01,861
Same spot?

708
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:03,029
Here.

709
00:43:13,432 --> 00:43:19,963
I find myself smiling,

710
00:43:20,051 --> 00:43:27,113
and you’re the reason why.

711
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:32,865
The colors of our world return anew.

712
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:39,692
I find myself smiling again.

713
00:43:46,906 --> 00:43:48,032
Wow!

714
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:49,785
Your voice is so smooth.

715
00:44:56,018 --> 00:44:57,018
Thank you.

716
00:44:57,228 --> 00:44:58,687
Did they hear me?

717
00:44:59,855 --> 00:45:00,981
We greeted them, too.

718
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,442
Hey, come with us
on the beach trip.

719
00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:05,444
You know, it’s been so long
since you’ve hung out with us.

720
00:45:05,444 --> 00:45:06,528
I was even thinking,

721
00:45:06,528 --> 00:45:09,907
he doesn’t want to be
friends with us anymore.

722
00:45:10,065 --> 00:45:11,075
Right.

723
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,431
- So dramatic.
- Right?

724
00:45:12,456 --> 00:45:13,583
You guys are so dramatic.

725
00:45:13,661 --> 00:45:15,162
You know I’m busy.

726
00:45:15,537 --> 00:45:16,580
Busy?

727
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,040
Then why are you such a killjoy?

728
00:45:18,065 --> 00:45:19,650
Is your name Kalix or something?

729
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:20,833
Huh?

730
00:45:20,876 --> 00:45:24,546
Wow! Sevi, you’ve been
saying that for years

731
00:45:24,546 --> 00:45:27,132
and you’re still not
done with that joke.

732
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:28,425
Move on already.

733
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:30,344
I am moving on.

734
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,377
Maybe next time, bro.

735
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,891
Via might feel awkward.
You know we’re not okay.

736
00:45:37,896 --> 00:45:41,272
Uh... Via’s not coming, right?

737
00:45:45,567 --> 00:45:50,072
Yeah, Via’s not coming because
I know she has somewhere to go.

738
00:45:50,072 --> 00:45:52,157
- To the site in Bulacan.
- Yeah, in Bulacan she has—

739
00:45:52,157 --> 00:45:54,159
- She has something to do.
- Yeah, she has—

740
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:55,159
something to do.

741
00:45:55,196 --> 00:45:55,995
Yeah.

742
00:45:55,995 --> 00:45:57,621
- So, come with us, bro.
- Come on.

743
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:59,581
- We miss you.
- Yeah.

744
00:45:59,915 --> 00:46:01,250
Via’s not coming.

745
00:46:02,001 --> 00:46:04,003
If Via’s not there, then okay.

746
00:46:04,169 --> 00:46:05,212
- Right?
- Great!

747
00:46:05,212 --> 00:46:06,212
Right?

748
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,270
Yay!

749
00:46:12,177 --> 00:46:13,177
Ouch!

750
00:46:26,067 --> 00:46:28,836
- Come on, let's go!
- Let's go!

751
00:46:28,861 --> 00:46:30,093
- Let’s go.
- Come on.

752
00:46:31,044 --> 00:46:34,004
- Hurry up!
- Come on, let's go!

753
00:46:35,117 --> 00:46:36,117
I’m coming!

754
00:46:47,883 --> 00:46:49,183
Ma'am, here's your juice.

755
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:50,208
Oh, yes.

756
00:46:57,734 --> 00:46:59,101
It’s Via’s favorite.

757
00:47:01,016 --> 00:47:02,244
Sevi, can I have
some blue lemonade?

758
00:47:02,269 --> 00:47:03,269
I’ll get it.

759
00:47:04,063 --> 00:47:05,063
Put it down first.

760
00:47:05,481 --> 00:47:06,481
Let go.

761
00:47:21,995 --> 00:47:23,747
Show your eyes a bit.

762
00:47:24,454 --> 00:47:25,601
Perfect!

763
00:47:25,626 --> 00:47:27,044
Don’t smile.

764
00:47:27,069 --> 00:47:28,737
I can’t help it.

765
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:32,873
Don’t, this is supposed
to be a thirst trap photo.

766
00:47:35,304 --> 00:47:36,387
There you go.

767
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:37,679
- Wow, bro.
- Ready?

768
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:39,014
It’s been so long
since I’ve been to the gym.

769
00:47:39,014 --> 00:47:41,201
- What am I going to do with this?
- Don’t put your hand on your waist.

770
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:42,476
That’s it!

771
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:45,646
I think it’s time to get ripped.

772
00:47:45,979 --> 00:47:47,648
You’re way more
ripped than me now.

773
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:49,441
Are you still working out there?

774
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,073
So cute.

775
00:47:58,617 --> 00:48:01,787
Bro, I know I’m cute.

776
00:48:02,262 --> 00:48:03,472
Moron. I’m not referring to you.

777
00:48:03,497 --> 00:48:04,497
Huh?

778
00:48:06,186 --> 00:48:07,209
Who’s cute then?

779
00:48:07,234 --> 00:48:09,695
- I’m shy.
- My turn!

780
00:48:09,837 --> 00:48:12,196
Just do it like
that and add this.

781
00:48:12,548 --> 00:48:14,675
All right, it’s you.
Whatever makes you happy.

782
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,077
You’re so cute!
I just want to pinch you.

783
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,270
Thank you.

784
00:48:18,685 --> 00:48:19,881
So cute!

785
00:48:21,849 --> 00:48:23,629
Move over. One more.

786
00:48:23,684 --> 00:48:25,853
- I’m shy. I feel embarrassed.
- One, two, three—

787
00:48:26,854 --> 00:48:28,105
There, just a candid shot.

788
00:48:28,657 --> 00:48:30,092
You should add
a little something—

789
00:48:34,172 --> 00:48:36,299
Bro, the sand here is so nice.

790
00:48:45,414 --> 00:48:47,541
Ah, bro, yeah.
Totally. It’s nice.

791
00:48:52,983 --> 00:48:55,174
Hey, you two!
Come back here.

792
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:57,393
Are you both afraid of the sun?

793
00:48:57,499 --> 00:48:59,795
- Let’s go!
- Come on!

794
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,310
How’s the movie?

795
00:49:06,335 --> 00:49:08,921
That movie was so good.
You and Clea were so cute together.

796
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,024
You really like her, huh?

797
00:49:14,943 --> 00:49:17,905
Take this before lunch, don’t skip meals!
- Kino

798
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:24,328
Via, Arkin brought so much food.

799
00:49:24,353 --> 00:49:25,829
I’ll get your food ready.

800
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:31,752
Take this.

801
00:49:38,717 --> 00:49:40,677
Drink water all the time
so you don’t get dehydrated,

802
00:49:40,702 --> 00:49:44,540
and bring an umbrella so
you won’t get wet if it rains.

803
00:49:45,557 --> 00:49:47,476
Eat already, you’re so stubborn.

804
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,839
You’re the one being stubborn.

805
00:49:51,004 --> 00:49:53,190
I’m so tired from work,
and you’re still bothering me.

806
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,399
You’re so relentless.

807
00:50:00,979 --> 00:50:02,036
Here, take this.
