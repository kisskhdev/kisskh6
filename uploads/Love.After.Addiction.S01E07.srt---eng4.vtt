00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.500
"Love After Addiction"

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600
(Episode 7)

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.519
That's him!

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:29.239
So it's him!

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:30.719
It's him, it's him!

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.560
Yes, yes. Exactly.

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:32.239
So it's him.

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:33.359
That's him!

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.000
This matter is hard to talk about.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.239
It's so shameful.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.359
It's indecent! Corrupting morals!

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:47.679
For something like this to happen,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.720
I've never even seen anything like it!

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.359
What do we do?

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.880
He's still in the group chat!

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.560
That's the one!

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.736
Hooking up with that male celebrity

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.400
in the village.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.560
How disgusting.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.359
If I ever had a son like that,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.760
I'd beat him to death.

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:06.679
The ancestors must have done something awful.

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:18.936
What's going on with little Meng lately?

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.680
He's not in a good state.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.120
Exactly.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.280
His face is pale.

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.639
What's wrong?

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:25.079
You want to quit the show?

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.680
Yes.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.759
Your village chief and I

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:27.840
signed a contract.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
You'd be breaching it.

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.599
Should I

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:33.400
give your village chief

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:34.919
a call?

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.600
Why is everyone looking at me?

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:20.360
Eat up.

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:21.895
Today's a rare treat with extra dishes.

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:23.639
Don't waste it. Get some nutrition.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.000
Brother Yoki, you're hurt!

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.240
It's nothing.

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.319
Ran into a lamppost.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.560
Then eat more to recover.

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.800
Your face...

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.120
It's fine.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.319
Just...

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.960
Fell during training.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.120
Have some fish.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.520
Thanks.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.599
Got bumped during training.

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.520
But...

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.040
You don't look too good either.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.440
Haven't been resting well?

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:58.639
A bit.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.960
I have a bottle of

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.960
sleep-aid essential oil.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.520
If you want it,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.640
I can bring it over tonight.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
No need.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.800
Actually I do.

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:16.759
Tonight,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.240
I'll come to you.

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:23.479
Do you know how to give a massage?

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:25.759
A little bit.

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:27.519
Nine o'clock tonight.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.800
I'll come to your room.

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.199
Deal?

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.800
Deal.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.880
Brother Yang, the last shrimp is for you.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.120
He should eat less.

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:49.040
If he eats too much,

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:50.439
he gets in a bad mood.

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.199
Don't you only like the heads?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.800
Aren't those all gone?

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:58.199
Do you like it?

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.719
I'll order twenty more plates for you.

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:00.879
Twenty plates?

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:01.639
Are you serious?

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:02.959
Dead serious.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.560
All you can eat.

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.600
You think I don't dare to eat it?

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.040
You think I don't dare to eat it?

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.480
Let me tell you,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.240
you serve twenty, I'll eat twenty.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.279
However many you serve, I'll eat.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.120
And if I can't finish...

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.920
I'll take it to go.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.199
What's going on?

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.519
Isn't this a good thing?

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:32.519
Why is it that...?

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.079
Or maybe...

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.319
Later, I should

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.800
have a clear talk with Brother Yoki.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.800
What am I even doing?

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.279
Brother Yoki...

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.560
Actually, I...

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:51.639
Actually what?

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.480
Why is it you?

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.480
What?

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.639
Are you disappointed to see me?

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.279
Are you someone who

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:18.800
can't live without a man?

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:26.999
What are you trying to do?

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.480
I'll teach you a lesson today.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.160
On what being devoted means.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.920
What are you doing?

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:53.479
Weren't you going for a massage?

00:06:55.952 --> 00:06:56.952
You're kicking me out?

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.120
Yes.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.240
I saw everything.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.240
Yes.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.120
I've always been your fan.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.040
Ever since your debut.

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:18.959
What of it?

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:20.639
That's what a brother should do.

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:22.519
And that's what an old classmate should do too.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.279
Then why are you hiding?

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:31.079
You feel guilty.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.560
I don't!

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.480
Look at me.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.200
You clearly have feelings for me too.

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:53.519
What are you afraid of?

00:07:57.913 --> 00:07:59.313
I'm afraid of disappointing my dad.

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:02.279
I'm afraid of being

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:04.079
pointed at and whispered about on the street.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.160
I'm afraid of being called a pervert.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.120
Just like today.

00:08:25.673 --> 00:08:26.952
Did I push too hard?

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.920
And scared him away?

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:40.879
I can't be so selfish.

00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:42.759
I can't.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.080
Yoki, sweetie.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.519
How have you been these days?

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.240
Not great.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
What happened?

00:08:57.113 --> 00:08:59.153
Did the production team give you a hard time again?

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:00.919
No.

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:04.279
It's just...

00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:06.919
I might really end up

00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:07.919
homeless.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.600
Nonsense!

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.960
Don't you have a

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:11.600
three-story villa

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.360
downtown?

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:15.479
I'm not talking about that.

00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:20.039
Forget it.

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:21.279
What's up?

00:09:22.159 --> 00:09:23.240
Cheer up!

00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:24.320
I've prepared

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.759
a big surprise for you.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.120
What kind of surprise?

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:28.960
Just wait.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.039
Guaranteed to blow you away.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.360
Grandma.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.519
I noticed you often

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:52.879
just stare at this photo.

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:54.679
You and this person...

00:09:56.639 --> 00:09:58.840
are just like you two.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.720
Grandma?

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.600
Let me trim your other hand's nails.

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:31.159
Here.

00:10:44.898 --> 00:10:45.898
It's for you to press on your face.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.120
Your face is swollen and you're still eating?

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.240
What are you doing sitting here?

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:09.439
I wanted to say goodbye to you in person.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.759
Since I've seen you now,

00:11:14.759 --> 00:11:15.759
I'll be on my way.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.120
There are no cars out at this hour.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.960
It's okay.

00:11:25.039 --> 00:11:26.479
I don't want to trouble you anymore.

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:28.679
During this time,

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:30.799
thank you for taking care of me.

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:45.799
This is too rushed.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.440
I forgot to pack my clothes.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.960
Never mind.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.240
I don't need the clothes.

00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:51.559
You keep them.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.960
You...

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:00.959
you're not kicking me out?

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:03.720
I just didn't want

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.760
to put the production team in a difficult position.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.200
But we have a deal.

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:08.999
We must sleep in separate beds.

00:12:09.759 --> 00:12:11.759
And to keep a two-meter
distance from me from now on.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:19.279
Okay.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.120
I promise.

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:33.440
One point nine meters.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.559
This isn't even two meters.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.000
Am I supposed to sleep in the living room?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.240
Should I be braver?

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.919
Did I push him too hard?

00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:25.279
Will they make up?

00:13:37.759 --> 00:13:38.759
Beautiful.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.080
So beautiful.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.559
Like love itself.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.840
Refreshing and delightful.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.000
Next up, we're starting the

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.040
"Treasure Hunt for Love" timed competition!

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.440
All throughout the mountain,

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.120
we have set up

00:13:56.759 --> 00:13:57.919
fifteen treasure spots.

00:13:58.759 --> 00:13:59.759
At each treasure spot,

00:14:00.559 --> 00:14:02.239
there's a marker from our production team.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.120
Find this golden treasure

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.559
and take out this gold coin,

00:14:10.519 --> 00:14:11.639
then you can exchange it for

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.279
five hundred "Love Bucks."

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.880
The person who finds the most

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.360
can earn an additional

00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:17.759
ten thousand "Love Bucks."

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:18.519
Of course,

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.759
this money isn't for you.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.159
It's for us

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.399
to build a "Love Book Corner"

00:14:23.759 --> 00:14:25.879
for the children of Lanwan Village.

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:27.639
Director.

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:28.679
How are we forming teams?

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.039
Yeah, how do we split up?

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.360
You guys are so eager,

00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:32.599
do you even need to ask me?

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.440
Then free grouping it is.

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:35.639
Saves time.

00:14:35.799 --> 00:14:36.720
Since Teacher Yoki

00:14:36.759 --> 00:14:37.759
has said so,

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.120
then no problem.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.840
Let's save time.

00:14:41.399 --> 00:14:42.399
The competition

00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:43.639
starts now!

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:53.679
Qiang, come with me.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.960
I'm a safety officer.

00:14:55.559 --> 00:14:56.559
Right.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.080
I know you're a safety officer.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.615
A safety officer protects my safety.

00:14:59.639 --> 00:15:00.639
That's only right.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.840
Let's go.

00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:13.714
"Love Hunt Timed Competition"

00:15:14.919 --> 00:15:16.840
This Qiang is really something else.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.879
He just abandoned me and ran off.

00:15:20.919 --> 00:15:21.360
Whatever...

00:15:21.679 --> 00:15:22.759
I have to rely on myself.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.879
I can win on my own too.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.799
Yoki is the best!

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:40.239
Could you guys make it a little more challenging?

00:15:40.519 --> 00:15:42.120
You placed them so obviously.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.519
You think people are idiots?

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.639
But I'm not an idiot.

00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:48.559
Whoever wants it can take it.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.480
I'm giving it to you.

00:16:30.799 --> 00:16:31.799
Is it really this easy?

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.987
[Everyone has one point]

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.319
Those jerks.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.080
Who put this on a grave mound?

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.160
Where's the treasure box?

00:17:39.119 --> 00:17:40.119
Alright.

00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:41.919
Now this one is well-hidden.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.720
One thousand.

00:18:18.279 --> 00:18:19.279
Two thousand.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.200
Three thousand.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.200
What time is it?

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.960
- Four thousand.
- It's almost nine.

00:18:24.079 --> 00:18:25.079
Five thousand.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.720
Director!

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.880
Yoki isn't back yet.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.400
Director, Yoki still hasn't returned!

00:18:44.319 --> 00:18:46.279
Teacher Yoki, way to go!

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.640
Teacher Yoki

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.440
is sure to win!

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:55.759
Yoki!

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.880
Yoki! Can you hear me? Yoki!

00:18:58.519 --> 00:18:59.519
Yoki! Respond!

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.240
Yoki, respond if you can hear me!

00:19:01.519 --> 00:19:02.680
Yoki! Can you hear me? Yoki!
