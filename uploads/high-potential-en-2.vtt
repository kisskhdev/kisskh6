The Pillsbury variation.

In chess, it's a variation
of the Queen's Gambit Declined.

-Anyone see who left the bag?
-No.

-Where's the bomb?

That means even after we find Derek,

because if it was after Matthew walked
into our precinct,

So far all we've learned
about Matthew Clark

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:38.252
is he volunteers at the local hospital.

-He said he was reading last night, right?
-Yeah, not the best alibi.

If Petrov had reported the alert,
it would have started that nuclear war.

Okay, I get it. He's sending us a message,

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:31.514

to improperly shelve your books.

in one of your cars, Lieutenant.

00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:26.939
And until we know more,
you're still safer with us. Believe me.

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:31.319
How are you going to protect me?
You can't even protect yourselves.

00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:34.572
[scoffs] Let's go.

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:37.283
Where the hell's he going?

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:39.952
Jason Howard just hired
his own private security.

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:42.496
Look, I don't blame him.
We're lucky no one was inside that car.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.248
Yeah, we're lucky.
I'm feeling super lucky.

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:45.916
Morgan, do you need more time?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.169
I don't need time.
I need us to get this guy.

00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:50.755
[grunts] How the hell did this happen?

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.759
Well, apparently, he put a bomb
on Karadec's car the day of the party.

00:18:54.842 --> 00:18:57.386
But why come after us?
He's never targeted the police before.

00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:04.060
The message wasn't for us.
The message was for Jason.

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:06.687
Matthew Clark needed my car
to blow up outside Jason's house

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:08.272
so he'd stop letting us protect him.

00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:11.400
And we still have no idea where Derek is.

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:13.694
[sighs] Yeah, or how to find Maya.

00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:18.240
Adam, contact Jason's lawyer, see if
she'll listen to reason, even if he won't.

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:19.659
I'll get an update on Derek.

00:19:19.742 --> 00:19:21.410
And, Morgan, I want you to go home.

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:23.871
-Check on your family now while you can.
-Lieutenant--

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:25.790
We have no witnesses,
no evidence, no leads.

00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:28.793
The minute we do, you'll hear from me.
Go home, get some rest.

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:31.045
Looks like it's gonna
be a long night anyway.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.632
Go, go, go.

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:56.278
Hey, sorry about before.

00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:58.114
Why don't you let us give you a ride
back to LA, huh?

00:19:58.197 --> 00:20:00.199
I never told you where I was going.

00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:02.243
-Your jacket did.
-Yeah, I like blue.

00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:04.161
Look, we know you're not Roman Sinquerra,

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.455
so why don't you tell us
why you're using his name?

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:07.581
Well, that depends.

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:10.668
Did they start letting LAPD make arrests
out of state?

00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:13.129
-We just want to talk. That's it.
-Right.

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:15.297
Have a nice drive home, Detectives.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.593
Morgan Gillory sent us.

00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:26.350
Sorry. Never heard of him.

00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:32.523
What happened to the chips?

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:34.066
Oh. What a beautiful greeting.

00:20:34.608 --> 00:20:36.819
-Where's Ludo?
-Elliot's room. [sighs]

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:38.654
They still practicing
for the talent show?

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:41.699
Mm-hmm. I tried to talk some sense
into both of them, but…

00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:45.327
-Do you know what he's doing?
-No, uh-uh.

00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:47.037
Did you try listening at the door?

00:20:47.121 --> 00:20:50.666
Yeah, but all I heard was Elliot
pushing back on creative differences.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:54.295
Okay. All right, well,
I guess we'll see tomorrow.

00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:56.338
-Mm-mmm. No, I'm not going.
-Yeah, you're going.

00:20:56.422 --> 00:20:58.090
-No, no, no. Not going.
-Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:00.134
You're gonna be there,
you're gonna support your brother,

00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:01.469
and you're gonna support your mom.

00:21:01.552 --> 00:21:03.220
This is gonna be quite a challenge for me.

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:04.472
Yeah, no kidding.

00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:07.933
Might be the greatest social train wreck
in school history.

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:09.935
Oh, boy.

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:11.020
[knocks on door]

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:12.605
[laptop beeping, chiming]

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:16.442
-Hey, Mom.
-Perfect timing.

00:21:16.525 --> 00:21:18.068
El and I were just about to take five.

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:21.363
-Mind if I jump in?
-He's all yours.

00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:26.702
Wow. You guys rehearsing
some sort of a Tasmanian Devil routine?

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:29.997
Tasmanian devils are often depicted
as hyperactive and aggressive,

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.625
but they're actually pretty shy
and solitary animals,

00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:34.210
except when feeding or mating.

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:35.503
Yeah, I know.

00:21:35.586 --> 00:21:37.213
I was just doing
a little Looney Tunes thing.

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:39.882
-So, you all ready for tomorrow?
-I will be. [sighs]

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:40.966
Okay.

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.302
Well, I can't wait to see it,
whatever it is.

00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:47.181
You're worried I'm gonna do something
super nerdy and get my butt kicked.

00:21:47.264 --> 00:21:50.684
Me? No. No, I don't… I don't.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.979
It's okay. I'm worried too.

00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:57.525
Are you? Oh, buddy.

00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:00.861
I was maybe feeling a little bit nervous.

00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:05.157
You and I are not like other people,
and honestly, I think that's cool,

00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:08.285
but sometimes it can make us
a little bit of a target, right?

00:22:09.912 --> 00:22:13.791
You know what? I'm actually dealing
with a bully at my work right now.

00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:16.168
I think that might be why
I'm feeling a little overprotective,

00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:17.586
but I don't want you to be scared.

00:22:18.254 --> 00:22:20.297
I want you to work really hard
on whatever this is

00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:23.676
and go out there tomorrow,
and have fun and be proud of yourself,

00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:25.177
no matter what the reaction is.

00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:26.428
I will.

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:28.389
And they might make fun of me,

00:22:28.472 --> 00:22:30.808
but sometimes you have
to lose the battle to win the war.

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:35.688
Right. Right.

00:22:37.398 --> 00:22:38.899
Maybe I'm not supposed to win.

00:22:40.109 --> 00:22:41.110
What do you mean?

00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:43.821
The guy at work, he was reading
a book about Stanislav Petrov.

00:22:43.904 --> 00:22:45.281
The man who saved the world.

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:48.409
I think he's telling me
to be more like Petrov.

00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:53.289
I think the only way I can beat this guy…

00:22:54.456 --> 00:22:56.375
is if I'm willing to lose.

00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:01.589
Dad, break's over,
it's getting weird in here!

00:23:01.672 --> 00:23:03.007
I think screaming should be your talent.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.425
-What happened?
-[Morgan] I gotta go.

00:23:04.508 --> 00:23:07.136
-Where?
-Play a game of chicken.

00:23:08.596 --> 00:23:09.638
What did you say to her?

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:12.099
[knocks on door]

00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:17.813
We need to talk.

00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:20.900
Come on in.

00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:32.036
-This is quite a surprise.
-I doubt that.

00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:33.621
Did you find your missing woman?

00:23:33.704 --> 00:23:35.372
No, not yet.

00:23:35.456 --> 00:23:40.628
Your friends at the LAPD,
do they know you're here, Morgan Gillory?

00:23:44.298 --> 00:23:45.299
No.

00:23:45.925 --> 00:23:48.260
Pool closes at 10:00,
restaurants at 11:00.

00:23:48.344 --> 00:23:49.470
Thank you.

00:23:57.811 --> 00:23:59.313
[Matthew] If you really think…

00:24:00.064 --> 00:24:01.065
I did…

00:24:02.066 --> 00:24:05.319
all of those horrible things,

00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:08.906
why would you come here alone?

00:24:09.823 --> 00:24:11.951
Because if you wanted me dead,
I already would be.

00:24:12.868 --> 00:24:14.828
I think you like this game
as much as I do.

00:24:14.912 --> 00:24:17.414
-I think that's why you're here.
-You're wrong.

00:24:17.498 --> 00:24:18.540
[chuckles]

00:24:19.249 --> 00:24:21.794
I don't like it. I'm here to quit.

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.133
It's a game of chicken, right?

00:24:28.217 --> 00:24:30.552
You knew I was standing
on the other side of that glass.

00:24:30.636 --> 00:24:31.720
You wanted me to know that you loved

00:24:31.804 --> 00:24:33.389
playing this game
when you were a little kid.

00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:37.935
Two sides racing toward each other,
if no one swerves, total annihilation.

00:24:44.358 --> 00:24:45.401
I swerve.

00:24:56.412 --> 00:24:57.705
I don't believe you.

00:24:57.788 --> 00:25:00.165
You don't have to believe me.
I'm just done.

00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:04.461
You know where I live.
You know where I buy groceries.

00:25:04.545 --> 00:25:07.840
You've proven that you can get to me
and my children.

00:25:08.465 --> 00:25:10.342
And I will protect them.

00:25:11.677 --> 00:25:13.804
So I have to protect myself
for their sake.

00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:19.727
Can you imagine being a little kid
and losing your mom?

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.066
I'm not gonna do that to them.

00:25:26.984 --> 00:25:28.485
This is my fault. I put us in danger.

00:25:28.569 --> 00:25:30.112
I was trying to prove
that I could do this,

00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:33.532
but I can't because you are smarter
than me, so you win.

00:25:35.492 --> 00:25:37.119
That's it, it's done.

00:25:38.954 --> 00:25:40.414
Just tell me where Maya is.

00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:41.999
[phone buzzes]

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:46.503
Your partner's probably worried about you.

00:25:48.172 --> 00:25:50.966
Adam, we just got a hit
on Derek's credit card,

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:52.176
a location on the east side.

00:25:52.259 --> 00:25:53.927
-Morgan's not answering.
-We'll keep trying her.

00:25:54.011 --> 00:25:56.930
Right now, I need you to make sure
we get to Jason before Derek does.

00:25:57.014 --> 00:25:58.307
Send me the address.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.144
I wish I could help you, Morgan,
but like I said,

00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:04.104
I don't know anything
about this missing woman.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:05.731
What?

00:26:06.607 --> 00:26:08.692
That's it? Nothing?

00:26:10.652 --> 00:26:13.197
No, no, come on, no, I…
I gave you what you wanted.

00:26:13.906 --> 00:26:15.574
I quit, you won.

00:26:15.657 --> 00:26:17.076
The game is over.

00:26:17.159 --> 00:26:18.911
I really do hope you find her.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:21.580
[gasps]

00:26:27.878 --> 00:26:28.921
Hey, Morgan.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:32.091
It's an old building.

00:26:32.174 --> 00:26:34.593
The elevator's been acting up.
You should probably play it safe.

00:26:36.512 --> 00:26:37.638
Take the stairs.

00:26:43.227 --> 00:26:45.270
[Jason] I don't belong in this situation.

00:26:45.354 --> 00:26:49.441
You guys are gonna eat with me, right?
I feel like I'm in a cage.

00:26:49.525 --> 00:26:52.194
-[security] Stay in the room, sir.
-I need some air.

00:26:52.986 --> 00:26:54.613
[Jason] I'll be right there.

00:26:57.157 --> 00:26:58.450
Morgan, where are you?

00:26:58.534 --> 00:26:59.993
Just checking something out. You?

00:27:00.077 --> 00:27:02.037
Derek just checked into a hotel
on the east side.

00:27:02.121 --> 00:27:03.872
We think Jason did too,
but he's not picking up,

00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:06.041
so I'm headed over there to try
to find him before Derek does.

00:27:06.125 --> 00:27:08.252
-Do you hear that?
-[song playing in distance]

00:27:08.335 --> 00:27:10.754
-"Bizarre Love Triangle."
-Where are you?

00:27:10.838 --> 00:27:12.798
I'm at Matthew's apartment building,
third floor.

00:27:12.881 --> 00:27:15.050
-Maya. [panting]
-What the hell are you doing over there?

00:27:15.134 --> 00:27:16.885
-Maya!
-Morgan, I'm sending backup.

00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:18.512
No, I'm fine. Go get Jason. Maya!

00:27:18.595 --> 00:27:20.514
-Morgan. Morgan, hello?
-Maya!

00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:24.810
LAPD.

00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:29.106
Hey, Jason and Derek both checked in
a half hour ago.

00:27:29.857 --> 00:27:32.317
Morgan? Morgan, talk to me.

00:27:33.402 --> 00:27:35.279
Oh, God. That sucks.

00:27:35.779 --> 00:27:37.823
[grunting]

Okay, Maya, I work with the police,

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.184

who he thinks killed you,

00:28:47.267 --> 00:28:48.852

that you're alive. Okay?

-[Maya] Derek, Derek, I'm okay.

00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:56.318
I'll never see her again and I'll never
be able to make it up to her. [cries]

00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:58.946

personal details, whatever it takes.

00:28:59.029 --> 00:29:00.280
Make him believe it.

00:29:01.114 --> 00:29:04.451
[stammering] Derek, we were…
We were married in Santa Barbara and…

00:29:04.534 --> 00:29:07.496
and we always… We never took a honeymoon,
but we always said we were going to.

00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:09.331

[mouthing words] Thank you.

00:30:06.388 --> 00:30:08.473
DA still doesn't think
there's enough evidence

00:30:08.557 --> 00:30:10.225
to arrest Matthew for Maya's abduction.

00:30:10.308 --> 00:30:12.644
What are you talking about?
We found her in his apartment building.

00:30:12.728 --> 00:30:15.313
Yeah, well, the landlord says
the apartment's been vacant for weeks

00:30:15.397 --> 00:30:16.982
and CSU still hasn't found anything yet.

00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:19.484
And since Maya didn't see
the man who abducted her…

00:30:19.568 --> 00:30:21.153
Then we are right back where we started.

00:30:22.154 --> 00:30:24.865
Hey, don't worry, he'll see
the inside of a prison cell soon.

00:30:26.074 --> 00:30:27.325
I don't think so.

00:30:29.036 --> 00:30:30.120
[sighs]

00:30:30.203 --> 00:30:33.040
Do you remember the photograph
of the monkey we found in his apartment?

00:30:33.749 --> 00:30:35.125
It's a tarsier monkey.

00:30:35.208 --> 00:30:37.127
I think he hung it up on the wall
as a reminder.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:38.211
A reminder of what?

00:30:38.295 --> 00:30:41.048
Tarsier monkeys refuse
to be taken into captivity.

00:30:41.131 --> 00:30:42.674
The second they get inside of a cage,

00:30:42.758 --> 00:30:45.677
they get so stressed out
that they start to self-mutilate

00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:48.597
and try and kill themselves.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.515
You're saying he won't be taken alive.

00:30:51.475 --> 00:30:53.226
Hey, look who's back.

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:55.395
Sorry, we didn't bring you a souvenir
from Vegas.

00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:58.148
I'm sorry we didn't catch the guy.

00:30:58.231 --> 00:31:01.485
It's all right. [sighs] Secretly hoping
to put the cuffs on him myself.

00:31:01.568 --> 00:31:03.987
Hey, guys, take a look at this.
Maya's medical records just came in.

00:31:04.071 --> 00:31:07.532
No broken bones, no bruises,
no drugs in her system.

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:10.702
How do you abduct someone
without leaving a scratch?

00:31:12.746 --> 00:31:15.874
The blood in the trunk matched Maya's,
and she didn't have any cuts.

00:31:17.334 --> 00:31:19.294
How's it possible?

00:31:23.048 --> 00:31:28.136
Because the blood didn't leave
Maya's body within the last 48 hours.

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:33.975
What are you thinking?

00:31:39.064 --> 00:31:40.065
[knocks on door]

00:31:46.613 --> 00:31:48.198

00:31:57.499 --> 00:32:00.377
To what do I owe this pleasure?

00:32:00.877 --> 00:32:04.172
Oh, you know, I just…
I was reading about your mom.

00:32:05.215 --> 00:32:06.424
Oh.

00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:10.846
Yeah, she worked at a hotel in Bel Air,
is that right?

00:32:10.929 --> 00:32:13.849
Up until the point where she was accused
of stealing by a guest.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.977
-My mom never stole anything.
-Oh.

00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:20.272
But in her file,
it's pretty clear she confessed.

00:32:20.355 --> 00:32:22.107
It was a forced confession.

00:32:22.649 --> 00:32:23.984
But she still died in jail, right?

00:32:24.067 --> 00:32:27.195
Left you bouncing around
from family member to family member,

00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:29.573

with nobody to play with.

[chuckles]

00:32:31.908 --> 00:32:35.412
See, I don't think you ever meant
to hurt Maya at all.

00:32:35.495 --> 00:32:37.414
I think you were just trying
to get my attention,

00:32:37.497 --> 00:32:40.375
but you did need
for Derek to think that Maya was dead.

00:32:40.458 --> 00:32:42.794
[Matthew, distorted] This is the LAPD.
It's about Maya.

00:32:42.878 --> 00:32:45.672
'Cause he needed to be mad enough
to go kill Jason.

00:32:47.048 --> 00:32:48.049
Thus the blood.

00:32:48.133 --> 00:32:49.259
[chuckles]

00:32:49.342 --> 00:32:51.928
-I don't understand.
-Yeah, that happens a lot.

00:32:52.012 --> 00:32:53.221
Let me help you.

00:32:53.305 --> 00:32:56.016
Maya's blood was
on the dagger in her trunk,

00:32:56.099 --> 00:32:58.185
but Maya didn't have any cuts on her,

00:32:58.268 --> 00:33:00.729
so that leads me to ask myself,

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:03.190
where the heck
did that blood come from, right?

00:33:03.273 --> 00:33:07.485
And then I remembered, uh,
this guy is such a good guy

00:33:07.569 --> 00:33:09.613
he volunteers at his local hospital,

00:33:09.696 --> 00:33:12.949
the very same hospital
where Maya donated blood.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:22.375
Maybe your mom wasn't a thief,
but her son sure is.

00:33:22.459 --> 00:33:24.628
I was just texting with my partner.

00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:26.129
Yeah, they checked the footage
at the hospital.

00:33:26.213 --> 00:33:28.423
Sure enough, there you are,
stealing Maya's blood.

00:33:29.466 --> 00:33:32.844
So officers will be here any minute
to arrest you now,

00:33:32.928 --> 00:33:34.971
but I just wanted to make sure
that I got here first

00:33:35.055 --> 00:33:37.557
'cause I really wanted to see your face

00:33:37.641 --> 00:33:38.892
when you realized…

00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:41.353
you will end up in a cage.

00:33:45.732 --> 00:33:46.775
Well played.

00:33:57.452 --> 00:33:58.578

00:33:59.829 --> 00:34:00.872
She worked so hard.

00:34:01.665 --> 00:34:03.333

Gosh,

00:34:05.168 --> 00:34:07.045
I bet she would be so proud

00:34:07.128 --> 00:34:09.798
that you honored her memory
by harming another mom.

00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:12.467
I never hurt anyone.

00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:17.180

and taken away from her child?

You set him up to be killed.

I'm Arthur.

Okay, Arthur, you wanna tell me
why the hell you're at my kid's school

-and why you were using Roman's name?
-Take it easy.

00:40:33.348 --> 00:40:37.727
I'm here because he told me that you
were the one person he could trust,

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:41.272
but he also told me
that he can't trust law enforcement.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.692
-When did he tell you all of this?
-Last week.

00:40:45.902 --> 00:40:51.115

why the one person he's looking out for is

actually hanging out with the people
he's running from,

00:40:54.369 --> 00:40:55.578

The backpack you had in Nevada.

I saw a picture, and you had it,
and I know it wasn't yours.

Well, no Dodgers fan is gonna wear
an Angels pin

on the strap of their backpack.

That was Roman's team.

Plus, he never threw anything away.

00:41:18.351 --> 00:41:21.062
He wanted to fix it himself,
which explains the stitching on the seams.

So you think I stole his bag?

00:41:23.731 --> 00:41:26.401
Or he gave it to you. Either way,
I wanna know what was in the backpack.

I-I assume that was
why you were in Henderson, right?

to put eyes on you and Ava
