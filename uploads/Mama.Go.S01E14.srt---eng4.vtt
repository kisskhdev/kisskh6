00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.839
Recently, some internet users, via the platform,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.159
without any factual basis,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.159
engaged in groundless speculation,

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:35.759
publishing claims of mother-son incest,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.719
Kong Guifang's romance with a celebrity,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.840
and other malicious, slanderous, and false remarks.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.200
Furthermore, some of the content

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.520
has exceeded the limits of legally permissible commentary

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.960
and caused severe negative impacts.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.479
Next.

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.039
The defendant is hereby sentenced to delete the remarks

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.479
and apologize to the plaintiff.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.719
I'm sorry, Guifang.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.079
The internet is not a lawless zone.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.759
The public is requested not to readily believe rumors

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.920
and to jointly maintain a clean cyberspace.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.200
The legal interpretation of the Hubin District People's Court

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.400
carries legal force.

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:07.920
The execution period is seven days.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.439
Here, drink some water.

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.000
Is there anyone who hasn't come to apologize yet?

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.640
There are still a few putting up a desperate fight.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:22.200
Like this Zhao Chuyi.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.040
She has to bear the litigation costs.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.120
She'll probably face enforcement.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.280
This is the money I earned from working this month.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.120
I'll give you all my salary next month too.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.359
My mom is in poor health.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.599
Monthly medical bills drain our family's finances.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.840
I can't count on my dad.

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.680
I know I did wrong this time.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.799
But I just don't want my mom to know.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:43.319
I'm afraid it will break her heart.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.079
Although we've won now,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.000
we're also kind of notorious.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.239
The classmates who were

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:55.159
doing group projects with me before,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.959
now they don't dare to speak when they see me.

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.640
Everyone might be a bit afraid of Guifang,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.200
so they're afraid of us by association.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.560
It seems victory isn't as satisfying as imagined.

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:08.120
Ignore them.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.719
It's exam week recently.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.360
Everyone is under a bit of pressure.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.639
It'll be fine once it passes.

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.240
Everything will pass.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.680
Come on.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.199
Let's toast.

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.159
Cheers.

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:26.560
Xu Rui.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.680
Xu Rui!

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.240
Wait for me a second.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.719
Wait a second.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.560
No, listen.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.199
After you lectured me last time,

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.560
I really...

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.439
those celebrities and big bloggers I badmouthed,

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:35.680
I DM'd apologies to every single one of them.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.120
Take a look.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.919
Really, I know I was wrong.

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:37.639
Can you forgive me?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.439
Forgive me.

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:39.240
Please?

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.159
Just take a look.

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.960
Okay?

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:42.560
I really know I was wrong.

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.840
Can you give me a chance to be a good person?

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.759
Just look.

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:47.360
If you don't believe me, look first.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.879
Just look first.

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.960
Xu Rui.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.719
You...

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.000
Are you done talking?

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.680
No.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.280
Look, really look.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.599
I'm done.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.080
Goodnight.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.159
Did I let you leave?

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.960
I'll give you a chance to be a good person.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.759
You're the only one here?

00:03:58.919 --> 00:03:59.680
Fang'er, you came just in time.

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.360
Look.

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.360
The school decided to give those rumor-mongers

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.599
demerits.

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.120
Some even got major demerits.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.800
We've achieved a partial victory.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.840
This demerit...

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.919
will it affect their job hunting in the future?

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.519
Love is mutual honesty.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.639
With nothing to hide.

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:24.279
As long as there is deception,

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:25.720
love has a stain.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.399
Only by being open with each other

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.319
can love have a tomorrow.

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:31.319
This is my final speech.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.279
Thank you, everyone.

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:34.800
Okay, next student.

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:48.839
Hello everyone.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.680
I am Kong Guifang.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.319
The topic of my speech today is...

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:57.240
"Even a Hen Loves Herself."

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:04.240
When I was young,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.160
I was always taught to love others.

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:08.439
For parents,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.759
for children,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.600
to sacrifice and dedicate myself to family.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.879
Always putting others first,

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:16.680
and myself second.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.120
That is love.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.360
But I recently realized...

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.240
loving yourself...

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:25.600
is the most important thing.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.920
Only those who know how to love themselves...

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:31.079
can truly understand how to love others.

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:34.959
Even a hen knows...

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:37.879
you have to eat well to lay good eggs.

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:43.079
Did you apologize to her the other day?

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.319
Yeah. It was so embarrassing.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.879
She's unreal. Acting like nothing happened.

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.399
I feel awkward even if she doesn't.

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:05.079
Please put down your phones...

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.360
and listen to me for a moment.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.720
Since the court's verdict has been issued,

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.199
I won't hold onto the past either.

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:15.800
Now that everyone...

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.720
knows my real age and personality...

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.160
you might think I'm strange,

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:23.680
or even be a little afraid of me.

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:26.399
But I want to say...

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.319
this is the real Kong Guifang.

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:33.000
I have the marks left by time,

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.920
but I also enjoy the surprises of youth.

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:38.319
So from now on,

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.439
let's interact in a more authentic way.

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:42.120
Okay?

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.600
Okay!

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.879
Okay

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:58.920
Then I'll continue my speech

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.000
Hey there

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.000
Hey, are you okay?

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.759
Is... is it a stomachache?

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.959
Let's go. I'll take you to the infirmary right now

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.079
Slow down

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.000
No need

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:21.639
I don't want to be a bother

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.120
This is no time for that

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.800
Your health comes first

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:24.839
This child...

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:26.000
Let's go. Careful

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:29.680
Are you married?

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.639
No

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:36.959
Have you been sexually active recently?

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.519
No

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.360
Besides the stomach pain,

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:45.920
is there anywhere else that feels uncomfortable?

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:55.360
It's just... I've been squatting on the toilet,

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:56.439
and the longer I squat, the more it hurts

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.319
The cold air...

00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:59.000
just goes right up my butt

00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.839
The blood won't come down,

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:01.079
and nothing else comes out either

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:10.720
I'm sweating all over,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.519
rolling around in bed,

00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:13.480
feeling awful no matter what I do

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:14.399
I can't sit or stand comfortably

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.639
And inside my stomach,

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.959
it feels like it's churning

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:17.839
It's a cramping pain

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.199
Is that what it's like?

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:23.800
Then I know how to write it now

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.519
Thank you, thank you

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.600
I can handle it

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.160
I've got it

00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:31.879
Can you?

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:33.519
Thank you, Auntie

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.600
It's not like I eat children

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:43.399
That's 21.30 in total

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:45.399
Wait a minute, wait a minute

00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:48.720
This isn't even fresh anymore

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.559
And you're selling it for this much?

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:51.039
Aren't you just trying to fool a kid?

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.360
Th-th-this just came in today

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.559
Take two tangerines

00:08:54.279 --> 00:08:54.799
Eighteen in total

00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:57.039
You're getting new stock tomorrow anyway

00:08:57.039 --> 00:08:58.000
You won't be able to sell these

00:08:58.759 --> 00:08:59.360
Fine, fine then

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:01.320
Little girl sure knows how to bargain

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:02.679
What "little girl"?

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.200
I'm already a mother

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.279
Here

00:09:07.559 --> 00:09:08.360
I don't want it anymore

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:08.799
Thanks

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:13.879
She doesn't want this anymore. Look

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:15.320
I'll buy it, I'll buy it

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:16.279
I'll buy it. You buy it?

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:20.600
Guifang

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:22.279
Xiaorui

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.759
They're going to check dorms in your building soon too

00:09:23.759 --> 00:09:24.600
Let everyone know

00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:25.840
I'll get going then

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:26.919
Have some fruit

00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:27.759
No thanks. Bye-bye

00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:28.200
I'm off

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:28.759
Bye-bye. Bye-bye

00:09:41.159 --> 00:09:43.679
Zhuyun, notify the big group chat about the dorm check

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.240
I got kicked out

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:48.360
I won't do it. Serves them right

00:09:59.240 --> 00:09:59.799
Pass it back

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.679
Two sheets per person

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.720
Alright, the exam officially begins

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.360
Next pig, come here

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:40.960
Come on

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:41.440
Come

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.360
Why aren't you moving?

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.159
You have to struggle

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:49.600
Does he look like a pig?

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.320
He really does look like a pig

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.879
Stop laughing, stop laughing. It's an exam

00:10:54.559 --> 00:10:55.159
Read out the number

00:10:57.759 --> 00:10:59.600
117.4 kilograms

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:10.360
I caught it

00:11:10.759 --> 00:11:11.200
Look

00:11:13.919 --> 00:11:14.639
There's another one here

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:15.600
Another one. It's so small

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.320
Look

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:18.840
Caught it

00:11:19.159 --> 00:11:19.720
A caterpillar

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:20.919
Two of them

00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:22.159
Just a tiny one

00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:23.480
Yes, yes, yes, just like that

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.039
Where? Here

00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:32.919
Can't the Ag School be less rigid

00:11:32.919 --> 00:11:34.440
And a bit more irresponsible?

00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:36.200
I have never missed

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.000
Rote memorization exams so much

00:11:39.159 --> 00:11:40.720
I should have just guessed it was a pest earlier

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:41.879
Wake up

00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:43.320
Time for the next exam

00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:45.799
You know you need a GPA over 3.75

00:11:45.799 --> 00:11:47.039
To have a chance to transfer majors, right?

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.360
I overcame my fear, fought back the nausea

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:48.960
Went without sleep

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.639
And memorized the entire "Insect Taxonomy"

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.360
Even if you just gave me a silhouette

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.480
I could tell you this bug's

00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:54.600
Name and family

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.519
What its habits are

00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:56.679
Whether it's a pest or beneficial

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.960
I never expected the question to be

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:01.360
Who is the author of this book

00:12:03.879 --> 00:12:04.879
I wonder how Guifang is doing in there

00:12:04.879 --> 00:12:05.759
How her exam is going

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.919
This is a rhizome plant, right?

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.919
Isn't it a root system plant?

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.960
It's food. It's all food

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.159
Isn't this just a potato slice?

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.759
Can't you just stuff it in your mouth?

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.000
Stop discussing this stuff after the exam

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.960
Have mercy, guys

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:05.080
Asteraceae, Lactuca, annual herbaceous plant

00:13:06.879 --> 00:13:08.480
I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.320
Eat, eat, eat

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:10.720
Come on

00:13:12.039 --> 00:13:13.120
I feel like it's been a long time since

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.960
We've been this happy and relaxed

00:13:15.919 --> 00:13:16.360
Yeah

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.000
The battle is won

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.320
Major exams are done

00:13:19.879 --> 00:13:20.960
This semester is finally over too

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.039
This semester has been truly heart-stopping

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:25.840
Let's finish the remaining exams quickly

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.320
I can't wait to go back

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.279
And tell my mom

00:13:28.679 --> 00:13:30.080
Everything that happened to us this semester

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:34.840
Yeah

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.559
I want to go home

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:40.240
I miss my mom

00:14:27.879 --> 00:14:28.679
Dad, Mom

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.440
I brought your grandson to see you

00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:34.200
Thanks to your grandson

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.720
I can sort of live life over again now

00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:53.720
Last time

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.440
I always let myself be wronged

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:58.879
Not this time

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.080
Whether it's cyberbullying

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:03.960
Or

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.919
In my life

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.000
The inexplicable malice I receive

00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:12.039
Your daughter won't let herself be wronged anymore

00:15:18.799 --> 00:15:19.279
Mom

00:15:22.799 --> 00:15:24.240
Do you think even if we won

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.759
The hurt will disappear?

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:41.039
My grandma already answered you.

00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:42.960
Oranges.

00:15:44.039 --> 00:15:45.600
All the bickering will disappear.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.200
Right?

00:15:47.559 --> 00:15:48.399
Look at this apple.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.480
Everything will be safe and sound.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.360
And this banana.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.840
To teach them a lesson.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.200
So life will be sweet.

00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:56.639
This candle.

00:15:56.879 --> 00:15:57.759
Mom in the candlelight.

00:16:00.519 --> 00:16:00.879
Right?

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:06.799
So tell me.

00:16:07.039 --> 00:16:08.879
Do you think Grandma and the others understand what "cyberbullying" is?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.720
I burned a laptop for them.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.679
They can understand.

00:16:13.159 --> 00:16:14.000
Then did you burn a network cable?

00:16:15.559 --> 00:16:17.279
Everyone uses Wi-Fi now. Who uses cables?

00:16:17.919 --> 00:16:18.559
True.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.240
Mom.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.399
If back then...

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.840
I could be like I am now...

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.799
That would have been so good.

00:16:32.039 --> 00:16:34.080
That way, when you were bullied...

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.080
I could have protected you.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:37.799
How great that would be.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.559
People only... when they see their mom...

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.600
...reveal their truest vulnerability.

00:16:48.679 --> 00:16:49.919
I told you to study in the car.

00:16:49.919 --> 00:16:51.000
Did you read? Did you memorize?

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.600
You're going to cram at the last minute again.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.360
Are you a demon, Mom?

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.080
Who studies in a car?

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.320
Wouldn't that make you carsick and dizzy?

00:16:56.559 --> 00:16:57.480
If I were a demon...

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.799
Then you'd be the son of a demon.

00:16:58.799 --> 00:16:59.559
Just wait until you fail.

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:00.720
You're getting more and more humorous.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:01.919
I'm going to take out the trash.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.200
Study, you hear me?

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.400
Read the book. Memorize it for me.

00:17:04.759 --> 00:17:05.880
You have to imprint it in your brain, you know?

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.279
Kong Xiaocan.

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:26.079
You finally decided to show up.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.079
Do you know how long I've been looking for you?

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.200
I was on annual leave.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.920
I only get five days of annual leave a year.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.519
The year after next, I'll have ten days.

00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:33.960
I don't care how many days you have.

00:17:34.079 --> 00:17:35.200
Do you know how chaotic it was recently?

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.279
You didn't show up when I needed you.

00:17:37.119 --> 00:17:39.160
That's exactly why I'm looking for you, hun.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.880
According to our deal...

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.920
Article 53, Section 4.

00:17:43.079 --> 00:17:44.920
You are suspected of violating the rules.

00:17:45.559 --> 00:17:46.599
But luckily...

00:17:46.759 --> 00:17:50.000
The information you leaked didn't concern me.

00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:53.119
But a punishment will still be imposed on you.

00:17:55.039 --> 00:17:55.920
There's a punishment?

00:17:56.039 --> 00:17:56.920
As for the content of the punishment...

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.160
We will hold an internal meeting to decide.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.240
We'll notify you then.

00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:01.119
But what I can tell you is...

00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:02.880
It will definitely be something you humans...

00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:05.680
...do not want to see.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.240
I'll come call you when it's decided.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.200
I'm off then. Bye-bye.

00:18:16.279 --> 00:18:17.599
Something we don't want to see...

00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:19.519
A punishment we don't want to see.

00:18:22.319 --> 00:18:22.599
Wait.

00:18:29.519 --> 00:18:29.960
Left again?

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:30.599
Come out.

00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:32.119
Come out, A Fu.

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:33.759
Come out!

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:35.279
Come out quick!

00:18:35.599 --> 00:18:37.359
Xiaocan, what are you doing?

00:18:38.319 --> 00:18:40.039
Will shouting make the bottles come out?

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.480
You have to pick them up.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:44.240
Hold this.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:45.640
Cockroach.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.400
I hate seeing these things the most.

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:50.119
It will definitely be something you humans...

00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:52.839
...do not want to see.

00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:30.680
The natural enemy of mankind.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:45.920
Are you still eating?

00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:47.400
If not, I'll eat it.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.519
Are you a pig?

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:53.960
Isn't this your idol?

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.920
Can't you learn from him?

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.559
Have some depth.

00:19:55.559 --> 00:19:56.680
You just stuff your face whenever you see food.

00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:00.039
It's precisely because I'm in front of my idol...

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.240
...that showing my sincerity is how I respect him.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.079
Alright, alright, alright. I get it.

00:20:02.079 --> 00:20:02.759
Okay, I know.

00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:06.480
I was thinking...

00:20:07.079 --> 00:20:08.240
I was at the fruit shop earlier,

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.279
and I saw Godmom haggling there.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.720
She's just as imposing as ever.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.319
Yeah.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.640
That's who I was telling you about.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.240
Wait a second.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:14.920
Hold on.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.319
That's not right.

00:20:18.119 --> 00:20:19.440
Haven't I seen Godmom when she was old?

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.640
What's this about looking old when young,

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.680
and looking young when old?

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.759
You're messing with me, aren't you?

00:20:23.119 --> 00:20:23.839
What is actually going on?

00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:26.920
Your idol must be working miracles.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.839
You've started using your brain.

00:20:27.839 --> 00:20:28.319
Hurry up.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.559
Isn't that what I was about to tell you?

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:31.680
You kept interrupting me.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.039
How should I put this?

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.480
My family has a genetic mutation.

00:20:44.839 --> 00:20:45.599
My mom is like this now,

00:20:45.599 --> 00:20:46.680
and when I get to her age,

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.079
I might just turn into...

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.000
a cockroach.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.400
For real?

00:20:55.519 --> 00:20:56.559
Cockroaches are great.

00:20:57.079 --> 00:20:58.000
They're resilient.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:58.880
They live a long time.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.559
You actually believe that?

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.519
Look at what happened to Godmom.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.960
Is there anything left I wouldn't believe?

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:05.160
Alright.

00:21:06.119 --> 00:21:06.960
Then I'll tell you the truth.

00:21:12.519 --> 00:21:13.599
My mom took a special drug.

00:21:15.319 --> 00:21:17.240
She was pretty sick back then,

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.759
so we tried a desperate measure.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.240
She joined a drug trial

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.119
as a guinea pig.

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:22.480
I didn't expect the results to be so...

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.440
But you can't say a word.

00:21:24.599 --> 00:21:25.799
We signed a confidentiality agreement.

00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:27.160
Just you, me, and him know about this.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.720
It'd be really bad for my mom if anyone else knew.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:30.920
Brother.

00:21:32.079 --> 00:21:33.440
I swear in front of my idol.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.519
I won't tell a soul.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:35.799
Good.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:37.640
And...

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.480
if one day you turn into a cockroach,

00:21:40.559 --> 00:21:41.200
come find me.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:43.799
I'll take care of you.

00:21:49.519 --> 00:21:49.960
Well,

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:51.880
what if...

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.319
it's not a cockroach?

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:54.839
No snakes.

00:21:56.039 --> 00:21:56.680
You know me.

00:21:57.599 --> 00:21:58.240
Caterpillars.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.440
You know the smell of stink bugs.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.359
Centipedes.

00:22:01.559 --> 00:22:02.240
Mole crickets.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.680
Your standards are pretty specific.

00:22:03.759 --> 00:22:04.279
Is there anything decent?

00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:05.319
No butterflies.

00:22:05.319 --> 00:22:05.920
Get lost, I'm allergic.

00:22:08.039 --> 00:22:08.400
Xiaocan.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.680
How about a dragonfly nymph?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.839
A dragonfly nymph works.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.559
How's a dragonfly nymph?

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.599
Mom, Mom, Mom, that's enough

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.799
Mom, Mom, okay, okay

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:47.839
You... that's enough, alright

00:22:47.839 --> 00:22:48.680
You are too cruel

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.720
You have to live and let live

00:22:50.039 --> 00:22:51.319
It's all squashed and oozing

00:22:52.599 --> 00:22:53.119
Mom, Mom

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.079
I'm telling you very seriously

00:22:57.079 --> 00:22:58.039
If one day

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.000
I'm not by your side anymore...

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.480
Please, you must treat the small animals around you kindly

00:23:04.519 --> 00:23:05.000
Okay?

00:23:05.559 --> 00:23:06.640
No, wait, what are you doing now?

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.200
What I'm doing isn't important

00:23:09.279 --> 00:23:10.279
The main thing is the second part

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:12.359
You must treat the cockroaches around you kindly

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.960
Including snakes, caterpillars...

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.519
Mole crickets, stink bugs...

00:23:16.599 --> 00:23:17.440
Dragonfly nymphs, and so on

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.480
What even are these things?

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.599
It's life!

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.519
Mom, please don't kill living things anymore, okay?

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.519
Life isn't easy

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.000
What I want to say is...

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.200
You never know which comes first, tomorrow or an accident

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.319
Every step you take might make you regret it for...

00:23:31.759 --> 00:23:32.119
Mom!

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:33.319
Mom!

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:34.960
Where are you going?

00:23:35.799 --> 00:23:36.400
Where are you going?

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:37.759
Mom!

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.920
Mom, who is this?

00:23:56.799 --> 00:23:58.680
Talking to the Du University Bot, Zhao Chuyi

00:24:00.279 --> 00:24:01.839
You're coming straight to the door to collect a debt?

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.480
Shut up. Follow me

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.240
I'm back

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.400
Sis, Sis, you're back

00:24:29.519 --> 00:24:30.319
Did you miss me?

00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:31.240
Yes

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.359
You've folded so many

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:34.839
Did you finish your homework?

00:24:34.839 --> 00:24:35.759
Finished, finished

00:24:36.119 --> 00:24:37.519
Such a good little darling

00:24:37.599 --> 00:24:38.759
There's a reward

00:24:39.119 --> 00:24:40.240
Thank you, sister. Thank you, sister

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.319
Have it after you finish your meal

00:24:41.759 --> 00:24:42.160
Okay

00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:48.680
Hello

00:24:49.319 --> 00:24:51.119
May I ask who you are looking for?

00:24:58.759 --> 00:24:59.680
How did you find this place?

00:25:01.079 --> 00:25:01.720
I've already apologized.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.400
I've pinned the post too.

00:25:02.839 --> 00:25:03.759
Do you still want money?

00:25:04.319 --> 00:25:05.279
There's no way I can pay you.

00:25:07.119 --> 00:25:08.799
You were the one leading the cyberbullying, right?

00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:09.519
Right now, you...

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.680
That's a different matter.

00:25:11.559 --> 00:25:13.039
We aren't here to ask for money.

00:25:14.319 --> 00:25:15.200
I don't care what you're here for.

00:25:16.039 --> 00:25:16.920
Please leave immediately.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:19.559
Sis.

00:25:20.319 --> 00:25:21.279
Did you do something bad?

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.119
My sister is the best.

00:25:23.119 --> 00:25:24.319
She couldn't have done anything bad.

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:28.920
Your sister did do something bad.

00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:33.759
But she has changed.

00:25:35.279 --> 00:25:36.240
We are friends now.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.359
You are looking for...

00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:45.720
Chuyi, you're back.

00:25:46.079 --> 00:25:46.839
Who are they?

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:47.680
Mom.

00:25:48.759 --> 00:25:49.519
They are...

00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:51.839
They're my classmates.

00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:53.160
Classmates?

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.960
Come, come in and sit.

00:25:55.279 --> 00:25:56.240
Come on, hurry.

00:25:56.359 --> 00:25:57.599
Careful, take it easy.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.160
I'm fine, Auntie.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:25:59.960
Come, sit, sit.

00:26:00.039 --> 00:26:00.599
Okay, okay.

00:26:00.599 --> 00:26:03.160
This is the first time Chuyi has brought classmates home.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:03.640
Really?

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.559
Shiwu, Duoduo.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.279
Go buy something good to eat.

00:26:08.279 --> 00:26:08.839
Okay, thanks Sis.

00:26:08.839 --> 00:26:09.319
Go on now.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:09.960
Let's go, Duoduo.

00:26:10.319 --> 00:26:10.920
What do you want to eat?

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:14.480
You can dodge Chuyi, but you can't dodge Shiwu.

00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:18.240
Please, have a seat.

00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:18.880
Sit.

00:26:19.279 --> 00:26:19.759
Okay, Auntie.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.559
The house is a mess.

00:26:22.079 --> 00:26:23.240
Please don't mind it.

00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:24.519
Mom, stop bustling around.

00:26:24.759 --> 00:26:25.200
It's fine.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.960
You all just finished exams, right?

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:27.960
Must be really tired.

00:26:28.519 --> 00:26:29.240
It was okay.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.279
I'll do it, I'll do it.

00:26:31.519 --> 00:26:31.920
Have some water.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:32.279
Thanks.

00:26:32.279 --> 00:26:33.440
Thanks, thank you Auntie, thank you.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.960
How did Chuyi do on the exams this time?

00:26:39.839 --> 00:26:40.480
Pretty good.

00:26:40.839 --> 00:26:42.880
Senior Chuyi's grades have always been good.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:43.640
Is that so?

00:26:43.839 --> 00:26:44.400
Mom.

00:26:44.839 --> 00:26:46.000
Just ask me.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.200
When I ask you, you never tell me.

00:26:48.839 --> 00:26:50.720
This child never tells me anything.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.880
As you can see.

00:26:52.039 --> 00:26:54.079
Our family isn't very well off.

00:26:54.519 --> 00:26:55.799
My health isn't good either.

00:26:56.519 --> 00:26:59.680
Chuyi has to work part-time after school.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.400
In the future...

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.839
I have to ask you to help her out more.

00:27:03.359 --> 00:27:03.799
Mom.

00:27:03.799 --> 00:27:04.279
Of course, Auntie.

00:27:04.279 --> 00:27:04.799
We will.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.640
I really want to thank you.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:07.880
It's nothing, Auntie.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:11.759
Who are you two?

00:27:12.519 --> 00:27:13.720
She's Chuyi's classmate.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.960
Chuyi, Chuyi is back.

00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:17.960
My eldest daughter is back.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.039
You...

00:27:25.319 --> 00:27:25.759
Listen,

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.680
I've got some good news for you two.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.319
Old Wang has this project.

00:27:30.759 --> 00:27:31.960
I got him to save me a share.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.119
With this project,

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.599
if I can get on board,

00:27:35.799 --> 00:27:37.359
I'll make at least this much in a year.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.880
Isn't it perfect? It's the end of the term.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.200
Didn't that scholarship come through?

00:27:43.359 --> 00:27:45.240
Fork it over. Dad will let you in on the action.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:45.880
How about it?

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.880
My grades went down.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.279
There's no scholarship.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:51.839
None.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.920
Wait, not a single cent?

00:27:56.759 --> 00:27:57.960
Or did your mom tell you something?

00:27:58.119 --> 00:27:58.720
There really isn't any.

00:27:59.759 --> 00:28:00.480
Ask them if you don't believe me.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:02.400
Yeah.

00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:04.960
The senior projects were really hard this year.

00:28:05.119 --> 00:28:07.039
The competition for scholarships is fierce.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.559
Yeah, yeah. It's a bit of a pity.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.880
Save your breath.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.319
So you didn't bring back a single cent, did you?

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.720
What goes through your head all day?

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.240
You can't even earn that little bit of money.

00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:18.519
What's the use of going to that lousy school?

00:28:18.759 --> 00:28:19.839
Watch your mouth!

00:28:20.359 --> 00:28:21.880
What gives you the right to scold my daughter?

00:28:22.319 --> 00:28:24.000
Chuyi works so hard to support this family.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.920
When have you ever brought a cent back?

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.920
You're asking for it!

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.000
What are you doing? Hitting people?

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.839
Hey! Hey!

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.440
What do you think you're doing?

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.200
I'm calling the police! What era is this?

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:31.839
Go ahead, hit me!

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:32.799
Just try it!

00:28:40.319 --> 00:28:40.720
Okay

00:28:41.599 --> 00:28:42.759
Wait until those two are gone

00:28:44.599 --> 00:28:45.720
You still have the nerve to cry

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.680
Couldn't give me a son

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:48.880
Can't make any money

00:28:49.359 --> 00:28:50.640
Long face every single day

00:28:50.839 --> 00:28:52.640
Sickly all the time, I have to spend money on you

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:53.759
Seriously, I...

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:54.680
Marrying you...

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.240
...was the worst luck of my life, I'm telling you

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:56.680
Yes

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.519
When it comes to fortune...

00:28:58.839 --> 00:28:59.920
...it is quite mysterious

00:29:01.079 --> 00:29:02.640
One reading defines heaven and earth

00:29:03.079 --> 00:29:04.559
The universe is revealed in the face

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:09.880
What the hell? All mystical

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.319
What did you say?

00:29:12.039 --> 00:29:13.680
W-What? You know how to tell fortunes?

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.960
It's passed down in the family

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.559
I know a bit about face reading

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:18.920
Oh my god

00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:21.680
This guy is young but talks big

00:29:21.839 --> 00:29:23.079
And he can actually calculate fortune?

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.160
Come, come. Take a look at mine then

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:24.920
Come here, come over here

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:29.000
Well, yours is...

00:29:30.839 --> 00:29:31.400
Dog nose

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.759
Who are you cursing at?

00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:33.680
Dog nose

00:29:33.839 --> 00:29:34.559
A dog's nose

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.039
I'm telling you, the tip is round

00:29:36.039 --> 00:29:36.880
The wings are broad

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.359
It signifies wealth

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.759
It shows your Wealth Palace is very prosperous

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:41.359
Wealth?

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.240
Lots of money. It means lots of money, understand?

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.319
I get it, I get it. Yes

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.839
You... How about this...

00:29:47.839 --> 00:29:49.000
Take a good look for me

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.240
H-How can I make even more money?

00:29:53.519 --> 00:29:54.599
A person like you...

00:29:55.799 --> 00:29:56.920
...you have to go North

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:57.960
The North brings you luck

00:29:58.519 --> 00:30:00.000
North? Where... where is North?

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:02.880
Up is North, down is...

00:30:03.319 --> 00:30:04.079
N-No, that's not right

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.000
Anyway, the further North, the better

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.240
Further North is better?

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.200
You see...

00:30:08.839 --> 00:30:09.480
Not South

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.319
Not South

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.519
Not East or West

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.240
Not East or West

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.680
Just North

00:30:13.759 --> 00:30:14.599
Must... must be North

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.359
Must be North

00:30:17.119 --> 00:30:18.599
Must be North. Then in the North...

00:30:19.279 --> 00:30:21.160
What's in the North?

00:30:23.119 --> 00:30:23.640
I know!

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.880
Old Wang's project is in the North!

00:30:26.839 --> 00:30:28.319
You're pretty good!

00:30:28.319 --> 00:30:28.920
This guy...

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.160
Your classmate is better than you, I tell you

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:32.799
Come hang out often!

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.079
I gotta tell him right away

00:30:35.839 --> 00:30:36.680
We're back

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.559
Old Wang

00:30:39.119 --> 00:30:39.920
About that project of yours...

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.039
Let me have some

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.759
We bought that

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.039
I'm your father

00:30:44.039 --> 00:30:45.359
So what if I eat a bite of your food?

00:30:46.079 --> 00:30:47.359
No, I wasn't scolding you

00:30:47.359 --> 00:30:47.920
No

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.759
I'm not your dad

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.759
Guifang, you're becoming more and more like me

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.200
Lying right off the bat

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.519
Face reading, really?

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.240
What did you call me?

00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:58.400
What did you call me?

00:30:58.799 --> 00:30:59.559
No respect

00:30:59.559 --> 00:31:00.279
No respect

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.839
You're calling me Guifang again?

00:31:01.839 --> 00:31:02.759
Wasn't I quick just now?

00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:04.759
Auntie, sorry you had to see that

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.039
It's usually like this

00:31:08.559 --> 00:31:09.279
Today...

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:10.559
...thank you guys

00:31:13.119 --> 00:31:14.240
Your family has it tough too

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.880
It won't always be this hard

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:19.920
No matter what...

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.440
...I will definitely change our life

00:31:25.839 --> 00:31:26.759
Change it completely

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.640
You mean

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.039
leave him

00:31:35.839 --> 00:31:36.799
It seems you've thought about it

00:31:41.079 --> 00:31:41.720
It's hard

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.880
As long as you're determined

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:47.880
Actually, leaving

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.160
is just a matter of a moment

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.599
Take the most important things

00:31:54.759 --> 00:31:56.880
Buy a ticket, get on the train

00:31:57.799 --> 00:31:58.480
go to a

00:31:59.319 --> 00:32:00.559
place where he can't find you

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.200
Start over

00:32:12.119 --> 00:32:13.279
Once you leave, don't come back

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.279
Let me write you an IOU

00:32:32.599 --> 00:32:33.279
What IOU?

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:34.920
Your legal fees

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.400
After I graduate

00:32:38.079 --> 00:32:39.319
I'll take Mom and my sister

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.880
settle down in another city

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:43.039
When I find a job and stabilize

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.519
I'll pay you back the money I owe

00:32:46.319 --> 00:32:47.160
What I should bear

00:32:48.559 --> 00:32:49.160
I will bear

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:52.559
Okay

00:32:59.440 --> 00:32:59.799
Mom

00:33:00.839 --> 00:33:01.359
Eat the egg, eat the egg

00:33:01.359 --> 00:33:01.880
No need, no need

00:33:02.079 --> 00:33:02.759
You eat, I fried two

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.720
They... they're all yours

00:33:03.759 --> 00:33:04.440
Today they're all yours

00:33:04.759 --> 00:33:05.640
So filial today?

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.000
My mom is cool today too

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:08.880
Excessively cool

00:33:09.319 --> 00:33:10.200
Let me peel an egg for you then

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.640
Those who have lived through hard times

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.920
have to understand each other

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:17.880
Mom

00:33:19.279 --> 00:33:20.279
I see that you really are...

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.039
No matter how much suffering

00:33:22.039 --> 00:33:23.160
you can carry through it

00:33:23.799 --> 00:33:24.960
When you live long enough

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.200
you just have this bit of

00:33:27.079 --> 00:33:28.000
calmness amidst change

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.160
Don't say that

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.759
You're young now too

00:33:30.759 --> 00:33:32.240
A young person, okay?

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.880
Anyway, I've figured it out now

00:33:39.039 --> 00:33:39.759
Before

00:33:40.839 --> 00:33:42.559
I was always pretending to be young

00:33:43.559 --> 00:33:44.440
But as I kept acting

00:33:45.599 --> 00:33:47.440
I really forgot my real age

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.160
But actually my past

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.200
everything I've been through along the way

00:33:52.799 --> 00:33:54.240
is what I should cherish the most

00:33:56.039 --> 00:33:56.799
I am me

00:33:57.319 --> 00:33:58.880
I am Kong Guifang

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.240
A different kind of firework

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:10.760
Eat an egg

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.079
Look how worth it the youth I traded for my mom is

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:21.519
Whether I turn into a cockroach or a mouse

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.480
Even if the price is death

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.079
To see my mom's smile today

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:26.840
It was worth it

00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:28.880
Kong Xiaocan

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.199
Well done

00:34:35.559 --> 00:34:36.320
Gosh

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:38.119
These plane tickets are too expensive

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.519
They're all full price

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.480
Do workers go home this early?

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.119
Tell me about it

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.199
These high-speed rail accelerator packs

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:45.079
I don't know how many I bought

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.199
I'm still on the waitlist

00:34:46.519 --> 00:34:47.079
That's all useless

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.960
Hainan tickets have skyrocketed

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.079
Can tourists please give way

00:34:53.079 --> 00:34:54.000
to people going home?

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.280
Professor Wang asked me to pass on a message

00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.599
Asking you to find time tomorrow afternoon

00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:00.400
to go to her office

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:02.960
Why is she looking for me?

00:35:04.039 --> 00:35:05.239
I didn't fail her class

00:35:06.599 --> 00:35:08.559
Scraping by is still passing

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.039
Rest assured

00:35:11.039 --> 00:35:12.599
Her project involves jackfruit

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.760
She probably just wants to contact your family

00:35:15.719 --> 00:35:16.039
By the way

00:35:16.519 --> 00:35:18.239
Xiaotian asked me today

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.519
if we want to go to the karaoke room together

00:35:19.719 --> 00:35:20.760
Said to relax after exams

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:21.559
Really?

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.960
Karaoke room? That's great!

00:35:23.719 --> 00:35:25.280
That's great!

00:35:26.599 --> 00:35:27.840
Karaoke room, karaoke room

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.360
Listen to me, everyone

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.400
Listen to me, listen to me

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.119
I...

00:36:11.199 --> 00:36:11.840
Kong Guifang...

00:36:13.159 --> 00:36:15.239
fought a beautiful turnaround battle this time

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.920
Some people like it

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:21.880
Some people understand

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.159
And some people misunderstand

00:36:23.719 --> 00:36:24.280
But...

00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:25.960
that is life

00:36:27.159 --> 00:36:29.480
I'm lucky to have you good friends

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.880
And my good friend

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.800
My son

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.360
And my son

00:36:34.639 --> 00:36:35.360
Cheers

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:35.920
Cheers

00:36:38.159 --> 00:36:38.960
Cheers

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.079
Done with training?

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.679
Do you want me to pick you up?

00:36:45.639 --> 00:36:46.760
It's fine, you guys go ahead and have fun

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.159
I'll come by myself later

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.320
Like this?

00:36:52.519 --> 00:36:52.960
Right

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.039
I can do it, I can do it

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:57.920
Come on, come on

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:58.880
Coming, coming

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.039
Like this?

00:37:07.199 --> 00:37:08.199
Let's do one together

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:08.760
Xiaoyin

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.320
One more

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:09.880
Again, again

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:10.599
Xiaotian

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.519
Look how pretty she is

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:14.679
Drink, drink some

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.440
Brother Xiaocan

00:37:30.079 --> 00:37:31.719
I really, really admire her

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:34.719
Brave

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.519
Smart

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.480
Very independent

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:40.960
Great execution

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.199
The key is...

00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:45.280
she's also very beautiful

00:37:50.559 --> 00:37:52.079
I really like her

00:37:54.039 --> 00:37:54.960
cooking

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.920
I want to eat it for every meal

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:57.719
Good, this is good

00:37:57.719 --> 00:37:59.119
Just don't... don't say any more

00:38:02.039 --> 00:38:03.320
But she doesn't like me

00:38:07.039 --> 00:38:07.559
Mingtian

00:38:08.159 --> 00:38:09.559
You... you are a good person

00:38:10.679 --> 00:38:13.039
But if you want to be my stepdad

00:38:13.039 --> 00:38:14.599
that is absolutely impossible

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.039
However...

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.239
just for the fact that you admire my mom...

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.239
I'll toast to you

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:23.119
Come on

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:24.760
Drink

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.119
Drink

00:38:25.119 --> 00:38:25.719
Just drink

00:38:25.719 --> 00:38:26.719
Don't... don't look

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.719
Fang'er

00:39:04.639 --> 00:39:07.280
Fang'er, I have a secret to tell you.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.400
Let me tell you.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.719
I've never told anyone this secret before.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.159
This is the first time I'm telling you.

00:39:13.159 --> 00:39:14.920
You absolutely cannot tell anyone else.

00:39:15.719 --> 00:39:16.840
I'm too embarrassed to say it.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:17.599
What?

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.480
I used to like your son.

00:39:27.239 --> 00:39:28.239
Don't look at me.

00:39:28.239 --> 00:39:29.119
I knew it.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.000
I'm dying of embarrassment.

00:39:31.239 --> 00:39:33.039
I was out of my mind back then.

00:39:33.039 --> 00:39:34.119
Seeing him bleed for me...

00:39:34.119 --> 00:39:35.760
I just suddenly got carried away.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.159
I didn't know he and Xu Rui were a couple then.

00:39:38.239 --> 00:39:40.000
Otherwise, I wouldn't have liked him.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.119
When will it be my turn for a sweet romance?

00:39:44.239 --> 00:39:45.599
Alright, alright, alright.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.199
Let me tell you, Xiaoyin.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.599
You...

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.800
Are wonderful.

00:39:50.039 --> 00:39:50.679
Trust me.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.880
Someday...

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.000
You will meet the person who belongs to you.

00:39:54.719 --> 00:39:55.840
Really, trust me.

00:39:56.119 --> 00:39:56.599
Really.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.280
Really.

00:39:58.119 --> 00:39:59.920
You are the best.

00:40:01.719 --> 00:40:02.800
I am the best.

00:40:03.159 --> 00:40:04.920
You are the cutest.

00:40:05.159 --> 00:40:06.320
I am the cutest.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.320
You are the most beautiful.

00:40:07.719 --> 00:40:10.000
I am the most beautiful.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.400
My good mom.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.199
Coming home after work.

00:40:15.559 --> 00:40:17.960
Working all day long.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.280
How hard it must be.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.000
Mom.

00:40:22.039 --> 00:40:22.519
Mom.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.320
Come, come here, Mom.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.599
Mom, Mom, sit down quickly.

00:40:26.599 --> 00:40:28.000
Good mom, Mom.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.880
Please have a cup of tea.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.639
Let me kiss you.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.039
Let me kiss you, my good mom.

00:40:36.599 --> 00:40:39.039
Coming home after work, my good mom.

00:40:41.039 --> 00:40:43.320
Good mom.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.719
Mom, Mom, sit down quickly.

00:40:47.039 --> 00:40:48.840
Please have a cup of tea.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.960
They're all wasted.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.719
Are you coming after training?

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.320
Almost there.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.360
Let me kiss you.

00:40:54.559 --> 00:40:56.679
My good mom.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.400
My good mom.

00:41:11.079 --> 00:41:13.280
Working all day long.

00:41:20.519 --> 00:41:21.920
No, wait, what do you want with me?

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.280
The content of the punishment has been decided.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.199
If there are no issues, let's begin.

00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:28.840
R-Right now, right here?

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.519
Dear.

00:41:29.639 --> 00:41:31.960
We do not accept rescheduling.

00:41:32.119 --> 00:41:33.639
Everyone is very busy.

00:41:38.719 --> 00:41:39.199
Then...

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.039
Then, c-can you...

00:41:41.559 --> 00:41:43.400
Just let me mentally prepare myself?

00:41:44.119 --> 00:41:45.360
Since you are already prepared...

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.199
Then...

00:41:46.199 --> 00:41:47.199
No, I'm not prepared!

00:41:47.199 --> 00:41:48.039
I need to prepare a bit!

00:41:48.039 --> 00:41:49.840
At least let me sober up first!

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.400
Since you have already sobered up...

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.679
I haven't... Why don't you listen?

00:41:52.679 --> 00:41:54.440
I said give me some time, can't you?

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.639
There is no time left.

00:41:55.639 --> 00:41:56.800
Okay, okay, okay, you just...

00:41:57.039 --> 00:41:58.400
Just reveal a few details...

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.639
It's over.

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.039
It's over.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.199
I didn't turn into a cockroach.

00:42:19.199 --> 00:42:20.199
Seems like nothing's wrong.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.199
It's just the hair is gone.

00:42:32.039 --> 00:42:33.920
Dear, the content of your punishment was...

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.400
We removed all your hair.

00:42:36.639 --> 00:42:37.760
And we did a painless treatment while at it.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.760
Hope you can give a five-star review, Dear.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.639
Are you crazy?

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.679
That's a truly civilized five-star review.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.199
So? Feel better after venting?

00:43:22.559 --> 00:43:23.639
I actually do feel a bit better.

00:43:24.599 --> 00:43:25.000
Wait.

00:43:25.519 --> 00:43:26.400
What kind of sick taste is that?

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.840
You aliens are sick in the head. Why...

00:43:28.119 --> 00:43:30.280
Only you humans get sick.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.320
We do not get sick.

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.239
So you are the one who is sick.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:34.920
Right. I'll take my leave now.

00:43:36.199 --> 00:43:36.679
Wait a minute.

00:43:39.199 --> 00:43:40.679
I'm asking you a serious question.

00:43:42.199 --> 00:43:42.920
Let's say...

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:44.719
regarding the exchange for my mom

00:43:44.719 --> 00:43:46.119
of fifty years of life energy...

00:43:47.599 --> 00:43:49.280
if someone accidentally found out...

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.480
would the person who knows get punished?

00:43:51.559 --> 00:43:53.159
Would my mom suffer any...

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.039
Are you sure it was accidental?

00:43:57.039 --> 00:43:57.719
Just tell me.

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:01.079
If only a very small number of people know,

00:44:01.239 --> 00:44:03.159
then only you will be punished.

00:44:03.239 --> 00:44:04.800
The ones who know will not be.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.039
But it is worth noting that...

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.880
if it causes a huge impact on society,

00:44:10.079 --> 00:44:12.719
and our existence becomes known to many,

00:44:13.199 --> 00:44:13.840
then...

00:44:14.079 --> 00:44:15.159
you may have to endure...

00:44:15.199 --> 00:44:17.760
a very, very severe punishment.

00:44:18.559 --> 00:44:20.559
Don't give me that scaremongering crap.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.400
You said it was serious last time too.

00:44:23.519 --> 00:44:24.639
How come it was painless hair removal this time?

00:44:24.639 --> 00:44:25.679
Will you shorten my height next time?

00:44:26.199 --> 00:44:26.880
That is also possible.

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.039
I shall take my leave now.

00:44:28.119 --> 00:44:28.400
Wait!

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:28.719
Goodbye.

00:44:28.719 --> 00:44:29.559
That wouldn't be good.

00:44:29.559 --> 00:44:30.320
I'm still trying to date here.
