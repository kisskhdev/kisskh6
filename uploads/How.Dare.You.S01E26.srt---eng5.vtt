Five stars aligning

this kind of celestial phenomenon.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.000
when I visited the Yu Residence,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.660
he was the one who received me.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.000
Minister Yu,

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.260
why are you framing me?

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:04.670
Your Majesty!

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:05.750
I...

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.770
know nothing about this!

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.000
Th-There...

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:10.980
must be...

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.360
some misunderstandings!

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.750
Your Majesty!

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.880
Minister Yu!

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.130
You usually seem so honest,

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.240
yet you're connected to assassins

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.790
and trying to pin this on Prince Duan!

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.030
What are your intentions?

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.600
Lord Cao!

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.120
Don't talk nonsense!

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:25.780
Minister Yu

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.790
has never been involved
in factional disputes.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.600
How could he suddenly be connected
to assassins?

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.130
Exactly!

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.440
Besides, Minister Yu
just became the Imperial Father-in-law.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.040
Giving up his family's glory

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.880
and conspiring with a traitor
to kill the Emperor?

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:38.670
Has he lost his mind?

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.720
You can know a person's face,
but not their heart.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.150
To know the truth,

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:43.910
we should ask Zhao Wucheng.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.800
Zhao Wucheng,

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.030
what's your explanation?

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:48.870
I told you,

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.390
I did it for myself.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.050
You didn't believe me,

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.180
and forced me to accuse someone else.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.750
I accused Prince Duan,

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.840
yet you didn't believe that either.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.480
You, as an emperor,

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.510
are truly hard to please.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.700
No wonder the one I love

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.840
is trying everything to kill you.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:11.740
Outrageous!

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.600
How dare you speak to His Majesty
like that?

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.470
Commander Fu.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:16.480
Yes.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:17.720
Search him.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:18.270
Yes.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:21.180
Stop!

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:21.960
Don't move!

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:30.900
[Ever since we met
at the New Year flower market,]

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:31.360
[I haven't been able to forget you]

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.280
[I know your feelings for me.
Yet I'm entering]

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.300
[the palace tomorrow,
and we'll hardly meet again]

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:36.710
Your Majesty,

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.560
These are some love letters

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.610
between him...

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.620
and a woman.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.610
And this is a...

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.230
uniquely embroidered sachet.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.660
Are these

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.340
truly written by Consort Yu?

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:04.170
Yes.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.510
Even this sachet

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:10.890
was embroidered by her own hands for me.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.700
The fabric of this sachet

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.760
is silk tribute from Qiang State.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:16.290
But this...

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.260
This was only given to the consorts
in the harem.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.360
And this letter paper
also looks like it's from the palace.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.370
Could it be...

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.070
that Zhao Wucheng

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.600
is involved

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.260
with a palace consort?

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.880
Shameless Zhao Wucheng!

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.610
We can easily verify

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.740
who this evidence belongs to.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.180
At this point,

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.310
you'd better confess the truth.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.510
Fine.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:46.850
I'll tell you.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.860
This person is none other than

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.520
the most favored Yu...

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.270
Shameless villain.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.550
You don't deserve to taint my ears.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.630
Your Majesty,
why were you so eager to kill him?

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.560
Are you not going to investigate

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.000
whether this sachet
was embroidered by Consort Yu,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
or whether they committed adultery

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:22.670
and engaged in illicit acts?

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:23.400
Impossible!

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:25.670
How could Empress Yu
be the person you describe?

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:26.840
How is it impossible?

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.770
These assassins
are servants from the Yu Residence!

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.330
Your Majesty,
are you really going to strike

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.590
your own brother for the sake of a woman?

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.510
Xiahou Bo,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.600
are you staging a rebellion?

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.880
Your Majesty,
you can ignore our brotherly ties,

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.180
but I must ask one question
for the sake of the realm.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.200
The Empress Dowager
was always in good health.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.290
Why did she suddenly pass away

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.340
after going to Mount Bei?

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:58.880
And Zhao Wucheng—

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.310
how did he escape unscathed

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.340
while under a city-wide manhunt?

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.770
Did he really have an affair
with Empress Yu?

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.390
Deposing the Crown Prince,
crowning the Empress,

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.840
killing loyal ministers,
favoring relatives by marriage—

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.640
Your Majesty,

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.280
have you been deceived
by the demonic empress

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.050
and lost your judgment?

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.000
Your Highness Prince Duan!

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.840
Shut up!

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.480
Can't you see the situation?

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.790
The verbal battle is over.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:24.710
Soldiers!

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:25.640
Here!

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.970
Eliminate the demonic empress

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.600
to purge His Majesty's side!

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.610
Yulin Guards!

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.390
Here!

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.800
Protect the Empress!

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.140
Uphold the truth!

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.080
Yes!

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.000
Kill!

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.200
Kill!

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.960
That scoundrel Xiahou Bo

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.360
has actually colluded
with the Central Army.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.620
Why was there no alarm?

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:54.670
It must have been when General Luo
of the Central Army

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:55.720
returned to court to report

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.150
that he left some men behind.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.840
Since then, they've been hiding nearby,

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.750
waiting for Prince Duan
to give the signal.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:01.320
Let's go!

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.160
Li, you...

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:20.880
Are you alright?

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.410
I'm fine.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.290
Good.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:23.369
Where's Er Lan?

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:24.510
I...

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:28.720
You...

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.710
You...

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:31.670
Li, where are you...

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.500
Where are you going?

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:37.230
Er Lan!

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:38.720
Er Lan!

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:40.440
Why are you going up there?

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.570
We're outnumbered.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.550
We must push the giant stone
down the mountain.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:43.950
Er Lan!

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:45.090
Er Lan!

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.880
Prince Duan's men already went up there.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.110
You'll only die if you go up.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:54.640
His Majesty and Her Majesty
cannot be left unprotected.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.880
Don't worry about me. Go back.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.370
Er Lan!

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:57.180
Er Lan!

00:17:58.550 --> 00:17:59.110
I'll go.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.350
I'll go, alright?

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:01.620
What are you talking about?

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.280
Li, don't you always
want to be a pillar in court?

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.700
You must live to that day.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.500
You're right.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.030
I joined the court
to make a name for myself.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.640
So don't try to steal that opportunity.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.130
At least I'm strong enough

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:13.570
to move that stone.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:14.920
Li!

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.180
I am a woman.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.040
My presence in court is already improper.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.840
Leaving is only a matter of time.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.360
Go back, Li.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.810
Great Xia needs you.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.230
Li?

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.370
How inappropriate.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:37.930
Hey!

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.200
Why are you standing here in a daze?

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.040
Er Lan is up there.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.500
Let's go save her quickly!

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.980
Catch that demon!

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.800
Wanyin!

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:06.590
Your Highness,

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:07.670
should we strike while the iron is hot

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:08.520
and just...

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:08.830
No.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.940
We'll hold her hostage

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.000
to force the Emperor to withdraw

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.600
and return to the palace to be confined.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.260
The Emperor cannot die today.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.030
Especially not here.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.180
He must be bewitched
by the demonic empress Yu Wanyin,

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.830
and then go mad and die in the palace.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:28.240
Who are you?

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:29.590
Go check

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.320
where Prince Duan's men are.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:34.950
Indeed.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.590
Down there are all Prince Duan's men.

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.550
Push the giant stone down the mountain!

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.080
Alright!

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:43.240
One!

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:44.100
Two!

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.070
Three!

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:48.240
An Xian.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.290
If anything happens to me,

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.610
protect yourself

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.280
and keep the palace secure.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.080
Your Majesty,

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:57.330
what are you saying?

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.700
I exercised with Her Majesty as well.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:16.840
You demon.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.980
I gave you a chance,

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.790
but you didn't take it.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.830
Who are you?

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.080
Mind your own business.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:01.310
Push harder!

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.210
Dan, come with me!

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:37.510
Mr. Bei, I can't leave yet.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.880
-I haven't make Great Xia...
-No!

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.680
We must go now!

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:40.350
Hurry!

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.000
We're giving up the throne!

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.330
Your Majesty, let's go!

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:47.880
Your Highness!

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.160
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.230
Hurry!

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.750
Lift it up!

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.080
Lift it up!

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:00.830
Lift it up!

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:02.500
My leg...

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:04.850
My leg!

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:06.130
Your Highness!

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.040
Your Highness!

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.240
Your Highness, how do you feel?

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.160
Go back to the city,

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.310
and get the imperial physician!

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:11.820
Where is Xiahou Dan?

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:12.510
Your Highness!

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:12.830
Your Highness!

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.030
That expert carried him away and escaped.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:14.690
After them!

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:15.500
Yes!

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.310
Yes, Your Highness!

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.440
I want him alive!

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:17.960
Yes!

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.280
From the looks of it,

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.640
the outcome is already decided.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.720
Where is His Majesty?

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.720
Why isn't he here?

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.280
Hurry!

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.750
-Hurry!
-Let's go!

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.040
Hurry!

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.590
Prince Duan planned such a grand scheme

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:36.030
just to usurp the throne.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.000
Now that Prince Duan is returning
to the capital unharmed,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.310
could it be that something happened
to His Majesty?

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.180
If His Majesty had died,

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.270
Prince Duan
wouldn't have left in such haste.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.310
And if Prince Duan had won,

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:46.710
it wouldn't have ended so abruptly,

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.110
leaving this mess behind.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.550
Look.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.010
Even the Empress Dowager's coffin
was left unattended.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:05.350
You're awake?

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.790
Get up.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.720
Why am I here?

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.260
You tell me.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:22.920
Xiahou Dan!

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:25.050
Stop the carriage.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.040
Stop right now.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.510
I was ordered

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:33.350
to escort you out of the capital
at the risk of my life.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.680
No matter what happens,

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.080
I cannot leave your side.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.400
I'm telling you
to stop the carriage immediately!

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.800
Don't waste your energy.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.800
They won't listen to you.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:43.830
I must say,

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:45.930
Xiao Tiancai is quite something.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.720
That sleeping drug
kept you unconscious for 2 full hours.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.750
You knew about this?

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:50.890
I didn't.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.200
I absolutely didn't.

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:54.370
I was going to leave this morning,

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.680
but Xiahou Dan secretly put you in here.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:58.310
He kept it from you

00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:59.650
until the last moment,

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.650
probably to prevent anyone
from leaking the secret.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.400
Alright.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.170
Stop being so angry.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:07.730
He did it for your own good.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.400
How's everything going at Mount Bei?

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.130
I don't know.

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.020
I plan to

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.920
find a place to settle down first,

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.030
then send someone to gather information.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:17.760
Is that okay?

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.680
Just enjoy the view outside the window.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.190
I'm finally free.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.060
Protect Her Highness!

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:33.060
It's a tripwire!

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:42.480
Are you alright?

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.270
I'm fine.

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:44.750
-Are you hurt anywhere?
-What about you?

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:45.280
I'm fine.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.640
Your Majesty,

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.810
would you kindly crawl out yourself?

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.290
Prince Duan

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.720
ordered me

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.240
to escort Empress Yu
to return to the palace.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:57.920
It's Mu Yun.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.180
It's best if you're alive,

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.800
but it's fine if you're dead.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:04.960
Empress Yu,

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.750
you'd better

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.950
-climb out obediently.
-There's a gun.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.550
Don't make me set the carriage on fire.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:17.840
If your face gets burned
beyond recognition,

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.350
-It'll be hard for me...
-Don't panic.

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:20.350
Pull it out first.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.120
To explain to Prince Duan.

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.440
Yong'er!

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.300
I'll stall him!

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.590
Mr. Mu,

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.040
you've got the wrong person.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:33.920
It's me.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:35.880
Mr. Mu,

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:36.950
why did you...

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:39.390
You've got the wrong person.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.400
Isn't this Consort Xie?

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:43.720
Mr. Mu,

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.170
you said Prince Duan sent you here.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.230
I don't believe it.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.960
You were dismissed from your position
long ago.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.270
You didn't even have the right

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.110
to attend the Empress Dowager's funeral.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.890
I guess

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.270
you're just looking for a chance
to redeem yourself

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:58.870
and get back in favor, right?

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:01.400
But after serving Prince Duan for so long,

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.860
you must know
what kind of person he truly is.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.160
He appears benevolent,

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.250
but is actually narrow-minded.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.060
Look at me.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.400
I'm a living example.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:12.830
Mr. Mu,

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.680
take my advice.

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.630
Prince Duan is no good ruler.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.720
His Majesty is kind-hearted.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.640
If you join me
in turning against Prince Duan,

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.370
he will surely spare your life.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:25.480
His Majesty?

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:31.200
He...

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:34.000
He can barely save himself now.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:35.710
At this point,

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.450
he might already be a corpse.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.180
You guessed right.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.150
My waiting here

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:47.030
is indeed my last desperate move.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.600
I was taking a gamble

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.050
that His Majesty
would send Empress Yu away.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.830
I was also betting

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.760
that they'd choose a secluded path.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.880
I pride myself on reading people.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.310
I should have been the one
skillfully balancing all sides,

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:05.000
all the factions

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.220
desperately trying to win me over.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.000
But now,

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.330
I have to be

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.650
a strategist without a position.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:15.400
Tell me,

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:16.880
who is to blame

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:18.920
for all of this?

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.490
Mr. Mu,

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.770
you should know very well

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.110
that there's no such thing
as balancing all sides.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.070
If there were,

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.270
you'd only end up
being scorned by all sides.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.290
What a sharp tongue.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.550
If it weren't for a traitor like you,

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.030
how would I, Murong Yunji,

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.490
have come to this?

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.080
With your petty tricks,

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.110
you actually think you can save

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:45.710
the person in that carriage?

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.240
I'm not like His Highness.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.550
I won't be seduced by your beauty.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.830
Rest assured.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.360
None of you...

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.440
will escape.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.790
Did I scare you?

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:21.320
Yong'er!

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:23.280
Yong'er!

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:29.350
Help!

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:31.000
Physician Xiao!

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.330
Where is Xiao Tiancai?

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.970
Did you forget?

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.430
He said...

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.860
he would stay in the palace...

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.770
in exchange for my freedom.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:40.960
Let's go back.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:42.640
