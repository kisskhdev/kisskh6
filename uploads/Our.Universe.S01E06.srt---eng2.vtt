00:14:35.943 --> 00:14:38.654
wouldn't old feelings come back?

00:14:38.654 --> 00:14:41.014
That senior was your first love, right?

00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:43.951
Yeah, he was.

00:14:43.951 --> 00:14:45.852
And judging by how he treats you,

00:14:45.852 --> 00:14:48.856
he clearly still cares about you.

00:14:50.188 --> 00:14:51.959
Honestly, I can't tell.

00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:53.294
He's always been kind

00:14:53.294 --> 00:14:55.296
and considerate with everyone.

00:14:55.296 --> 00:14:56.839
Oh, come on.

00:14:56.839 --> 00:14:59.474
I bet it's just you he treats that way.

00:15:00.553 --> 00:15:02.637
And what about your in-law?

00:15:02.637 --> 00:15:04.138
Has he ever made you feel

00:15:04.138 --> 00:15:07.516
something different?

00:15:07.516 --> 00:15:09.443
Something different?

00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:12.721
I mean, if you put it that way...

00:15:14.637 --> 00:15:16.283
Hyun Jin...

00:15:17.676 --> 00:15:19.886
There have been moments, yeah.

00:15:19.886 --> 00:15:22.406
He appears when I least expect it

00:15:22.406 --> 00:15:24.975
and catches me off guard,

00:15:24.975 --> 00:15:28.062
and I find myself depending on him.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.631
Plus,

00:15:33.668 --> 00:15:37.345
he had his guard up at first, so I missed it,

00:15:38.411 --> 00:15:40.341
but deep down, he cares more than most

00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:42.642
and he's been through a lot.

00:15:44.411 --> 00:15:47.373
Once I saw that, it all made sense.

00:15:48.123 --> 00:15:49.458
I realized

00:15:49.458 --> 00:15:52.003
he's been lonely this whole time.

00:15:53.229 --> 00:15:54.504
And it hit me that

00:15:54.504 --> 00:15:57.258
we might be pretty similar.

00:15:59.218 --> 00:16:01.070
If you're thinking about him that much,

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.435
then just say yes.

00:16:02.435 --> 00:16:03.388
What's holding you back?

00:16:03.388 --> 00:16:04.765
There is a problem.

00:16:04.765 --> 00:16:07.267
I've never once seen him that way.

00:16:07.267 --> 00:16:10.579
Then try looking at him differently.

00:16:10.579 --> 00:16:12.456
Seriously, you share a place

00:16:12.456 --> 00:16:13.541
with a man who has feelings for you,

00:16:13.541 --> 00:16:15.079
and you don't feel a single thing?

00:16:15.079 --> 00:16:17.302
How is that even possible?

00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:21.323
Unless your heart's already with your senior.

00:16:21.323 --> 00:16:23.159
My heart?

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.000
All I have room for right now is...

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.502
Woo Joo and landing a full-time job.

00:16:33.502 --> 00:16:35.921
Those two things, that's it.

00:16:35.921 --> 00:16:36.939
You know that

00:16:36.939 --> 00:16:39.567
I can't afford to think
about anything else right now.

00:16:39.567 --> 00:16:40.592
I don't know about that.

00:16:40.592 --> 00:16:44.097
I think time will tell.

00:16:50.519 --> 00:16:53.581
[Woo Joo's all bathed and changed,
and his first day of daycare is a wrap.]

00:16:53.581 --> 00:16:56.091
She read it and didn't even reply?

00:16:58.568 --> 00:17:00.738
Let's just focus on work.

00:17:02.618 --> 00:17:04.224
Shall we head in?

00:17:05.742 --> 00:17:07.178
[Food Supply Overview]
We have direct deals

00:17:07.178 --> 00:17:08.620
with quality-verified suppliers

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.765
along with several
alternative sources in place.

00:17:10.765 --> 00:17:12.224
That's great.

00:17:12.224 --> 00:17:15.561
GloMarket took interest in the K-food brand

00:17:15.561 --> 00:17:17.087
that's been developed with care over the years,

00:17:17.087 --> 00:17:19.102
which means we absolutely must secure

00:17:19.102 --> 00:17:20.483
top-tier raw materials.

00:17:20.483 --> 00:17:22.631
Of course, we'll make it happen.

00:17:22.631 --> 00:17:26.155
Let's call it a day on this meeting, then?

00:17:26.155 --> 00:17:28.039
Thank you all.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:37.215
The roads will be packed at this hour.

00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.168
Tell me about it.

00:17:39.168 --> 00:17:40.336
So I was thinking...

00:17:40.336 --> 00:17:42.345
What if we sneak off for a bit?

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.971
Can we order?

00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:52.539
Sure, go right ahead.

00:17:52.539 --> 00:17:55.125
One Strawberry Love Latte, extra whip,

00:17:55.125 --> 00:17:56.977
five rounds of java chips blended on top,

00:17:56.977 --> 00:17:58.437
with tons of chocolate drizzle,

00:17:58.437 --> 00:18:00.782
and finish it off with banana pudding.

00:18:00.782 --> 00:18:01.816
I'm sorry?

00:18:01.816 --> 00:18:03.575
Banana pudding.

00:18:06.303 --> 00:18:07.913
What is this?

00:18:07.913 --> 00:18:08.930
What else could it be?

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:11.392
It's your signature order.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.370
I can't believe you still know that.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.396
How could I forget?

00:18:16.396 --> 00:18:18.415
They only have this latte during the season.

00:18:18.415 --> 00:18:19.708
So each year when it comes back,

00:18:19.708 --> 00:18:22.294
I'd walk by and you'd cross my mind.

00:18:22.294 --> 00:18:24.571
Whenever I'd see someone with one,

00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:27.086
I'd wonder if you'd had yours yet.

00:18:27.086 --> 00:18:30.035
And when it disappeared from the menu,

00:18:30.035 --> 00:18:31.954
I'd feel this little pang of sadness.

00:18:32.579 --> 00:18:35.541
That's why everyone falls for you.

00:18:36.372 --> 00:18:40.866
I haven't had a single girlfriend
since college.

00:18:40.866 --> 00:18:41.922
Come on.

00:18:41.922 --> 00:18:44.030
What? I mean it.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:44.999
Why is that so hard to believe?

00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:48.678
It's just, you've always been well-liked,

00:18:48.678 --> 00:18:52.015
clearly brilliant, capable, kind,

00:18:52.015 --> 00:18:54.852
and on top of it all, tall and handso...

00:18:56.745 --> 00:18:58.813
Go on?

00:18:58.813 --> 00:19:01.067
Why'd you trail off?

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.502
Because you keep messing with me,

00:19:03.502 --> 00:19:06.748
I say things I don't mean to.

00:19:09.508 --> 00:19:11.088
By the way.

00:19:11.088 --> 00:19:13.220
How's the little one?

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.287
He's good.

00:19:14.287 --> 00:19:16.469
He went to daycare for the first time today.

00:19:16.469 --> 00:19:17.499
He's all grown up, right?

00:19:17.499 --> 00:19:20.543
He really is.

00:19:20.543 --> 00:19:23.046
Now that must be a relief.

00:19:23.046 --> 00:19:24.690
It really is.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.901
I was stressing about managing

00:19:26.901 --> 00:19:29.431
without my in-law around.

00:19:29.431 --> 00:19:33.329
You're not living with your in-law anymore?

00:19:33.329 --> 00:19:37.544
We only planned on staying together
for a month to begin with.

00:19:39.496 --> 00:19:41.255
I'm glad to hear that.

00:19:42.332 --> 00:19:43.399
What do you mean?

00:19:43.399 --> 00:19:45.994
Honestly, it made me a little uneasy,

00:19:46.628 --> 00:19:49.347
knowing you were staying with a man.

00:20:00.976 --> 00:20:03.211
Here's the thing about Amy Choo.

00:20:03.211 --> 00:20:07.323
She hates being disturbed
when inspiration strikes.

00:20:08.066 --> 00:20:10.485
So if she doesn't respond,

00:20:10.485 --> 00:20:13.906
it means something big is forming in her head,

00:20:13.906 --> 00:20:15.873
so give her space.

00:20:17.201 --> 00:20:18.433
As for storyboarding,

00:20:18.433 --> 00:20:20.579
she does it all by hand first.

00:20:20.579 --> 00:20:22.122
Typing it all up afterward,

00:20:22.122 --> 00:20:24.441
that falls on you.

00:20:24.441 --> 00:20:26.675
When creative differences come up,

00:20:26.675 --> 00:20:28.629
she leads with profanity,

00:20:28.629 --> 00:20:31.764
and you'll be the one who has to manage that.

00:20:32.615 --> 00:20:35.289
Sets, talent, styling,

00:20:35.289 --> 00:20:37.137
without needing step-by-step instructions,

00:20:37.137 --> 00:20:39.372
you figure it all out yourself,

00:20:39.372 --> 00:20:42.996
clean and with sharp instincts.

00:20:42.996 --> 00:20:44.002
Most importantly,

00:20:44.002 --> 00:20:47.022
she's very particular about what she eats,

00:20:47.022 --> 00:20:50.359
so it all has to be organic.

00:20:50.359 --> 00:20:52.319
Half an hour after each meal,

00:20:52.319 --> 00:20:58.166
hand her vitamins A, B, C, D, E

00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:01.620
on a rotating schedule,

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.205
and supplement the rest with fruit...

00:21:03.205 --> 00:21:04.915
Hold on,

00:21:04.915 --> 00:21:08.468
wasn't I hired to be an assistant?

00:21:09.743 --> 00:21:10.754
That's correct.

00:21:10.754 --> 00:21:12.172
And I'm expected to do all that?

00:21:12.172 --> 00:21:13.006
By myself?

00:21:13.006 --> 00:21:15.391
Is that too much for you?

00:21:16.093 --> 00:21:17.994
I can handle it, absolutely.

00:21:17.994 --> 00:21:19.763
Whatever needs to be done, I'll do it.

00:21:19.763 --> 00:21:20.681
That's what I like to hear.

00:21:20.681 --> 00:21:23.189
This is Amy Choo's team we're talking about.

00:21:23.189 --> 00:21:24.214
Just so you know,

00:21:24.214 --> 00:21:25.769
if your plan is to slack off for a while

00:21:25.769 --> 00:21:27.896
and use Amy Choo's reputation

00:21:27.896 --> 00:21:29.314
as a stepping stone for yourself...

00:21:29.314 --> 00:21:30.983
I wouldn't have taken the job.

00:21:30.983 --> 00:21:33.659
For me, this role is

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.241
my final chance too.

00:21:39.241 --> 00:21:41.417
Then we're on the same page.

00:21:41.417 --> 00:21:42.435
Oh, one more thing.

00:21:42.435 --> 00:21:44.020
Did you get through

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.706
that proposal Amy Choo asked you to check?

00:21:45.706 --> 00:21:47.102
I'm working through it now,

00:21:47.102 --> 00:21:48.166
but the visual references still

00:21:48.166 --> 00:21:51.211
need some more cross-referencing,

00:21:51.211 --> 00:21:53.655
so I'll wrap it up and report back
by end of day.

00:21:53.655 --> 00:21:55.700
I love

00:21:56.878 --> 00:21:58.768
that attitude.

00:22:00.262 --> 00:22:02.980
She needs her coffee right about now.

00:22:04.016 --> 00:22:05.976
I have to go.

00:22:05.976 --> 00:22:07.985
I'm late.

00:22:10.605 --> 00:22:14.200
He's so devoted to her.

00:22:16.194 --> 00:22:18.037
There's so much on my plate.

00:22:26.121 --> 00:22:27.964
One, two.

00:22:30.709 --> 00:22:32.336
Give me something bashful, bashful.

00:22:32.336 --> 00:22:34.095
There it is, bashful.

00:22:36.214 --> 00:22:39.016
Now the look on your face, light and airy.

00:22:43.722 --> 00:22:45.724
Hang on a second.

00:22:45.724 --> 00:22:48.317
He told me he'd only worked as an assistant.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.672
These shots are actually impressive.

00:22:58.987 --> 00:23:00.955
You finished it all.

00:23:03.766 --> 00:23:04.910
[My Daily Life]

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:08.497
I thought maybe I sent him too soon,

00:23:08.497 --> 00:23:11.424
but he did great on his own.

00:23:12.632 --> 00:23:15.420
I feel like I've barely done anything,

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.805
yet here he is, growing up so fast.

00:23:19.299 --> 00:23:20.717
Woo Joo.

00:23:20.717 --> 00:23:22.118
Was daycare fun today?

00:23:23.282 --> 00:23:26.932
Think you can do it again tomorrow?

00:23:29.601 --> 00:23:30.936
Where are you going?

00:23:30.936 --> 00:23:32.695
Woo Joo, where are you going?

00:23:36.775 --> 00:23:38.360
You're back?

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.320
Yeah, I'm back.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.780
Woo Joo's here too?

00:23:42.989 --> 00:23:45.412
I grabbed him on my way back from work.

00:23:45.412 --> 00:23:46.910
I see.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:47.994
Did you eat yet?

00:23:47.994 --> 00:23:49.712
Yeah, I ate.

00:23:50.622 --> 00:23:52.332
Oh, great. Good.

00:23:52.332 --> 00:23:54.376
- Let me start the laund...
- It's already done.

00:23:54.376 --> 00:23:56.128
Don't worry about it.

00:23:56.128 --> 00:23:58.004
Oh, really?

00:23:58.004 --> 00:23:59.047
I bet we were low on detergent...

00:23:59.047 --> 00:24:01.891
So I grabbed some on the way back.

00:24:07.931 --> 00:24:10.225
Honestly,

00:24:10.225 --> 00:24:11.268
how do I put this,

00:24:11.268 --> 00:24:12.853
you're amazing, truly amazing.

00:24:14.003 --> 00:24:15.840
Thank you.

00:24:16.565 --> 00:24:17.899
Really, thank you.

00:24:17.899 --> 00:24:19.669
Woo Joo, Auntie's the best, right?

00:24:22.696 --> 00:24:24.072
Let me just hit the bathroom.

00:24:24.072 --> 00:24:25.449
Yeah, have a good...

00:24:25.449 --> 00:24:27.291
Take care.

00:24:33.206 --> 00:24:36.008
Did I just say "have a good trip"?

00:24:42.674 --> 00:24:45.302
I really

00:24:45.302 --> 00:24:47.679
need to fix this.

00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:49.313
Woo Joo, bye.

00:24:50.474 --> 00:24:52.400
Let me just hit the bathroom.

00:25:04.529 --> 00:25:05.530
Hello?

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:06.865
Hello.

00:25:06.865 --> 00:25:08.582
Oh, right.

00:25:10.619 --> 00:25:12.211
Yes.

00:25:12.954 --> 00:25:14.289
Yes.

00:25:14.289 --> 00:25:17.209
What's with all the "yes, yes"?

00:25:17.209 --> 00:25:18.293
Excuse me.

00:25:18.293 --> 00:25:20.837
The repairs at your apartment are finished.

00:25:20.837 --> 00:25:22.214
Everything's been fixed up,

00:25:22.214 --> 00:25:24.466
so come take a look, and if it checks out,

00:25:24.466 --> 00:25:26.551
you can move back in immediately.

00:25:26.551 --> 00:25:27.552
By the way,

00:25:27.552 --> 00:25:30.597
how did you get it done so quickly?

00:25:30.597 --> 00:25:32.265
Is it even done properly?

00:25:32.265 --> 00:25:33.391
You were the one

00:25:33.391 --> 00:25:35.185
who kept asking me to hurry up, remember?

00:25:35.185 --> 00:25:37.354
Plus, it's almost been a month already,

00:25:37.354 --> 00:25:38.980
so I'm not sure what the issue is.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.782
Alright, I'll stop by and see it tomorrow.

00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:51.826
[The Day I Go Home]

00:25:51.826 --> 00:25:54.645
Has it really been a whole month already?

00:25:54.645 --> 00:25:57.157
Where did all the time go?

00:26:05.506 --> 00:26:09.164
I'm fine doing this on my own.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.212
I was serious.

00:26:18.586 --> 00:26:21.131
What I told you,

00:26:21.131 --> 00:26:23.678
all of it was real.

00:26:25.756 --> 00:26:27.967
However,

00:26:27.967 --> 00:26:29.135
I won't

00:26:29.135 --> 00:26:31.395
expect anything from you.

00:26:32.555 --> 00:26:35.349
I just wanted you to know where I stand.

00:26:35.349 --> 00:26:38.394
I'm not trying to push for something,

00:26:38.394 --> 00:26:40.479
and I would never

00:26:40.479 --> 00:26:42.276
make this hard for you.

00:26:42.276 --> 00:26:44.320
I honestly figured

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.406
you were rambling because of the medication

00:26:46.406 --> 00:26:48.826
and being barely awake.

00:26:50.031 --> 00:26:53.476
Pretending I don't feel anything

00:26:53.476 --> 00:26:54.827
and just letting it slide,

00:26:54.827 --> 00:26:56.867
that's not something I can do.

00:26:56.867 --> 00:26:59.256
I'm sure it showed right away.

00:27:00.416 --> 00:27:02.426
So,

00:27:03.127 --> 00:27:05.671
let's just keep things

00:27:05.671 --> 00:27:08.007
the way they were.

00:27:08.007 --> 00:27:09.508
See?

00:27:09.508 --> 00:27:10.843
Woo Joo already knows

00:27:10.843 --> 00:27:12.477
the vibe is different.

00:27:13.679 --> 00:27:15.518
You're right.

00:27:15.518 --> 00:27:17.939
Woo Joo picks up on everything.

00:27:21.145 --> 00:27:23.530
Hold on, what is that?

00:27:25.132 --> 00:27:26.992
My bag.

00:27:29.984 --> 00:27:32.038
I don't like you.

00:28:03.145 --> 00:28:04.605
What's wrong?

00:28:04.605 --> 00:28:07.024
Mommy.

00:28:07.024 --> 00:28:08.025
Mommy.

00:28:08.025 --> 00:28:09.568
- Woo Joo.
- What's wrong?

00:28:09.568 --> 00:28:12.029
- Come to me.
- Mommy.

00:28:12.029 --> 00:28:13.698
Mommy.

00:28:13.698 --> 00:28:15.616
It's okay.

00:28:15.616 --> 00:28:17.459
Mommy.

00:28:20.166 --> 00:28:21.627
I'm late.

00:28:21.627 --> 00:28:23.355
My bag.

00:28:24.375 --> 00:28:25.751
Where's my wallet?

00:28:25.751 --> 00:28:27.461
It's on top of the toy shelf.

00:28:27.461 --> 00:28:29.095
Thanks.

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:34.552
ID card, phone.

00:28:34.552 --> 00:28:36.144
Right here.

00:28:37.365 --> 00:28:38.392
I'm going to be late.

00:28:38.392 --> 00:28:39.810
I need to run, I'll see you later.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:41.738
Woo Joo, bye.

00:28:43.227 --> 00:28:44.945
See you later.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.830
What are the cops doing here?

00:28:59.455 --> 00:29:01.036
Say hello to your teacher. Bow nicely.

00:29:01.036 --> 00:29:02.913
Hello, Woo Joo. Bow for me.

00:29:02.913 --> 00:29:04.290
Hello.

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:05.082
See you later.

00:29:05.082 --> 00:29:06.083
Say bye.

00:29:06.083 --> 00:29:06.792
Bye.

00:29:06.792 --> 00:29:08.043
Say bye.

00:29:08.043 --> 00:29:09.970
Let's go.

00:29:15.721 --> 00:29:17.636
It's not safe to go home after dark.

00:29:17.636 --> 00:29:19.138
- I'm so scared.
- You've had a rough time.

00:29:19.138 --> 00:29:20.097
Leave it to me.

00:29:20.097 --> 00:29:22.385
I'll take care of it.

00:29:22.385 --> 00:29:24.643
Now where do I track down this sicko?

00:29:24.643 --> 00:29:26.479
The world's really gone crazy these days.

00:29:26.479 --> 00:29:28.355
I need to grab him and set him straight,

00:29:28.355 --> 00:29:29.440
right?

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.150
Just leave it to me, okay?

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.360
What's going on?

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.322
Don't you know what goes on around here?

00:29:36.322 --> 00:29:37.823
A whole building in this area

00:29:37.823 --> 00:29:39.450
was cleaned out last night.

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:40.826
And he specifically went after places

00:29:40.826 --> 00:29:41.994
where women live by themselves.

00:29:41.994 --> 00:29:43.704
Who in their right mind does that?

00:29:43.704 --> 00:29:45.456
The whole thing was planned out,

00:29:45.456 --> 00:29:46.999
and he dodged every camera in the area,

00:29:46.999 --> 00:29:47.875
so he's still on the loose.

00:29:47.875 --> 00:29:49.877
The word around here is

00:29:49.877 --> 00:29:51.378
some shady man wearing a cap

00:29:51.378 --> 00:29:53.930
has been spotted wandering around at night.

00:29:55.591 --> 00:29:57.183
A cap.

00:30:00.474 --> 00:30:02.765
Oh, come on.

00:30:02.765 --> 00:30:04.099
Make sure you tell

00:30:04.099 --> 00:30:05.851
your in-law to watch out at night.

00:30:05.851 --> 00:30:08.069
Until I get my hands on this guy.

00:30:09.396 --> 00:30:12.282
She's always out late, so that worries me.

00:30:13.072 --> 00:30:14.905
Did you notice the cops earlier?

00:30:14.905 --> 00:30:17.863
There was a break-in at our villa yesterday.

00:30:17.863 --> 00:30:19.031
Listen.

00:30:19.031 --> 00:30:21.283
Our villa got robbed yesterday.

00:30:21.283 --> 00:30:22.535
And the guy's still out there.

00:30:22.535 --> 00:30:23.953
Wait, a break-in?

00:30:23.953 --> 00:30:25.412
He targets women who live alone

00:30:25.412 --> 00:30:27.331
and stalks them after dark.

00:30:27.331 --> 00:30:29.291
That's absolutely insane.

00:30:29.291 --> 00:30:30.668
What is wrong with people lately?

00:30:30.668 --> 00:30:32.469
Seriously.

00:30:33.072 --> 00:30:35.467
Just get home early for the time being.

00:30:35.467 --> 00:30:37.562
Can you leave on time today?

00:30:38.592 --> 00:30:40.135
Hey.

00:30:40.135 --> 00:30:41.679
Who are you messaging right now?

00:30:41.679 --> 00:30:43.889
It's your in-law, isn't it?

00:30:43.889 --> 00:30:45.891
Tell me.

00:30:45.891 --> 00:30:48.356
Something happened again, didn't it?

00:30:48.356 --> 00:30:49.399
Seriously. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:30:49.399 --> 00:30:53.190
You're hooked on drama, you know that?

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:54.525
Focus on your lunch.

00:30:54.525 --> 00:30:55.818
Honestly, nothing at all?

00:30:55.818 --> 00:30:57.577
Nope.

00:31:01.907 --> 00:31:05.794
This wallpaper looks like it's coming off.

00:31:07.085 --> 00:31:10.082
You requested spaced-out installation.

00:31:10.082 --> 00:31:12.334
These tiles don't look quite right.

00:31:12.334 --> 00:31:15.254
Does all of this need to come out again?

00:31:15.254 --> 00:31:17.047
That's just the pattern. The pattern.

00:31:17.047 --> 00:31:18.765
Right, the pattern.

00:31:20.885 --> 00:31:22.720
The wiring is safe to use now, right?

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.513
Is the moisture from the pipe that burst

00:31:24.513 --> 00:31:26.599
all dried up now?

00:31:26.599 --> 00:31:28.187
I'm losing my patience here, really.

00:31:28.187 --> 00:31:30.936
If something needs to be fixed again,

00:31:30.936 --> 00:31:32.438
just let me know.

00:31:32.438 --> 00:31:33.564
Alright, fine.

00:31:33.564 --> 00:31:35.566
The tiles can be replaced,

00:31:35.566 --> 00:31:37.067
but there's an additional charge.

00:31:37.067 --> 00:31:38.611
Maybe you should've decided from the start.

00:31:38.611 --> 00:31:40.244
Why do you keep changing your mind?

00:31:40.244 --> 00:31:42.221
Want us to redo them or not?

00:31:43.077 --> 00:31:44.783
Things have been uneasy at the villa too,

00:31:44.783 --> 00:31:47.494
so now isn't ideal for moving back.

00:31:47.494 --> 00:31:48.621
Well, okay then.

00:31:48.621 --> 00:31:50.831
Decide what you want and call me.

00:31:50.831 --> 00:31:52.424
Come on, let's head out.

00:32:01.679 --> 00:32:04.524
Did this place always feel this bare?

00:32:27.785 --> 00:32:28.900
Hello?

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:29.957
Where are you?

00:32:29.957 --> 00:32:31.314
Shouldn't you be off the bus by now?

00:32:31.314 --> 00:32:33.707
I dozed off without meaning to.

00:32:33.707 --> 00:32:36.085
This is why you shouldn't
just fall asleep anywhere.

00:32:36.085 --> 00:32:37.503
Wait...

00:32:37.503 --> 00:32:39.713
You weren't waiting for me, right?

00:32:39.713 --> 00:32:42.591
No, it's not like that.

00:32:42.591 --> 00:32:44.426
Bom's mom took Woo Joo along

00:32:44.426 --> 00:32:46.098
and said she'd feed his dinner.

00:32:46.098 --> 00:32:47.429
I just didn't want you to make a wasted trip.

00:32:47.429 --> 00:32:50.140
Yeah, she let me know as well.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.104
Where exactly are you?

00:32:52.104 --> 00:32:53.644
Just say where and I'll pick you up.

00:32:53.644 --> 00:32:54.523
Come on.

00:32:54.523 --> 00:32:56.647
I can take care of myself.

00:32:56.647 --> 00:32:58.490
Let's just meet back at the house.

00:33:12.029 --> 00:33:14.081
There was a break-in at our villa.

00:33:14.081 --> 00:33:17.126
He goes after women living alone

00:33:17.126 --> 00:33:19.344
and tails them after dark.

00:33:45.863 --> 00:33:47.489
Just as I thought. The next stop means

00:33:47.489 --> 00:33:49.290
you'd be coming this way...

00:33:53.203 --> 00:33:55.039
What's wrong?

00:33:55.039 --> 00:33:56.832
What is it? Talk to me.

00:33:56.832 --> 00:33:58.504
What?

00:33:58.504 --> 00:34:00.800
Go ahead, I'm listening.

00:34:03.422 --> 00:34:05.056
I'm just...

00:34:07.676 --> 00:34:09.686
I feel safe now.

00:34:16.977 --> 00:34:18.312
If this ever happens again,

00:34:18.312 --> 00:34:20.189
reach out to me.

00:34:20.189 --> 00:34:22.156
Don't go through it by yourself.

00:34:23.859 --> 00:34:25.410
Swear

00:34:26.653 --> 00:34:28.872
you'll contact me.

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.793
I'm saying this
because I really worry about you.

00:34:37.209 --> 00:34:38.240
Alright.

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.216
Next time, I'll definitely reach out.

00:34:48.892 --> 00:34:52.054
So about the work on my apartment,

00:34:52.054 --> 00:34:53.514
the contractor called me.

00:34:53.514 --> 00:34:55.398
He says everything's finished.

00:34:56.854 --> 00:34:59.186
Oh, is that right?

00:34:59.186 --> 00:35:00.371
That fast?

00:35:02.689 --> 00:35:05.806
So I stopped by to look it over today,

00:35:05.806 --> 00:35:08.028
and the wallpaper was lifting off,

00:35:08.028 --> 00:35:09.828
the tiles were all uneven,

00:35:09.828 --> 00:35:11.907
and it was still damp inside.

00:35:11.907 --> 00:35:14.034
What even caused that pipe to burst?

00:35:14.034 --> 00:35:16.495
That's what I'm saying.

00:35:16.495 --> 00:35:19.414
It's a mystery, honestly.

00:35:19.414 --> 00:35:22.084
Anyway, so...

00:35:22.084 --> 00:35:25.678
Looks like I'll be here a while longer.

00:35:27.422 --> 00:35:28.677
Yeah, of course.

00:35:28.677 --> 00:35:31.677
Better not to move in too quickly
and end up regretting it.

00:35:31.677 --> 00:35:33.353
Exactly.

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:43.446
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:35:46.525 --> 00:35:48.402
What is this?

00:35:48.402 --> 00:35:49.740
It's pepper spray for safety.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.114
I spotted it while I was out.

00:35:52.114 --> 00:35:53.584
Until they find the suspect,

00:35:53.584 --> 00:35:55.249
keep this on you.

00:35:57.223 --> 00:35:58.954
Honestly, the more I get to know you,

00:35:58.954 --> 00:36:01.339
the more I see how caring you are.

00:36:02.366 --> 00:36:04.046
That's because you haven't seen enough.

00:36:04.046 --> 00:36:06.837
With the people I care about,

00:36:06.837 --> 00:36:09.263
I'm actually pretty warm.

00:36:11.341 --> 00:36:13.468
How does this thing work, though?

00:36:13.468 --> 00:36:15.554
Just flip the safety lock off

00:36:15.554 --> 00:36:17.188
and push down hard.

00:36:17.893 --> 00:36:19.603
Nothing's happening.

00:36:19.603 --> 00:36:21.441
Come on, let me try.

00:36:25.164 --> 00:36:26.273
Wait, what's wrong with it?

00:36:26.273 --> 00:36:28.233
See, I told you it doesn't work.

00:36:28.233 --> 00:36:29.909
This must be a dud, right?

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.741
Wait, what happened?

00:36:35.741 --> 00:36:37.075
It sprayed right in my eyes.

00:36:37.075 --> 00:36:38.076
It went in your eyes?

00:36:38.076 --> 00:36:39.161
Oh no, what now?

00:36:39.161 --> 00:36:40.370
Quick, call someone.

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:41.705
119.

00:36:41.705 --> 00:36:42.789
- 119.
- I really can't see.

00:36:42.789 --> 00:36:43.498
Got it.

00:36:43.498 --> 00:36:46.043
Which way am I facing right now?

00:36:46.043 --> 00:36:47.885
My eyes!

00:36:48.754 --> 00:36:49.883
Please.

00:36:49.883 --> 00:36:51.465
Stop moving for a moment.

00:36:51.465 --> 00:36:53.675
We have to flush it out with water.

00:36:53.675 --> 00:36:56.053
How did you manage to spray yourself?

00:36:56.053 --> 00:36:57.387
Oh wait.

00:36:57.387 --> 00:36:59.389
I think some got in my eye as well.

00:36:59.389 --> 00:37:00.394
My eyes are burning so bad.

00:37:00.394 --> 00:37:01.350
Come on.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:02.059
Take a seat.

00:37:02.059 --> 00:37:03.602
Seriously, everything is blurry.

00:37:03.602 --> 00:37:04.436
Okay, just relax.

00:37:04.436 --> 00:37:05.896
I literally cannot see right now.

00:37:05.896 --> 00:37:07.439
Hold on to me.

00:37:07.439 --> 00:37:10.199
Now, try to open your eyes.

00:37:31.008 --> 00:37:33.090
I don't see anything wrong.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:34.341
Is it still bothering you?

00:37:34.341 --> 00:37:37.431
When you open my eyes this wide,
of course it hurts.

00:37:37.431 --> 00:37:39.179
You're not doing this on purpose, are you?

00:37:39.179 --> 00:37:41.810
Oh please, why would I do that?

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:42.929
Just wait here.

00:37:42.929 --> 00:37:45.234
I'll look up whether there are side effects.

00:38:11.169 --> 00:38:13.088
Are you okay?

00:38:13.088 --> 00:38:15.348
Yeah, thanks.

00:38:24.436 --> 00:38:27.400
Then try seeing him as a man.

00:38:28.312 --> 00:38:30.113
Snap out of it.

00:38:34.026 --> 00:38:38.079
This spray is actually no joke.

00:38:42.381 --> 00:38:44.494
No, it works.

00:38:44.494 --> 00:38:45.746
Sure.

00:38:45.746 --> 00:38:48.235
Just let me know once you get here.

00:38:48.235 --> 00:38:49.291
What is it?

00:38:49.291 --> 00:38:50.412
What's going on?

00:38:50.412 --> 00:38:52.044
We've locked in the outside team

00:38:52.044 --> 00:38:54.279
for visual directing on the GloMarket project.

00:38:54.279 --> 00:38:55.756
It's official.

00:38:55.756 --> 00:38:57.090
Fortunately, we landed a deal

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:58.550
with the team we wanted most,

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.305
and we're meeting them today.

00:39:00.305 --> 00:39:02.021
Oh, that's wonderful.

00:39:02.021 --> 00:39:03.597
So who did we get?

00:39:03.597 --> 00:39:04.931
Well...

00:39:04.931 --> 00:39:08.060
I believe we secured the top name in Korea.

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.437
You can find out in person later.

00:39:10.437 --> 00:39:12.651
That top name in Korea is...

00:39:12.651 --> 00:39:14.358
- It's an honor.
- Nice to meet you.

00:39:14.358 --> 00:39:16.159
Amy Choo?

00:39:30.248 --> 00:39:31.966
Hello.

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:35.504
In-law?

00:39:35.504 --> 00:39:37.255
In-law?

00:39:37.255 --> 00:39:38.423
Wait, who?

00:39:38.423 --> 00:39:39.257
The two of them?

00:39:39.257 --> 00:39:40.144
Hang on a second.

00:39:40.144 --> 00:39:41.843
Where have I seen him before?

00:39:41.843 --> 00:39:43.720
There's no way he figured out

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:44.946
Tae Hyung's the guy from the lobby, right?

00:39:44.946 --> 00:39:46.598
Wait, hold on.

00:39:46.598 --> 00:39:48.477
Why do I feel like I know her?

00:39:48.477 --> 00:39:50.943
Oh, his wife?

00:39:52.274 --> 00:39:53.313
Wife?

00:39:53.313 --> 00:39:54.815
Who? The two of them?

00:39:54.815 --> 00:39:56.282
What?

00:39:57.234 --> 00:39:58.235
No, we're not.

00:39:58.235 --> 00:40:00.195
No?

00:40:00.195 --> 00:40:01.407
Alright then.

00:40:01.407 --> 00:40:03.998
Why don't we dive into the meeting?

00:40:09.643 --> 00:40:11.335
Like we outlined in the proposal,

00:40:11.335 --> 00:40:14.334
GloMarket has a strong interest in K-culture.

00:40:14.334 --> 00:40:15.919
Which is why

00:40:15.919 --> 00:40:17.838
your hanbok and hanok collections

00:40:17.838 --> 00:40:19.110
also stood out to them.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:21.216
It's been some time
since I did anything Korean,

00:40:21.216 --> 00:40:22.884
so this could be interesting.

00:40:22.884 --> 00:40:24.845
And I've never shot food before,

00:40:24.845 --> 00:40:26.225
so that adds to the appeal.

00:40:26.225 --> 00:40:28.894
I get the general direction you're aiming for,

00:40:28.894 --> 00:40:30.517
but the visual shifts so much

00:40:30.517 --> 00:40:32.436
depending on each product...

00:40:32.436 --> 00:40:35.856
We'll nail that down on our side soon
and send it your way.

00:40:35.856 --> 00:40:38.108
Was there anything else you wanted to...

00:40:38.108 --> 00:40:40.326
Oh, it's not really a question.

00:40:41.126 --> 00:40:43.663
I prepared something ahead of time.

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:45.327
What's this?

00:40:45.327 --> 00:40:47.190
Since the concept is still being decided,

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:48.869
I compiled some visual references

00:40:48.869 --> 00:40:49.623
that match the tone

00:40:49.623 --> 00:40:51.621
of the images used in the proposal.

00:40:51.621 --> 00:40:52.876
I thought

00:40:52.876 --> 00:40:54.553
it might come in handy.

00:40:54.553 --> 00:40:55.796
This is impressive.

00:40:55.796 --> 00:40:57.842
We'll definitely use this.

00:40:58.879 --> 00:41:01.089
You know what,

00:41:01.089 --> 00:41:02.094
since this is our first project together,

00:41:02.094 --> 00:41:04.342
why don't we do a group dinner?

00:41:04.342 --> 00:41:05.135
Gyu Jeong,

00:41:05.135 --> 00:41:07.762
now that's a solid suggestion for once.

00:41:07.762 --> 00:41:09.931
So we're all in, then?

00:41:09.931 --> 00:41:11.516
I'll have to pass.

00:41:11.516 --> 00:41:13.435
I honestly never understood people

00:41:13.435 --> 00:41:15.486
who like company dinners.

00:41:17.043 --> 00:41:20.275
Then let's just have whoever's interested
get a bite together.

00:41:20.275 --> 00:41:21.318
Sounds perfect.

00:41:21.318 --> 00:41:23.452
I'm a huge fan of team dinners.

00:41:30.952 --> 00:41:34.046
That face is definitely familiar.

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:40.386
Let's all get in.

00:41:56.353 --> 00:41:58.988
What are you looking at me for...

00:42:02.446 --> 00:42:04.281
Honey, how was your interview?

00:42:04.281 --> 00:42:07.453
Thanks to you,
everyone calls me the lobby girl.

00:42:08.892 --> 00:42:10.269
We're on the lobby level.

00:42:10.269 --> 00:42:11.330
Lobby.

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:12.331
The lobby guy!

00:42:12.331 --> 00:42:13.411
Lobby?

00:42:13.411 --> 00:42:15.330
Right? That nightmare lobby guy.

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:16.164
Lobby.

00:42:16.164 --> 00:42:18.959
- The one calling a woman "babe."
- Lobby guy!

00:42:18.959 --> 00:42:20.377
- The lobby guy.
- Lobby guy.

00:42:20.377 --> 00:42:22.462
Oh my, so then?

00:42:22.462 --> 00:42:24.388
She's that girl.

00:42:26.424 --> 00:42:27.425
It's definitely her.

00:42:27.425 --> 00:42:29.435
Let me out, please, open up.

00:42:33.143 --> 00:42:35.913
So the lobby girl
was actually you, Hyun Jin, all along.

00:42:35.913 --> 00:42:39.208
I had a feeling something was weird.

00:42:39.208 --> 00:42:41.710
Wait, are you two husband and wife?

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:43.295
We told you, we're not a couple.

00:42:43.295 --> 00:42:44.963
If that's the case,

00:42:44.963 --> 00:42:46.673
then what was all that drama about?

00:42:46.673 --> 00:42:49.951
So you're dating then?

00:42:49.951 --> 00:42:50.969
Absolutely not.

00:42:50.969 --> 00:42:53.722
That's not it at all.

00:42:53.722 --> 00:42:55.516
The two of us are

00:42:55.516 --> 00:42:57.768
just in-laws. That's it.

00:42:57.768 --> 00:42:59.186
- In-laws?
- What?

00:42:59.186 --> 00:43:02.289
Wait, you two are in-laws?

00:43:03.256 --> 00:43:05.651
So what about the child?

00:43:05.651 --> 00:43:08.845
Wasn't there a kid in that video?

00:43:08.845 --> 00:43:09.863
A nephew or something?

00:43:09.863 --> 00:43:11.073
But...

00:43:11.073 --> 00:43:13.242
In-laws don't usually call each other "babe."

00:43:13.242 --> 00:43:15.310
That's clearly a couple thing, right?

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:18.029
Or is it still undefined?

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:19.648
That's really not the situation...

00:43:19.648 --> 00:43:21.542
Alright, that's enough.

00:43:21.542 --> 00:43:24.586
We all have our own stories,
and the rest is private,

00:43:24.586 --> 00:43:26.004
so let's leave it alone.

00:43:26.004 --> 00:43:27.839
Why don't we raise our glasses instead?

00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:30.016
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:43:30.634 --> 00:43:32.393
Drink up.

00:43:47.693 --> 00:43:50.696
I'd been hoping to meet you,

00:43:50.696 --> 00:43:53.323
though not quite under these circumstances.

00:43:53.323 --> 00:43:55.367
You wanted to meet me?

00:43:55.367 --> 00:43:57.369
How come?

00:43:57.369 --> 00:43:59.121
Well...

00:43:59.121 --> 00:44:02.124
I wanted to ask you to keep an eye on her,

00:44:02.124 --> 00:44:05.586
since our Hyun Jin
is secretly a bit of a klutz.

00:44:05.586 --> 00:44:07.178
"Our"?

00:44:11.842 --> 00:44:13.684
Have some water too.

00:44:18.481 --> 00:44:19.833
Yes.

00:44:19.833 --> 00:44:23.729
Honestly, since when am I a klutz?

00:44:23.729 --> 00:44:24.813
Oh, come on.

00:44:24.813 --> 00:44:26.315
Think back to our college days.

00:44:26.315 --> 00:44:27.691
Back then, you would...

00:44:27.691 --> 00:44:31.445
That's so unfair, using old stories.

00:44:31.445 --> 00:44:33.363
Oh, by the way,

00:44:33.363 --> 00:44:35.407
neither of you had any idea?

00:44:35.407 --> 00:44:37.326
That you'd end up on the same project.

00:44:37.326 --> 00:44:38.327
No.

00:44:38.327 --> 00:44:41.086
I honestly didn't know at all.

00:44:41.086 --> 00:44:43.305
Did you know?

00:44:43.305 --> 00:44:44.357
What?

00:44:44.357 --> 00:44:46.209
Why did you keep it to yourself?

00:44:46.209 --> 00:44:47.919
Well, I guess,

00:44:47.919 --> 00:44:50.088
just because you share a place

00:44:50.088 --> 00:44:52.007
doesn't mean you share everything.

00:44:52.007 --> 00:44:53.759
We are close, actually.

00:44:53.759 --> 00:44:56.136
Ah, I see.

00:44:56.136 --> 00:44:58.138
You probably have no idea

00:44:58.138 --> 00:45:01.058
about her personal relationships

00:45:01.058 --> 00:45:03.985
given that you're only her supervisor.

00:45:04.853 --> 00:45:06.855
By the way...

00:45:06.855 --> 00:45:09.566
It's unbelievable how people
come up with these wild stories.

00:45:09.566 --> 00:45:11.742
"Lobby guy," seriously.

00:45:13.195 --> 00:45:14.988
You're not her boyfriend.

00:45:14.988 --> 00:45:16.789
You're her family member.

00:45:23.288 --> 00:45:25.123
Let's not just sit here like this.

00:45:25.123 --> 00:45:26.375
Let's toast, come on.

00:45:26.375 --> 00:45:28.168
Hold on.

00:45:28.168 --> 00:45:29.886
There's something on your lips.

00:45:36.093 --> 00:45:37.302
Did you spill?

00:45:37.302 --> 00:45:39.596
Watch what you're doing.

00:45:39.596 --> 00:45:42.015
You've been off since yesterday, what's up?

00:45:42.015 --> 00:45:44.358
Was I too intense yesterday?

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:49.439
Well...

00:45:49.439 --> 00:45:51.358
Did something go down yesterday?

00:45:51.358 --> 00:45:53.694
It's just, yesterday he had

00:45:53.694 --> 00:45:55.362
a thing with pepper spray.

00:45:55.362 --> 00:45:57.114
Pepper spray?

00:45:57.114 --> 00:45:58.615
Why, what happened?

00:45:58.615 --> 00:46:00.350
Was there another incident?

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:03.912
There was a burglary at the villa,
and yesterday was absolute madness.

00:46:03.912 --> 00:46:05.872
A burglary?

00:46:05.872 --> 00:46:07.548
You're alright, though?

00:46:08.441 --> 00:46:11.287
Yooseong Villa's security
must be really lacking.

00:46:11.287 --> 00:46:12.295
I'm alright. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:46:12.295 --> 00:46:13.797
Tae Hyung's there with me,

00:46:13.797 --> 00:46:14.965
so there's nothing to worry about.

00:46:14.965 --> 00:46:17.134
Don't worry. I'm home with her.

00:46:17.134 --> 00:46:20.554
She's not exactly like Suzy,
despite how she looks.

00:46:21.423 --> 00:46:23.356
Cut it out.

00:46:24.307 --> 00:46:26.877
Why are you nudging me

00:46:26.877 --> 00:46:29.966
with your foot under the table?

00:46:38.608 --> 00:46:39.948
Everything's just clicking today.

00:46:39.948 --> 00:46:41.908
Strike.

00:46:41.908 --> 00:46:43.493
I forgot how much fun this is.

00:46:43.493 --> 00:46:46.170
How about you two face off?

00:46:47.164 --> 00:46:49.340
Sun Tae Hyung.

00:47:07.225 --> 00:47:09.895
Your in-law is quite the catch, huh?

00:47:09.895 --> 00:47:12.105
I'm sorry?

00:47:12.105 --> 00:47:13.565
People like him that much?

00:47:13.565 --> 00:47:17.319
Regardless, they're both eye candy.

00:47:17.319 --> 00:47:19.613
Is he really that handsome?

00:47:19.613 --> 00:47:21.114
Which one's your type?

00:47:21.114 --> 00:47:22.407
Manager Park?

00:47:22.407 --> 00:47:24.618
Or your in-law?

00:47:24.618 --> 00:47:25.577
Manager, show us what you've got.

00:47:25.577 --> 00:47:27.461
Oh, our manager.

00:47:43.011 --> 00:47:44.221
Nice one, Tae Hyung.

00:47:44.221 --> 00:47:47.815
You're really good.

00:48:13.875 --> 00:48:15.794
So close.

00:48:15.794 --> 00:48:17.428
That was really close.

00:48:31.434 --> 00:48:33.395
That's it!

00:48:33.395 --> 00:48:34.521
Sun Tae Hyung.

00:48:34.521 --> 00:48:36.489
There you go.

00:48:37.107 --> 00:48:38.949
Come on, Tae Hyung.

00:48:40.902 --> 00:48:42.912
You've got this, Manager.

00:48:44.072 --> 00:48:47.333
- Manager, you got this.
- You got this.

00:48:53.164 --> 00:48:56.626
As expected!

00:48:56.626 --> 00:48:58.886
Those veins are looking sharp.

00:49:01.298 --> 00:49:03.066
You're the best.

00:49:07.929 --> 00:49:09.472
Not bad at all.

00:49:09.472 --> 00:49:11.349
It's your final throw.

00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:13.609
It's not over yet.

00:49:14.335 --> 00:49:17.474
It's not finished until the last frame.

00:49:46.885 --> 00:49:48.470
Hey, Manager.

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:52.265
It's such a shame you lost tonight.

00:49:52.265 --> 00:49:54.392
How about just one more round, please?

00:49:54.392 --> 00:49:56.127
Have a safe trip home.

00:49:56.127 --> 00:49:57.420
- Good night.
- Hey, Tae Hyung.

00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:59.567
I need you to come by the studio with me.

00:49:59.567 --> 00:50:00.607
At this hour?

00:50:00.607 --> 00:50:02.067
Yeah, something came up with a shoot.

00:50:02.067 --> 00:50:04.569
I already got a cab, so let's take it.

00:50:04.569 --> 00:50:05.904
I can drive you home.

00:50:05.904 --> 00:50:06.988
Ride with me.

00:50:06.988 --> 00:50:07.864
Would that be okay?

00:50:07.864 --> 00:50:08.615
Wait, I could...

00:50:08.615 --> 00:50:09.491
Did you call for a driver?

00:50:09.491 --> 00:50:11.368
- Oh, yes, that one.
- Oh, this one? Yes.

00:50:11.368 --> 00:50:13.787
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:50:13.787 --> 00:50:15.463
I'll see you later.

00:50:17.582 --> 00:50:19.341
Seriously...

00:50:21.878 --> 00:50:24.972
You're actually riding with him?

00:50:26.341 --> 00:50:29.302
He and I are headed the same way.

00:50:29.302 --> 00:50:31.089
What's wrong?

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:33.431
Our cab just pulled up.

00:50:33.431 --> 00:50:35.183
I'll see you next time then.

00:50:35.183 --> 00:50:36.726
Get home safe.

00:50:36.726 --> 00:50:38.520
Unless we're in a rush,
let me hit the restroom.

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.355
Forget the restroom, just get in the cab.

00:50:40.355 --> 00:50:42.857
Oh, come on.

00:50:42.857 --> 00:50:43.942
Yeah, we're leaving.

00:50:43.942 --> 00:50:45.068
Just get in already.

00:50:45.068 --> 00:50:46.236
I can't deal with you.

00:50:46.236 --> 00:50:47.828
Get in.

00:50:57.831 --> 00:51:00.466
It's written all over your face, you know.

00:51:01.793 --> 00:51:03.169
What do you mean?

00:51:03.169 --> 00:51:04.170
So what's your plan?

00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:07.298
Your rival looks pretty tough.

00:51:07.298 --> 00:51:09.551
It's not like that.

00:51:09.551 --> 00:51:11.511
Love isn't something you compete for.

00:51:11.511 --> 00:51:14.347
In my experience,

00:51:14.347 --> 00:51:16.766
everything else is irrelevant.

00:51:16.766 --> 00:51:19.193
There's only one thing that counts in love.

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:23.739
What's that?

00:51:24.607 --> 00:51:26.192
Timing.

00:51:26.192 --> 00:51:28.278
If you miss the right moment,

00:51:28.278 --> 00:51:30.488
nothing you do will make a difference.

00:51:30.488 --> 00:51:32.866
Take me, for example.

00:51:32.866 --> 00:51:35.952
I waited too long to make things right,

00:51:35.952 --> 00:51:38.288
and next thing I knew, it was over.

00:51:38.288 --> 00:51:40.089
Well...

00:51:41.249 --> 00:51:43.960
I think you still have a chance,

00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:47.088
but you keep missing it.

00:51:47.088 --> 00:51:48.644
Hold on, you knew this whole time?

00:51:48.644 --> 00:51:49.382
That Amy Choo and I...

00:51:49.382 --> 00:51:51.259
That you guys are married?

00:51:51.259 --> 00:51:53.511
You two argue at full volume every day.

00:51:53.511 --> 00:51:56.139
It's hard to miss.

00:51:56.139 --> 00:51:58.774
Was I really that loud?

00:51:59.559 --> 00:52:01.895
I'll try to lower my voice from now on.

00:52:01.895 --> 00:52:04.481
Sun Tae Hyung, can you hear me?

00:52:04.481 --> 00:52:06.240
I can hear you perfectly.

00:52:30.531 --> 00:52:31.549
Thank you.

00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:33.225
Thank you.

00:52:35.678 --> 00:52:37.705
Feeling alright?

00:52:37.705 --> 00:52:38.723
I'm okay.

00:52:38.723 --> 00:52:42.817
The breeze is making me feel better.

00:52:42.817 --> 00:52:45.396
Let's stay and cool off for a bit.

00:52:45.396 --> 00:52:48.650
There's no way we'll find a driver right now.

00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:50.276
How come?

00:52:50.276 --> 00:52:52.995
They're setting off fireworks
around here tonight.

00:53:08.128 --> 00:53:09.845
Woo Hyun Jin.

00:53:10.547 --> 00:53:12.640
Want to go watch the fireworks?

00:53:14.801 --> 00:53:18.304
Do you want to go look at flowers?

00:53:18.304 --> 00:53:19.389
Hey.

00:53:19.389 --> 00:53:21.141
Let's go, I brought the car.

00:53:21.141 --> 00:53:23.560
There are fireworks at the Han River tonight.

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:25.527
Seriously?

00:53:37.991 --> 00:53:39.708
Thank you.

00:53:41.911 --> 00:53:44.330
We're finally seeing the fireworks

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:46.006
we missed seven years ago.

00:53:48.168 --> 00:53:49.927
Right.

00:53:52.213 --> 00:53:55.133
You must have been so thrown off back then.

00:53:55.133 --> 00:53:57.810
The way I took off without warning.

00:54:00.471 --> 00:54:02.314
Are you serious?

00:54:03.391 --> 00:54:04.459
He gave up

00:54:04.459 --> 00:54:07.170
the scholarship for me?

00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:08.188
No.

00:54:08.188 --> 00:54:10.489
Please don't handle it that way.

00:54:19.824 --> 00:54:21.375
Yoon Seong.

00:54:22.785 --> 00:54:25.587
I told you earlier I had something to say.

00:54:26.873 --> 00:54:28.841
Actually...

00:54:31.544 --> 00:54:33.554
I'm leaving soon for a language program.

00:54:37.175 --> 00:54:39.143
So...

00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:43.939
I don't think we can see each other anymore.

00:54:53.191 --> 00:54:58.120
I walked away and left you behind.

00:55:00.156 --> 00:55:03.201
Now I think I know

00:55:03.201 --> 00:55:05.878
how you must have felt.

00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:10.416
At least back then,

00:55:10.416 --> 00:55:13.461
the traffic was so horrible that

00:55:13.461 --> 00:55:16.092
it wasn't as miserable as you'd think.

00:55:21.052 --> 00:55:22.720
Now that I think about it,

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.522
you had your own car even then.

00:55:28.643 --> 00:55:31.070
That's why I turned you down.

00:55:32.021 --> 00:55:34.983
I lived in a semi-basement back then.

00:55:34.983 --> 00:55:39.161
So when I heard
you'd give up your scholarship for me,

00:55:40.071 --> 00:55:44.367
I figured you'd seen how broke I was.

00:55:44.367 --> 00:55:47.161
So I made up a lie.

00:55:47.161 --> 00:55:49.463
All because of my stupid pride.

00:55:54.752 --> 00:55:55.920
Wait.

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.180
You already knew everything.

00:55:59.257 --> 00:56:02.010
Why didn't you just say so?

00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:03.936
Now I look like a fool.

00:56:04.971 --> 00:56:07.397
To be honest, I was afraid too.

00:56:08.474 --> 00:56:11.401
I worried you'd pull away if you found out.

00:56:16.024 --> 00:56:18.659
I didn't think anything scared you.

00:56:21.696 --> 00:56:23.573
More than you'd think.

00:56:23.573 --> 00:56:26.542
But it's mostly about one thing in particular.

00:56:28.911 --> 00:56:30.546
You.

00:56:36.002 --> 00:56:38.212
Anyway,

00:56:38.212 --> 00:56:41.007
I'm glad I finally said it.

00:56:41.007 --> 00:56:43.225
Even though it's kind of humiliating.

00:56:45.845 --> 00:56:47.521
Thank you

00:56:49.599 --> 00:56:51.817
for bringing it up first.

00:57:00.276 --> 00:57:02.244
Look how big that one is.

00:57:02.862 --> 00:57:04.663
It's beautiful.

00:57:21.498 --> 00:57:22.823
Thank you.

00:57:22.823 --> 00:57:23.841
Thanks.

00:57:23.841 --> 00:57:26.101
I'll wait until you get inside.

00:57:32.517 --> 00:57:34.352
Take care on your way back.

00:57:34.352 --> 00:57:35.944
Will do.

00:57:43.778 --> 00:57:45.071
It's me.

00:57:45.071 --> 00:57:46.948
Yeah.

00:57:46.948 --> 00:57:48.449
Are you home yet?

00:57:48.449 --> 00:57:50.618
I'm almost there.

00:57:50.618 --> 00:57:51.911
When are you coming home?

00:57:51.911 --> 00:57:53.955
I'll leave in a minute.

00:57:53.955 --> 00:57:55.331
I just wanted to make sure

00:57:55.331 --> 00:57:57.591
you made it back okay.

00:58:03.423 --> 00:58:05.474
I was just about to call you...

00:58:07.218 --> 00:58:09.262
What?

00:58:09.262 --> 00:58:10.896
What's wrong?

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.475
Hello?

00:58:14.475 --> 00:58:17.945
The front door is open...

00:58:20.047 --> 00:58:22.191
Did I leave it unlocked when I went out?

00:58:22.191 --> 00:58:24.743
No, I know I shut it before I left...

00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:48.130
Woo Hyun Jin.

00:59:31.614 --> 00:59:33.920
What in the world is going on?

00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.655
Are you okay? Tell me you're not hurt.

00:59:36.655 --> 00:59:38.697
Please make sure
she doesn't get into any danger

00:59:38.697 --> 00:59:40.113
because of you.

00:59:40.113 --> 00:59:41.987
If something happens to her,

00:59:41.987 --> 00:59:43.872
make sure to tell me.

00:59:44.863 --> 00:59:46.739
Apparently the one who stole data

00:59:46.739 --> 00:59:48.988
is a temp on that team.

00:59:48.988 --> 00:59:50.429
What? Have they lost their minds?

00:59:50.429 --> 00:59:53.655
Blaming someone with no evidence is harassment.

00:59:53.655 --> 00:59:56.435
Once this project wraps up, let's go on a date.

00:59:56.435 --> 00:59:57.988
Hyun Jin, do you still

00:59:57.988 --> 01:00:00.155
have feelings for Manager Park?
