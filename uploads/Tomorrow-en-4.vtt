WEBVTT

00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:26.500
Fine.

00:00:26.858 --> 00:00:27.859
Let’s get married.

00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:29.177
You’re really marrying me, Via?

00:00:29.177 --> 00:00:31.304
Do you take Avianna—

00:00:31.304 --> 00:00:32.431
I do!

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:34.599
You may now kiss the bride.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.388
Via!

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:43.775
Your kiss looked like it
was in slow motion, like this.

00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:45.277
What if you become my first kiss?

00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:47.320
Just here.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.155
Fine,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.473
then you do it.

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:50.935
Here. Come on!

00:00:57.372 --> 00:00:58.081
Hey, Yanna.

00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:00.167
You don’t have a choice, okay?
You’re our friend now.

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:02.252
- Right!
- Hug!

00:01:02.377 --> 00:01:03.962
Is this seat taken?

00:01:04.622 --> 00:01:05.670
It’s taken.

00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:11.178
Wow, the kid’s got some attitude.

00:01:11.178 --> 00:01:13.472
Kino, I think I have a crush.

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:14.389
Who’s your crush?

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:15.932
It’s Pres...

00:02:35.428 --> 00:02:36.555
Put that down.

00:02:43.593 --> 00:02:45.386
Clean that up,
or I’ll make you eat it.

00:03:12.794 --> 00:03:14.921
Via, are you okay?
Sit down for a bit.

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:16.761
You’re not hurt, are you?

00:03:17.794 --> 00:03:18.961
Thanks.

00:03:20.974 --> 00:03:22.100
We’re just gonna get some water.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.393
- I’ve finished mine, so—
- What?

00:03:23.393 --> 00:03:24.853
Via, are you okay?

00:03:24.853 --> 00:03:26.104
- I’m really sorry.
- Luna’s coming with me.

00:03:26.104 --> 00:03:27.439
- Are you okay?
- I’m sorry. Are you sure you’re okay?

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.857
- Yeah. You okay?
- All right. Let’s go.

00:03:30.196 --> 00:03:31.221
Via—

00:03:32.188 --> 00:03:33.276
Are you okay?

00:03:33.554 --> 00:03:34.847
Yes, Pres. I’m fine.

00:03:37.741 --> 00:03:39.492
Here, that’s yours now.

00:03:39.896 --> 00:03:41.189
I’ll just buy a new one.

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.346
No.

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:44.659
It’s okay.

00:03:44.688 --> 00:03:45.856
Pres, I have—

00:03:47.957 --> 00:03:49.959
I still have another lunch box.

00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:51.955
Okay.

00:03:52.237 --> 00:03:53.238
You know what, I can take that,

00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:56.975
and you can just
have the one I bought.

00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:03.323
All right then,

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:04.851
better than it going to waste.

00:04:05.266 --> 00:04:07.752
Pres, are you sure you want this?

00:04:07.777 --> 00:04:08.971
Of course.

00:04:10.607 --> 00:04:13.565
Did you cook this?
I’m sure it’s delicious.

00:04:24.746 --> 00:04:25.784
Thank you.

00:04:48.827 --> 00:04:52.174
Via: Kino, where are you? Let’s talk.

00:04:59.614 --> 00:05:00.365
Your G chord’s good.

00:05:00.365 --> 00:05:02.409
Here. One more.

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:03.910
You can do—

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.912
Move it here. That’s it.

00:05:05.912 --> 00:05:08.832
Then the other side, lower…
this one.

00:05:08.832 --> 00:05:10.125
Can we talk?

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:14.170
Here?

00:05:15.046 --> 00:05:17.674
You said you didn’t
wait for me yesterday?

00:05:19.384 --> 00:05:21.612
Then why did Ke and Luna say
that they saw you yesterday?

00:05:21.637 --> 00:05:23.222
Waiting outside for me…

00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:28.727
I did wait yesterday, but—

00:05:28.727 --> 00:05:29.752
But what?

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.234
Mama called, so I had
to go home right away.

00:05:39.586 --> 00:05:41.796
Are you being honest,
or are you still lying?

00:05:48.538 --> 00:05:51.124
Don’t wait for me today.
I’ll go home late.

00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:55.003
Go home first since your
mom’s worried about you, right?

00:05:58.298 --> 00:06:00.800
Someone’s gonna walk you
home even if I’m not around, right?

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.053
I’m worried, that’s all.

00:06:03.053 --> 00:06:04.596
I can take care of myself.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.981
I’m sorry.

00:06:17.317 --> 00:06:18.735
Let’s get back to G.

00:06:28.078 --> 00:06:30.497
Via, you fell asleep before
checking my assignment.

00:06:30.497 --> 00:06:34.542
Huh? I didn’t! It’s right
here in your bag.

00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:36.211
See? Look at it.

00:06:41.007 --> 00:06:42.675
You’re the best, Via!

00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:50.268
Hurry up. Take a shower,
you’ll be late.

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:52.310
Oh, Mira…

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:04.906
Where’s the other lunch box?

00:07:05.782 --> 00:07:09.536
Oh, right. I gave one
to Pres yesterday.

00:07:20.634 --> 00:07:22.428
Did you finish the math homework?

00:07:22.453 --> 00:07:24.747
Ah, not yet.

00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:26.428
- You did yours already?
- I’m so stressed.

00:07:26.428 --> 00:07:28.555
I can’t even remember the formula.

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:34.518
- Via?
- Huh?

00:07:34.543 --> 00:07:36.253
Are you and Arkin still not okay?

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.286
Did he say something
to you guys?

00:07:39.482 --> 00:07:40.817
Not really.

00:07:40.817 --> 00:07:44.154
We just noticed you two
aren’t hanging out together.

00:07:47.055 --> 00:07:50.058
We talked yesterday. We’re—

00:07:50.083 --> 00:07:51.459
We just had a little misunderstanding.

00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:53.204
Is it because of the—

00:07:53.242 --> 00:07:54.322
Yeah.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:57.935
But he’s been busy with
the music club lately,

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.670
so I guess it’s fine.

00:08:00.086 --> 00:08:01.504
Let’s not talk about it anymore.

00:08:01.504 --> 00:08:02.596
Okay.

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:05.341
Yeah, let’s drop that. Let’s talk
about Pres instead.

00:08:05.341 --> 00:08:06.885
Right! What did you two
talk about yesterday?

00:08:06.885 --> 00:08:07.978
What was it, huh? Tell us!

00:08:08.344 --> 00:08:09.804
Hey, what’s up?

00:08:11.014 --> 00:08:12.515
Don’t worry about it,
I’ll take care of it.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.813
Hey, you’re getting ahead of me
in the love life.

00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:22.692
Love life?

00:08:22.942 --> 00:08:24.527
Come on. No way.

00:08:24.527 --> 00:08:26.738
Pres is just really friendly.

00:08:27.113 --> 00:08:29.491
But he makes you smile?

00:08:29.491 --> 00:08:32.660
Hey, blame your ex.
Because of him, they got to talk.

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:33.912
Oh, please.

00:08:33.912 --> 00:08:34.924
Oh,

00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:35.705
speaking of—

00:08:35.705 --> 00:08:36.689
Hurry, look—

00:08:37.656 --> 00:08:38.657
Hi, Kierra, Luna!

00:08:38.713 --> 00:08:39.744
Hi!

00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:43.053
Here’s the lunch box
I borrowed from you.

00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:44.766
I washed it already.

00:08:44.883 --> 00:08:45.967
Thank you.

00:08:47.133 --> 00:08:48.885
Thanks too, Pres.

00:08:49.719 --> 00:08:50.970
I’ll go ahead.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.347
- All right.
- Take care, you guys.

00:08:54.057 --> 00:08:55.058
What was that?

00:08:56.488 --> 00:08:57.489
What do you mean?

00:08:57.659 --> 00:08:59.953
Like… what was that?

00:09:00.647 --> 00:09:02.607
You didn’t even take the chance?

00:09:02.607 --> 00:09:04.025
That’s all you said?

00:09:04.567 --> 00:09:06.444
He was talking
to you already, like—

00:09:06.903 --> 00:09:07.904
Yeah, seriously.

00:09:07.904 --> 00:09:09.489
What was I supposed to say?

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.076
Oh my gosh, if you don’t
confess to Pres soon,

00:09:13.076 --> 00:09:14.744
I’ll do it for you.

00:09:15.203 --> 00:09:16.371
Right? Seriously.

00:09:16.371 --> 00:09:17.539
She’s too slow.

00:09:17.564 --> 00:09:18.515
Oh!

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.283
Hey, classes are suspended.

00:09:20.308 --> 00:09:21.767
- What? No way!
- Yeah, look.

00:09:21.792 --> 00:09:23.085
The teachers will
be having a meeting.

00:09:23.795 --> 00:09:24.923
Perfect.

00:09:24.948 --> 00:09:26.325
Hey, let’s drop by Sevi’s place.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.143
His house is just nearby, right?

00:09:28.317 --> 00:09:30.152
You think that’s okay with Sevi?

00:09:30.177 --> 00:09:31.110
Of course.

00:09:31.135 --> 00:09:33.205
She’s right, you’re inviting
people like it’s your house.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.606
Stop being so dramatic.
It’s fine!

00:09:34.631 --> 00:09:35.400
I’ll take care of it.

00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:37.135
Besides, I’m so tired of
eating the same food

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.283
here at the cafeteria.

00:09:38.308 --> 00:09:39.080
- Let’s eat there instead.
- You sure about that?

00:09:39.105 --> 00:09:40.273
- Yes.
- Let’s invite Sam, too.

00:09:40.603 --> 00:09:41.896
Actually, that works.

00:09:41.921 --> 00:09:44.025
She’s with Yanna anyway. See?

00:09:44.127 --> 00:09:46.045
Oh, how about Arkin?

00:09:46.671 --> 00:09:47.697
Huh?

00:09:48.172 --> 00:09:50.133
Don’t worry, I’ll tell him, too.

00:09:53.177 --> 00:09:54.275
Oh.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.265
What happened to your ex?

00:10:00.184 --> 00:10:01.311
Hey, I don’t have an ex.

00:10:01.311 --> 00:10:02.312
I don’t have an ex!

00:10:02.312 --> 00:10:03.730
Besides, he loves picking fights,

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.189
but he doesn’t even
know how to punch.

00:10:05.732 --> 00:10:06.937
He’s like—

00:10:08.901 --> 00:10:09.902
Come on, let’s go.

00:10:12.447 --> 00:10:13.531
Here, gluttons.

00:10:13.948 --> 00:10:16.534
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

00:10:16.534 --> 00:10:17.535
Looks good.

00:10:18.286 --> 00:10:19.579
Hey! Let me do that.

00:10:19.579 --> 00:10:21.331
No, it’s fine. Here, I’m done.

00:10:23.249 --> 00:10:24.834
Are you always alone
here at home?

00:10:25.168 --> 00:10:26.269
Ah, no.

00:10:26.294 --> 00:10:28.755
It’s just early, so my mom’s
out for a check-up.

00:10:28.755 --> 00:10:30.798
My sibling’s at school,

00:10:30.798 --> 00:10:33.217
and my dad’s at
work with your dad.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.471
It’s amazing, right?
They work together.

00:10:36.888 --> 00:10:37.889
Yeah, it is.

00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:39.265
Oh, my—

00:10:39.265 --> 00:10:39.974
That’s my—

00:10:39.974 --> 00:10:40.975
I got it.

00:10:43.394 --> 00:10:44.312
This one’s mine.

00:10:44.312 --> 00:10:45.351
Okay.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.234
- Is that yours?
- Yeah.

00:10:50.818 --> 00:10:53.196
I don’t like that.
I don’t like it.

00:10:53.196 --> 00:10:54.447
You don’t like action?

00:10:54.447 --> 00:10:55.323
- Nope.
- You don’t? What do you like?

00:10:55.323 --> 00:10:56.199
I want…

00:10:56.199 --> 00:10:57.408
I want romance.

00:10:57.408 --> 00:10:58.576
Are you two fighting?

00:11:02.914 --> 00:11:04.332
Why, what did he tell you?

00:11:04.332 --> 00:11:05.625
You two are always together.

00:11:06.475 --> 00:11:07.976
He didn’t say anything.

00:11:09.616 --> 00:11:11.409
Nothing serious.
Just a small misunderstanding.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.719
And he’s the one who started
ignoring me anyway.

00:11:15.802 --> 00:11:16.677
You should talk it out.

00:11:16.677 --> 00:11:18.513
It’d be a shame
to lose your friendship.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:24.936
You know what—

00:11:27.188 --> 00:11:28.856
I have feelings
for a friend of mine.

00:11:29.982 --> 00:11:31.317
Yeah, you like Luna, right?

00:11:31.901 --> 00:11:34.070
Guys! Gross!

00:11:35.488 --> 00:11:36.948
How did you know?

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.450
Sevi, it’s so obvious.

00:11:41.327 --> 00:11:42.328
Via.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.664
Don’t tell Luna.

00:11:44.914 --> 00:11:46.249
I don’t plan on confessing.

00:11:46.249 --> 00:11:47.500
You guys are so stubborn,
let’s just watch.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.459
What movie do you want?

00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:49.752
Besides, I’m graduating soon.

00:11:49.752 --> 00:11:52.046
I’m sure I’ll meet plenty of people
I’ll like in college.

00:11:52.046 --> 00:11:55.049
And I don’t want
to ruin our friendship.

00:11:56.551 --> 00:11:59.971
If you don’t confess, someone
else might beat you to it.

00:12:00.805 --> 00:12:02.974
You’ll regret it forever.

00:12:07.228 --> 00:12:08.354
What about you then?

00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:11.607
If you have feelings for a friend,
would you admit it right away?

00:12:13.109 --> 00:12:15.403
Don’t you think
they might feel awkward,

00:12:15.403 --> 00:12:18.030
and it’d ruin your friendship?

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.407
That would be a shame.

00:12:20.491 --> 00:12:24.078
That won’t happen to me.
I’d never fall for a friend anyway.

00:12:25.204 --> 00:12:26.747
Wait, girls.

00:12:30.543 --> 00:12:31.752
What are you two
talking about, huh?

00:12:31.752 --> 00:12:33.713
Ah, nothing. I was just
checking if this tastes good—

00:12:33.713 --> 00:12:34.839
UNINTELLIGIBLE

00:12:34.839 --> 00:12:35.715
Come on, let’s go.

00:12:35.715 --> 00:12:36.507
- What?
- I got it.

00:12:36.507 --> 00:12:37.758
There. Come on, let’s eat.

00:12:37.758 --> 00:12:40.386
We’re hungry, and
let’s watch a movie after.

00:12:40.386 --> 00:12:41.512
- All right, let’s go.
- What’s that?

00:12:41.512 --> 00:12:42.013
Yeah, that one.

00:12:42.013 --> 00:12:43.014
– Okay.
– Please bring it.

00:12:43.014 --> 00:12:43.764
Okay. Let’s go!

00:12:43.764 --> 00:12:44.765
You just finished it all!

00:12:44.765 --> 00:12:46.521
I told you to leave some for me.
So annoying.

00:12:46.711 --> 00:12:47.785
Here.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:48.811
Come on, eat up.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.170
Okay.

00:12:54.609 --> 00:12:55.776
Want some?

00:12:58.529 --> 00:12:59.530
Sam. Sam…

00:13:07.663 --> 00:13:09.415
- I dare you to touch me, Yanna.
- Ouch!

00:13:09.415 --> 00:13:10.708
I’ll smack you with my pillow!

00:13:10.708 --> 00:13:12.210
Hey! Why would I touch you?

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.795
I should be scared that you
might kiss me later!

00:13:14.795 --> 00:13:16.631
You talk too much,
you’re such an idiot.

00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:18.007
What movie did you even pick?

00:13:18.007 --> 00:13:18.966
You’re so loud!

00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:19.926
What’s with you, Sevi?

00:13:19.926 --> 00:13:22.887
You love adult films, but
you shut your eyes when it’s horror?

00:13:22.887 --> 00:13:24.138
Those weren’t mine, dummy!

00:13:24.138 --> 00:13:25.348
Just watch.

00:13:25.348 --> 00:13:27.391
Look at the TV. Watch.

00:13:52.083 --> 00:13:53.167
Sorry.

00:14:00.424 --> 00:14:01.509
Ouch!

00:14:11.102 --> 00:14:12.137
Via.

00:14:12.895 --> 00:14:13.896
Yeah?

00:14:16.983 --> 00:14:18.776
I can’t stand being away
from you anymore.

00:14:20.778 --> 00:14:22.029
So please,

00:14:22.957 --> 00:14:24.209
let’s fix this.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.121
If I did something wrong,
I’m sorry.

00:14:30.663 --> 00:14:34.208
If I messed up somehow,
please tell me, so—

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:40.673
because I don’t know what to
do when you won’t talk to me.

00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:44.885
You’re the one who
started avoiding me.

00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:47.221
You’re the one who stopped
talking to me first.

00:14:48.014 --> 00:14:50.516
And Kino, you’re the
one who lied to me.

00:14:51.267 --> 00:14:52.810
Via, I’m really sorry.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.061
I’m sorry, please.

00:14:54.523 --> 00:14:55.857
I’m sorry.

00:14:56.355 --> 00:14:57.982
Please, I’m sorry.

00:15:03.779 --> 00:15:04.780
It’s fine now.

00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:14.749
Why are you laughing?

00:15:21.172 --> 00:15:22.632
You look ugly when you cry.

00:15:24.967 --> 00:15:25.990
Blow.

00:15:34.226 --> 00:15:35.227
Also—

00:15:36.812 --> 00:15:39.023
Don’t give my lunch box
to anyone else, okay?

00:15:39.565 --> 00:15:40.775
That’s mine.

00:15:45.488 --> 00:15:48.783
Kino, I really made that for you,

00:15:48.783 --> 00:15:51.744
I prepared it for you,
but you didn’t take it.

00:15:52.062 --> 00:15:54.189
Then Pres was there,
and he hadn’t eaten yet,

00:15:54.214 --> 00:15:56.582
so I gave it to him instead.
It would’ve been a waste.

00:15:57.458 --> 00:15:59.335
But that was really for you.

00:16:02.046 --> 00:16:05.007
Who do you like more,
Pres or me?

00:16:05.591 --> 00:16:07.134
Of course, you!

00:16:08.344 --> 00:16:09.679
Do you even need to ask?

00:16:10.346 --> 00:16:11.347
Really?

00:16:11.894 --> 00:16:13.313
No doubt about it.

00:16:13.974 --> 00:16:17.019
I wouldn’t trade you for anyone.

00:16:21.732 --> 00:16:22.763
Here.

00:16:28.155 --> 00:16:29.162
Wait!

00:16:30.282 --> 00:16:33.661
Before you take it,
are we good now?

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.081
Friends again?

00:16:37.832 --> 00:16:40.543
Friends? Just friends?

00:16:41.502 --> 00:16:44.547
Best, best, best, best friends!

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:49.301
And our friendship won’t end just
because of a small misunderstanding.

00:16:53.764 --> 00:16:54.765
Thanks.

00:16:56.684 --> 00:16:57.685
Go on, eat.

00:16:59.937 --> 00:17:00.951
Wait.

00:17:02.064 --> 00:17:03.441
What happened here?

00:17:04.734 --> 00:17:07.111
Oh, nothing. I just
bumped into something.

00:17:07.111 --> 00:17:08.130
Where?

00:17:08.696 --> 00:17:10.030
Can I eat this now?

00:17:11.323 --> 00:17:12.324
Wow.

00:17:25.296 --> 00:17:26.088
Hey!

00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:27.631
What are you guys doing out here?

00:17:27.882 --> 00:17:29.383
We just finished
watching a horror movie,

00:17:29.383 --> 00:17:31.093
we need to shake
the bad vibes off.

00:17:31.093 --> 00:17:33.512
Join us inside, we’re scared.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.681
Come on.

00:17:36.557 --> 00:17:38.184
Eat it inside, let’s go.

00:17:38.593 --> 00:17:40.052
So stupid.

00:17:47.943 --> 00:17:48.944
Come on.

00:18:00.206 --> 00:18:01.307
Guys!

00:18:01.332 --> 00:18:02.833
I got accepted in España!

00:18:02.833 --> 00:18:03.417
Wow!

00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:04.349
Hey!

00:18:04.374 --> 00:18:06.293
- Congratulations!
- Congrats, bro!

00:18:06.462 --> 00:18:07.838
Wow, Sevi. Congrats!

00:18:07.838 --> 00:18:09.048
- He’s a Panther now.
- So cool.

00:18:09.048 --> 00:18:10.508
I hope we get in, too.

00:18:10.508 --> 00:18:12.676
- Claiming it.
- Claiming it!

00:18:13.844 --> 00:18:17.389
Wait, why don’t you look
happy about getting in?

00:18:18.933 --> 00:18:21.852
Nothing. Just some family stuff.

00:18:21.985 --> 00:18:23.236
But it’s nothing!

00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:24.396
What about you?

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:26.065
What universities do
you plan on applying to?

00:18:26.065 --> 00:18:27.817
And what course are
you planning to take?

00:18:30.277 --> 00:18:32.279
I don’t know.
It depends on my dad.

00:18:32.988 --> 00:18:33.839
Huh?

00:18:33.864 --> 00:18:36.367
Why does it depend on your dad?

00:18:36.367 --> 00:18:38.661
Shouldn’t that be up to you?

00:18:39.912 --> 00:18:44.583
Well, he’s very much involved
in my college course.

00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:49.380
Yanna’s going to
Morayta or Intramuros.

00:18:50.089 --> 00:18:51.465
She said she wants
to be a flight attendant.

00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:52.716
Sounds nice, right?

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:59.056
Even if she looks kind of grumpy,
smiling can be practiced, right?

00:18:59.056 --> 00:19:00.162
Maybe.

00:19:01.475 --> 00:19:02.505
Hey!

00:19:04.854 --> 00:19:06.443
Come on, Luna, have mercy.

00:19:07.001 --> 00:19:08.461
That’s enough.

00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:11.318
Via, don’t worry. I’ll look after you.
I’ll protect you.

00:19:11.318 --> 00:19:13.279
Wow, you guys
are so over the top.

00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:15.573
I’m just giving
this to the spiker.

00:19:17.408 --> 00:19:19.326
We don’t want her
nose to bleed again.

00:19:19.326 --> 00:19:20.703
I’m sorry, Via.

00:19:20.703 --> 00:19:21.708
- It’s fine.
- I’m sorry.

00:19:21.954 --> 00:19:22.955
Hey!

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:29.962
I promise, never again.
Never again.

00:19:30.921 --> 00:19:31.672
Hey!

00:19:31.672 --> 00:19:35.217
Bro, give me a hand.
Pres needs me to move something.

00:19:36.135 --> 00:19:38.012
You’re big enough,
you can handle it.

00:19:38.387 --> 00:19:39.847
And I’ll stay here
to keep an eye on Via,

00:19:39.847 --> 00:19:40.806
just in case she gets
hit by the ball again.

00:19:40.806 --> 00:19:42.266
Come on, bro,
it won’t take a while!

00:19:42.266 --> 00:19:43.684
You’re starting to scare me.

00:19:43.684 --> 00:19:46.186
Would you follow Via
all the way to her coffin?

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:53.599
You think that’s possible?

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.498
How though?

00:19:59.408 --> 00:20:00.951
Might work, right?
With a back hug?

00:20:05.664 --> 00:20:08.167
You know what, let’s go.
You’re insane.

00:20:08.363 --> 00:20:09.591
- Let’s go.
- Via my bag.

00:20:09.616 --> 00:20:10.755
Hey, Via.

00:20:10.836 --> 00:20:13.130
Via, Pres is graduating soon.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:14.673
When are you going to confess?

00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:15.904
Huh?

00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:19.887
Yeah. You should admit your
feelings before he graduates.

00:20:19.887 --> 00:20:23.557
He’s going away, and who knows,
maybe he likes you, too.

00:20:24.183 --> 00:20:26.644
Yeah, he said he’s studying
in Pampanga,

00:20:26.644 --> 00:20:29.605
taking up
Aeronautical Engineering.

00:20:33.609 --> 00:20:35.819
Do I really need to talk to him?

00:20:36.487 --> 00:20:38.238
Maybe I don’t have to. Right?

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:40.699
What’s with you? If you
don’t do it now, then when?

00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:42.493
If not now, when?

00:20:45.371 --> 00:20:52.002
It’s probably better to just tell Pres
how I feel before I run out of time.

00:20:53.379 --> 00:20:56.382
What if you confess
during the field trip?

00:20:57.007 --> 00:20:59.468
- The view would look so nice, right?
- Wow.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:03.263
- That would be so sweet.
- Shit, that’d be beautiful.

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:04.890
I can already picture it.

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:07.476
But you know what,
at the end of the day

00:21:07.476 --> 00:21:09.995
just do what you
think is best for you.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.075
Okay?

00:21:12.606 --> 00:21:14.316
If not now, then when?

00:21:15.067 --> 00:21:16.068
That’s in English.

00:21:16.068 --> 00:21:17.861
Yeah. It’s nice.

00:21:17.886 --> 00:21:19.208
That’s enough.

00:21:19.363 --> 00:21:21.198
Let’s stop this.

00:21:39.174 --> 00:21:40.347
Pa.

00:21:40.801 --> 00:21:41.816
Via.

00:21:45.174 --> 00:21:47.134
I got that. You should rest.

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:51.061
Wow, my daughter’s
really hardworking.

00:21:52.713 --> 00:21:53.714
By the way,

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.371
isn’t your friend’s
dad Engineer Camero?

00:21:57.883 --> 00:21:58.884
Yes, Pa. Why?

00:21:59.611 --> 00:22:02.656
Well, my boss at work changed.

00:22:03.323 --> 00:22:07.161
I think he resigned or maybe
transferred somewhere far.

00:22:07.161 --> 00:22:09.346
I think in Cebu.
Not really sure though.

00:22:09.534 --> 00:22:11.161
Did your friend mention
anything about it?

00:22:12.624 --> 00:22:15.794
Is that why Sevi looked
bothered the other day?

00:22:17.103 --> 00:22:18.363
No, Pa, he didn’t say anything.

00:22:18.522 --> 00:22:21.306
I see. I was just surprised,
that’s all.

00:22:21.331 --> 00:22:22.749
I lost my drinking buddy.

00:22:24.787 --> 00:22:27.581
Arkin mentioned you have
a field trip coming up.

00:22:28.637 --> 00:22:30.034
You should join, okay?

00:22:30.472 --> 00:22:32.140
I’ve set some money aside for it.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.974
Huh?

00:22:32.974 --> 00:22:34.267
Yeah. Here.

00:22:35.644 --> 00:22:37.354
Oh no, Pa, that’s not necessary.

00:22:37.354 --> 00:22:40.607
You don’t have to.
I don’t have to go.

00:22:40.607 --> 00:22:42.567
We can just use that
money to help

00:22:42.567 --> 00:22:43.985
with Mira and
Ysha’s other expenses.

00:22:43.985 --> 00:22:46.338
- And it’s not even required by the school.
- Come on, sweetheart.

00:22:46.363 --> 00:22:49.324
I want you to join
things like that.

00:22:49.783 --> 00:22:52.911
You might miss out on
enjoying your high school life.

00:22:53.453 --> 00:22:54.454
Come on, take it.

00:22:57.499 --> 00:22:58.535
Pa…

00:22:59.042 --> 00:23:01.878
Take it. I’m going to
sulk if you don’t.

00:23:06.383 --> 00:23:07.592
Thanks, Pa.

00:23:09.094 --> 00:23:14.683
Pa, I promise I’ll study hard
and work hard

00:23:14.683 --> 00:23:17.769
so I can make up
for all your sacrifices.

00:23:18.144 --> 00:23:20.313
Via, you don’t have to make up
for anything.

00:23:20.897 --> 00:23:23.775
I didn’t have kids just so
I’d have a retirement plan.

00:23:24.317 --> 00:23:27.153
What’s important is that you
study well and work hard

00:23:27.153 --> 00:23:28.863
to reach your dreams.

00:23:29.781 --> 00:23:31.783
And I’ll work hard too,

00:23:31.783 --> 00:23:35.287
so I can help you and your
siblings reach those dreams.

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:36.963
Okay?

00:23:38.373 --> 00:23:39.541
Thank you.

00:23:40.709 --> 00:23:41.710
Okay.

00:23:44.671 --> 00:23:45.981
But give back
the change, all right?

00:23:46.006 --> 00:23:47.173
Of course.

00:23:49.759 --> 00:23:51.386
What matters is that you’re happy.

00:23:51.386 --> 00:23:52.762
- Okay?
- Thank you.

00:23:54.222 --> 00:23:56.683
I just want you to always
have fun. Okay, sweetheart?

00:23:57.559 --> 00:23:58.560
- Thank you, Pa.
- Okay?

00:24:07.902 --> 00:24:09.154
- Hey!
- Ouch!

00:24:09.696 --> 00:24:12.198
I’m so excited to ride
the Space Shuttle!

00:24:13.283 --> 00:24:14.451
- Oh my god!
- Hey, Via—

00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:15.827
I feel like we should ride
the Space Shuttle—

00:24:15.827 --> 00:24:17.954
- then Anchors Away, and then—
- No! This is the one I want!

00:24:17.954 --> 00:24:20.248
- This is what I want, so let’s go here.
- Sevi, come on!

00:24:20.248 --> 00:24:21.221
Let’s just go there!

00:24:26.421 --> 00:24:27.672
- Yanna!
- Yeah?

00:24:27.672 --> 00:24:29.424
I wanna ride that boat thingy.

00:24:29.424 --> 00:24:31.468
- The boat thingy? What does it do?
- Yeah. The water thing.

00:24:31.468 --> 00:24:33.470
Then let’s try that
spinning thing!

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:34.929
Oh my god!

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.728
Oh my god, oh my god.
Shit, shit, shit.

00:24:59.037 --> 00:25:00.497
Hey, we’re joining too!

00:25:00.497 --> 00:25:02.040
One, two, three—

00:25:05.293 --> 00:25:06.628
Didn’t we go to
those rides earlier?

00:25:07.337 --> 00:25:10.757
It was slow at first, but after
a while, it became nauseating.

00:25:11.132 --> 00:25:12.133
I got dizzy.

00:25:13.176 --> 00:25:14.386
Did you have your eyes closed?

00:25:15.095 --> 00:25:17.389
You should admit your feelings
before he graduates.

00:25:17.389 --> 00:25:20.183
And who knows, maybe
he likes you too.

00:25:24.729 --> 00:25:26.356
That’s exhausting.

00:25:36.908 --> 00:25:38.493
Don’t vomit, okay?

00:25:38.493 --> 00:25:39.702
I’m gonna miss you guys.

00:25:43.957 --> 00:25:45.917
I don’t like this. Damn it,
this thing’s gonna go fast.

00:25:45.917 --> 00:25:47.460
I don’t like this. I’m done.

00:25:48.336 --> 00:25:49.388
I don’t—

00:26:15.113 --> 00:26:16.114
- Ah!
- Hey!

00:26:16.698 --> 00:26:17.323
Oh my god.

00:26:17.323 --> 00:26:17.866
That hurts.

00:26:17.866 --> 00:26:19.035
Okay. Get your IDs.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.493
- Hey, Kino—
- That way.

00:26:20.493 --> 00:26:21.494
- Hey!
- Okay.

00:26:21.494 --> 00:26:22.203
Give me that.

00:26:22.203 --> 00:26:23.455
- Good job!
- Wait.

00:26:23.455 --> 00:26:24.080
My—

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.098
Hey, Kino!

00:26:25.123 --> 00:26:28.126
Okay. Everybody,
let’s take a group photo!

00:26:30.879 --> 00:26:32.046
- Look at this guy’s face.
- Kino?

00:26:32.422 --> 00:26:33.089
Kino!

00:26:33.089 --> 00:26:33.465
Hey!

00:26:33.465 --> 00:26:35.508
- Hey, hey!
- Oh no, no, no!

00:26:41.264 --> 00:26:42.265
Is it good?

00:26:42.265 --> 00:26:43.099
Good, huh?

00:26:43.099 --> 00:26:44.809
Yuck. Gross.

00:26:47.353 --> 00:26:49.814
- Look . Sevi’s dizzy, too.
- That was so fun.

00:26:52.025 --> 00:26:52.609
That was crazy!

00:26:52.609 --> 00:26:53.860
- I need to pee.
- Hey!

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:54.819
I’m done.

00:26:55.069 --> 00:26:56.086
Huh?

00:26:56.488 --> 00:26:58.615
Don’t go on the next ride,
Arkin, okay?

00:26:58.615 --> 00:26:59.616
We can do it.

00:26:59.616 --> 00:27:02.952
Then I’ll just skip the next one too,
so he has someone to stay with.

00:27:03.369 --> 00:27:05.330
What are you? Twin pack?

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:06.370
Hey, there’s ice cream.

00:27:07.123 --> 00:27:08.183
Hey, Ke!

00:27:08.333 --> 00:27:09.626
I want a doughnut.
You want one?

00:27:09.626 --> 00:27:10.816
I do!

00:27:11.503 --> 00:27:12.504
It’s so hot!

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:14.881
What are you looking for?

00:27:15.632 --> 00:27:16.633
This?

00:27:19.219 --> 00:27:20.345
Why do you have one?

00:27:20.678 --> 00:27:21.846
Why are you carrying that?

00:27:22.055 --> 00:27:24.349
I always bring one
just in case you need it.

00:27:24.974 --> 00:27:27.060
Come here, I’ll fix your hair.

00:27:27.602 --> 00:27:28.728
Do you even know how?

00:27:28.728 --> 00:27:29.646
Of course.

00:27:29.646 --> 00:27:31.814
- Of course, who do you think I am?
- It’s so hot.

00:27:37.237 --> 00:27:39.239
There. One more.

00:27:41.074 --> 00:27:42.325
Wow.

00:27:42.325 --> 00:27:43.952
One more. Let me tighten it, okay?
You good?

00:27:43.952 --> 00:27:45.078
Yeah, I’m good.

00:27:47.455 --> 00:27:48.456
Does it look okay?

00:27:49.541 --> 00:27:50.375
Is it good?

00:27:50.375 --> 00:27:51.960
- Beautiful.
- Thank you.

00:27:52.502 --> 00:27:54.671
Wait. Let’s take a picture.

00:27:56.756 --> 00:27:58.508
Pose properly, I’m sending
this to Mama.

00:28:03.054 --> 00:28:04.280
Let me see.

00:28:04.305 --> 00:28:05.557
I look good.

00:28:07.559 --> 00:28:08.851
Via!

00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:10.144
- Luna.
- Come on.

00:28:10.144 --> 00:28:12.564
- Girl talk.
- Huh?

00:28:12.564 --> 00:28:13.648
Yeah, come on.

00:28:13.648 --> 00:28:14.232
Girl talk?

00:28:14.232 --> 00:28:15.233
- Girl talk!
- You stay right there.

00:28:15.233 --> 00:28:16.483
Bye!

00:28:20.905 --> 00:28:21.781
Via!

00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:22.198
Yeah?

00:28:22.198 --> 00:28:23.533
I know where Pres is.

00:28:23.825 --> 00:28:24.951
Go and talk to him.

00:28:24.951 --> 00:28:26.062
Huh?

00:28:27.161 --> 00:28:28.162
I should go see him?

00:28:28.162 --> 00:28:29.218
Yes!

00:28:29.455 --> 00:28:30.456
Come on,

00:28:31.124 --> 00:28:32.584
this is your time to shine.

00:28:32.584 --> 00:28:35.086
Tell him how you feel!

00:28:35.086 --> 00:28:36.546
Let’s look for him later!

00:28:36.588 --> 00:28:38.329
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.925
I’m really gonna confess?

00:28:41.217 --> 00:28:42.635
Maybe later.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:46.484
All right.

00:28:48.474 --> 00:28:50.893
But Luna, I don’t think
I can do this.

00:28:51.603 --> 00:28:52.854
Maybe next time.

00:28:53.229 --> 00:28:54.230
I’m too shy.

00:28:55.106 --> 00:28:56.774
Come on, you can totally do it!

00:28:56.774 --> 00:28:58.026
Want someone to come with you?

00:28:58.735 --> 00:28:59.738
Sevi!

00:29:00.111 --> 00:29:02.864
Hey, what’s that, fishballs?
Gimme some!

00:29:03.031 --> 00:29:04.824
Sevi, go with Via.

00:29:04.824 --> 00:29:06.409
Where to? She’s old enough!

00:29:07.952 --> 00:29:09.579
Kidding. Where are we going?

00:29:16.169 --> 00:29:17.587
Wait, for real?

00:29:17.587 --> 00:29:18.921
All right, I’ll come with you!

00:29:20.173 --> 00:29:20.882
Okay.

00:29:20.882 --> 00:29:22.050
- Later.
- You got this.

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:23.676
Yes!

00:29:23.676 --> 00:29:24.796
Eat with us, Sevi.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.681
What’s that? It’s delicious.

00:29:28.681 --> 00:29:29.741
Right?

00:29:34.937 --> 00:29:35.938
Where is he anyway?

00:29:43.154 --> 00:29:44.781
Am I really gonna do this?

00:29:45.031 --> 00:29:46.658
Maybe I shouldn’t…

00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:49.452
Oh, there’s Pres.

00:29:50.078 --> 00:29:51.107
Come on.

00:29:53.481 --> 00:29:54.399
Pres.

00:29:54.424 --> 00:29:55.717
Hey. What’s up?

00:29:56.918 --> 00:29:58.336
Via’s got something to say.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.979
What is it?

00:30:00.004 --> 00:30:01.464
I’ll leave you guys here, okay?

00:30:01.464 --> 00:30:03.216
I’m gonna buy some churros.
You do your thing.

00:30:03.508 --> 00:30:04.692
Come sit, Via.

00:30:04.717 --> 00:30:05.719
Sit here.

00:30:06.844 --> 00:30:07.946
Want some of this?

00:30:09.639 --> 00:30:10.640
I’ll just put this here.

00:30:11.933 --> 00:30:13.518
No turning back now.

00:30:13.518 --> 00:30:15.422
You got this, Via.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.488
Want some churros?

00:30:28.408 --> 00:30:29.742
Here, that’s for you.

00:30:30.243 --> 00:30:31.536
This is the dip.

00:30:32.328 --> 00:30:33.329
Okay.

00:30:43.172 --> 00:30:44.298
I like you.

00:30:48.428 --> 00:30:50.012
There, I said it.

00:30:50.346 --> 00:30:51.597
That’s it.

00:30:51.723 --> 00:30:54.350
Better to confess than regret
not saying anything.

00:31:01.607 --> 00:31:02.900
Thank you, Via.

00:31:12.618 --> 00:31:13.619
Thank you?

00:31:13.745 --> 00:31:14.746
For what?

00:31:14.912 --> 00:31:16.456
Is that all he’s gonna say?

00:31:17.248 --> 00:31:19.834
Should I leave now?

00:31:20.251 --> 00:31:23.504
Or did he say thank you
because he likes me too?

00:31:25.451 --> 00:31:28.204
I thought you didn’t care, Via.

00:31:36.225 --> 00:31:38.019
Want more? The dip’s here.

00:31:39.187 --> 00:31:40.349
There’s plenty.

00:31:43.191 --> 00:31:44.817
That’s all you’re gonna say?

00:31:51.115 --> 00:31:53.868
What else am I supposed to say?

00:32:11.052 --> 00:32:12.261
I’m sorry, Via.

00:32:14.764 --> 00:32:16.349
I like someone else.

00:32:20.978 --> 00:32:22.355
You’re still young, Via.

00:32:23.731 --> 00:32:25.650
The world’s big.

00:32:25.817 --> 00:32:30.404
You’re pretty, smart, and kind.

00:32:30.988 --> 00:32:32.907
Someone out there’s
bound to like you.

00:32:43.835 --> 00:32:46.337
Yeah, Pres.
Thanks for being honest.

00:32:46.337 --> 00:32:48.297
And thanks for the churros too,
they’re actually really good.

00:32:48.631 --> 00:32:50.591
Pres, I’ll go ahead, okay?
Take care.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.273
Take care.

00:32:56.486 --> 00:32:58.390
Via. How did it go?

00:33:08.234 --> 00:33:09.652
It’s all right, Via.

00:33:10.486 --> 00:33:13.164
Most of the time, the people
we like don’t like us back.

00:33:15.366 --> 00:33:17.702
Sevi, I just want to
be alone for a while.

00:33:19.662 --> 00:33:21.706
Here, take the churros.

00:33:23.666 --> 00:33:24.679
Okay.

00:33:53.863 --> 00:33:55.084
Hey, Via!

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:57.158
Where have you been?

00:33:58.701 --> 00:33:59.952
What happened to you?

00:34:00.286 --> 00:34:01.495
Why do you look like that?

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:03.831
Kino—

00:34:06.876 --> 00:34:08.753
I don’t have a crush anymore.

00:34:15.009 --> 00:34:17.970
Your hair’s messy again.
Didn’t I fix it earlier?

00:34:26.938 --> 00:34:28.564
Forget about not having a crush.

00:34:36.614 --> 00:34:37.865
Just have a crush on me instead,

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.784
since I have a crush
on you anyway.

00:34:46.165 --> 00:34:47.625
Come on…

00:34:49.293 --> 00:34:50.711
Are you joking?

00:34:52.505 --> 00:34:53.923
Just kidding!

00:34:53.923 --> 00:34:55.591
Of course, I’m kidding!
What do you think?

00:34:56.759 --> 00:35:00.054
So annoying! My crush just
rejected me, remember?

00:35:00.721 --> 00:35:02.181
I don’t feel like laughing.

00:35:02.181 --> 00:35:04.475
I don’t want to joke around
with you right now.

00:35:04.475 --> 00:35:06.602
I’m sorry. I was just trying
to cheer you up.

00:35:06.602 --> 00:35:08.062
Well, it’s not funny.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:10.731
Look at them.

00:35:12.274 --> 00:35:14.026
Wow, they look so crazy.

00:35:14.235 --> 00:35:15.569
They’re so hyper, right?

00:35:17.989 --> 00:35:19.038
Just remember,

00:35:19.573 --> 00:35:23.035
we’re always here for you.
Your friends.

00:35:26.376 --> 00:35:27.586
I know.

00:35:29.667 --> 00:35:31.043
Hey, it’s them.

00:35:31.043 --> 00:35:33.921
Oh no, Via…

00:35:34.714 --> 00:35:36.340
Kino, thanks.

00:35:36.966 --> 00:35:39.719
Thanks for being a good friend.

00:35:41.137 --> 00:35:42.138
Of course.

00:35:49.729 --> 00:35:51.522
It’s good. You want some?

00:35:52.523 --> 00:35:53.524
No?

00:35:53.524 --> 00:35:56.152
- Arkin’s a really good dancer.
-That part earlier was great—

00:35:56.861 --> 00:35:58.821
- You’re messing with me.
- Yeah, he totally nailed it.

00:35:58.821 --> 00:36:00.614
Show me, show me.
How’d it go again?

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:21.734
I thought I wanted to be alone.

00:36:22.094 --> 00:36:25.431
But I actually feel lighter
when I’m with them.

00:37:35.417 --> 00:37:36.434
Kino.

00:37:37.086 --> 00:37:38.122
Hey, Via.

00:37:40.584 --> 00:37:41.637
Let’s sit for a bit.

00:37:45.094 --> 00:37:46.303
I got you something.

00:37:46.303 --> 00:37:47.596
Happy birthday!

00:37:51.767 --> 00:37:54.311
How many times are you
going to greet me today?

00:37:54.311 --> 00:37:56.147
Couldn’t you have just
waited until later at home?

00:37:56.981 --> 00:37:59.150
It’d be weird to give you
a gift without greeting you first,

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:00.232
don’t you think?

00:38:00.257 --> 00:38:01.717
And besides, I was excited.

00:38:02.236 --> 00:38:05.447
I even ordered the materials
and made it myself.

00:38:07.783 --> 00:38:09.743
I made one for me too,
so we’d match.

00:38:11.787 --> 00:38:13.122
Thank you.

00:38:13.664 --> 00:38:14.999
Wait, why—

00:38:15.499 --> 00:38:16.500
Why is it AA?

00:38:16.709 --> 00:38:17.918
Shouldn’t one of them be an “L”?

00:38:17.918 --> 00:38:20.004
That’s the first letter
of your name.

00:38:20.421 --> 00:38:21.964
Then it’ll be “LA.”

00:38:22.918 --> 00:38:24.586
No way. That changes the meaning.

00:38:25.718 --> 00:38:26.927
Let’s try it.

00:38:31.348 --> 00:38:32.558
Give it here, I’ll help you.

00:38:36.896 --> 00:38:37.901
My turn.

00:38:46.363 --> 00:38:47.364
There.

00:38:50.826 --> 00:38:51.831
It looks nice.

00:38:59.752 --> 00:39:00.753
Thanks.

00:39:01.128 --> 00:39:02.588
Don’t take it off, okay?

00:39:02.588 --> 00:39:03.636
Promise?

00:39:04.715 --> 00:39:06.133
Why, if I take it off,

00:39:06.133 --> 00:39:08.469
does that mean we’re
not friends anymore?

00:39:11.764 --> 00:39:13.641
Hey, I’m kidding. Of course not.

00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:14.975
But seriously,

00:39:16.435 --> 00:39:20.064
what if we end up in
different schools for college?

00:39:22.024 --> 00:39:23.692
Where do you want to apply to?

00:39:25.486 --> 00:39:26.737
I’m not sure yet.

00:39:27.613 --> 00:39:31.075
But I’m planning to try at
the state university in Diliman.

00:39:31.283 --> 00:39:32.284
I’ll give it a shot.

00:39:32.284 --> 00:39:33.577
Let’s go there.

00:39:33.827 --> 00:39:36.080
Then I’ll go with you.
No matter what school it is.

00:39:36.455 --> 00:39:39.083
Perfect because there’s
a film course in Diliman.

00:39:39.458 --> 00:39:41.961
I really want to
study filmmaking,

00:39:41.961 --> 00:39:43.254
so I’ll take it there.

00:39:43.879 --> 00:39:46.090
I’m sure you’ll get in.

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:48.425
Hello? You’re smart,
your grades are all in the—

00:39:48.425 --> 00:39:50.678
- line of nine.
- We’ll both get in.

00:39:51.053 --> 00:39:52.054
Okay?

00:39:52.179 --> 00:39:53.681
Besides, that’s
still a long way off.

00:39:53.681 --> 00:39:55.683
We’ve got plenty
of time to think about it.

00:39:58.936 --> 00:40:01.188
Come on, or you’ll
start complaining again

00:40:01.188 --> 00:40:02.690
about how long it
takes us to get home

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:03.941
even though you’re the
one who insisted—

00:40:03.941 --> 00:40:05.693
- on watching our summer training.
- Fine, okay.

00:40:05.693 --> 00:40:06.360
Come on.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.361
I’m almost done.

00:40:07.736 --> 00:40:08.756
Hey.

00:40:10.155 --> 00:40:11.323
What are these?

00:40:14.076 --> 00:40:15.077
Nothing.

00:40:18.539 --> 00:40:19.790
It’s nothing.

00:40:22.251 --> 00:40:24.545
You’ve got a ton
of love letters, huh?

00:40:26.213 --> 00:40:29.717
So you really don’t plan on
getting a girlfriend this year?

00:40:30.467 --> 00:40:31.468
Do I have to?

00:40:32.052 --> 00:40:33.762
I don’t think
it’s necessary, right?

00:40:34.013 --> 00:40:37.182
That’s why I just toss
them all in my bag.

00:40:37.933 --> 00:40:38.934
You?

00:40:39.476 --> 00:40:40.853
You like someone already?

00:40:41.729 --> 00:40:42.730
Nope.

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:43.897
And it’s not me, obviously.

00:40:43.897 --> 00:40:47.568
Between the two of us, you’re
way closer to getting a girlfriend.

00:40:47.568 --> 00:40:49.361
Hello? You’ve got more applicants

00:40:49.361 --> 00:40:50.863
than a college entrance exam.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.659
I’m not. I’m focused on the
music club right now.

00:40:56.744 --> 00:40:59.413
Same here,
I’m focused on volleyball.

00:40:59.413 --> 00:41:01.665
Hope we make it to
the National Championships.

00:41:02.041 --> 00:41:04.918
You know what? I’ll be
your number one fan.

00:41:04.918 --> 00:41:07.588
I’ll be the loudest
one cheering for you.

00:41:08.047 --> 00:41:08.922
I promise.

00:41:08.922 --> 00:41:11.258
And I’ll support your music too.

00:41:15.554 --> 00:41:16.472
Come on.

00:41:16.472 --> 00:41:17.473
Let’s go.

00:41:17.473 --> 00:41:18.474
Hurry up.

00:41:20.184 --> 00:41:21.194
Wait.

00:41:22.936 --> 00:41:23.936
Let’s go.

00:41:24.813 --> 00:41:25.564
Let’s go.

00:41:25.564 --> 00:41:26.600
Be careful.

00:41:29.526 --> 00:41:30.527
Hurry.

00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:58.959
Kino.

00:41:59.139 --> 00:42:01.392
Eat first. Don’t skip your meals.

00:42:01.392 --> 00:42:03.060
I’ll go ahead so you can focus.

00:42:03.956 --> 00:42:07.001
Okay. I’m almost done, too.
Thanks.

00:42:09.151 --> 00:42:13.447
I’m trying to study this part,
I’m stuck on this key—

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:16.281
It sounds off—

00:42:16.824 --> 00:42:18.117
Arkin!

00:42:22.621 --> 00:42:26.417
Let’s jam! I found
a really good song.

00:42:27.251 --> 00:42:30.295
Naya, it feels like I haven’t
seen you in the music club for a while.

00:42:31.004 --> 00:42:33.424
Yeah, I’ve been busy
with my studies.

00:42:33.424 --> 00:42:35.384
Why? Did you miss me?

00:42:36.844 --> 00:42:38.762
What song are you talking about?

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.891
It’s a song about my crush. So...

00:42:42.891 --> 00:42:43.559
Go on.

00:42:43.559 --> 00:42:45.102
- You want me to sing it for you?
- Sure.

00:43:14.131 --> 00:43:15.924
Okay, short water break!

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.838
Kino forgot his lunchbox again.

00:44:51.186 --> 00:44:52.187
Give it back!

00:44:52.938 --> 00:44:54.523
- Lance, what’s wrong with you?
- Hey!

00:44:55.857 --> 00:44:56.899
Put that down.

00:45:00.487 --> 00:45:01.488
What the hell?

00:45:04.992 --> 00:45:06.368
What’s your
problem with Via, huh?

00:45:06.577 --> 00:45:07.743
What’s your problem?

00:45:07.869 --> 00:45:09.621
Ask her! She started it!

00:45:12.416 --> 00:45:15.377
If you go near Via again,
you’ll get more than that next time.

00:45:15.836 --> 00:45:17.671
Watch where you put that
tough attitude, man.

00:45:18.797 --> 00:45:20.257
What’s going on between
you and Via, huh?

00:45:21.753 --> 00:45:23.129
You like her, don’t you?

00:45:23.677 --> 00:45:24.678
Am I right?

00:45:46.158 --> 00:45:47.659
Can’t even answer, huh?

00:45:47.947 --> 00:45:49.240
Because you’re a coward!

00:45:50.579 --> 00:45:51.580
Coward!

00:45:51.955 --> 00:45:53.206
Acting like her best friend?

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.062
But your really just
wanna date her, right?

00:45:56.627 --> 00:45:57.628
Right?

00:45:59.713 --> 00:46:02.174
Try going near Via again,
I’m warning you.

00:46:03.759 --> 00:46:04.759
One more.

00:46:08.508 --> 00:46:09.540
Oh!

00:46:11.058 --> 00:46:12.517
What happened to your ex?

00:46:14.478 --> 00:46:15.646
I don’t have an ex.

00:46:15.646 --> 00:46:17.064
Besides, he loves picking fights,

00:46:17.064 --> 00:46:18.440
but he doesn’t even
know how to punch.

00:46:19.733 --> 00:46:20.782
Wait.

00:46:21.818 --> 00:46:23.028
What happened here?

00:46:24.571 --> 00:46:26.907
Oh, nothing. I just
bumped into something.

00:46:26.907 --> 00:46:28.016
Where?

00:46:28.415 --> 00:46:29.743
Can I eat this now?

00:46:31.119 --> 00:46:32.120
Wow.

00:46:33.872 --> 00:46:36.625
You can’t just drop your best friend
because you have a girlfriend.

00:46:39.169 --> 00:46:40.170
I promise.

00:46:42.005 --> 00:46:45.008
Go, Via! Go, Via!

00:46:50.806 --> 00:46:52.391
You’ve really changed.

00:46:54.059 --> 00:46:55.435
So have you.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.437
You just don’t notice it
because it’s you.

00:46:58.021 --> 00:47:00.440
But you’ve changed too.

00:47:04.194 --> 00:47:06.113
Congratulations!

00:47:06.113 --> 00:47:07.989
Congratulations, Yanna and Sam!

00:47:07.989 --> 00:47:09.032
Be my duet partner instead.

00:47:09.032 --> 00:47:10.492
Looks like Naya’s gonna be late.

00:47:10.951 --> 00:47:11.868
Me?

00:47:11.868 --> 00:47:12.869
Yeah.

00:47:13.704 --> 00:47:14.913
Up there on stage?

00:47:15.388 --> 00:47:16.973
Kino, no. I don’t want to!

00:47:20.085 --> 00:47:21.795
Kino, there are so many people.

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:24.840
Everyone’s watching.
I don’t think I can do this.

00:47:27.008 --> 00:47:29.261
Just keep your eyes on me. Okay?
