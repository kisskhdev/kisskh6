00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:17.184
Get away from me. Leave me alone.

[bystander 1] Are you okay?

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:28.612
-Hey, are you okay?
-He's trying to kill me.

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:31.782

[♪ pop song plays]

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.865
-Adam.
-Lucia.

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:15.492
[chuckles]

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:18.870
-Wow.
-Yeah, uh, it's been a minute.

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:20.622
How are you? I heard you moved.

00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:22.666
Uh, a few times actually.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.126
Uh, last stop was Santa Fe.

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.503
Santa Fe? I've never been.

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:29.089
I liked it. There's no skyscrapers.

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:30.841
-Lots of weirdos.
-[chuckles]

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.969
I heard you met a guy. Sounded serious.

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:36.221
-You stalking me?
-No, I just--

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:37.931
[chuckles] I'm just kidding. It's…

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:39.933
-Nick and Natalie told you, right?
-Yeah.

00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:42.644
-You know, they say things now and then.
-Yeah.

00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:44.646
I ask them about you sometimes, too.

00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:48.650
And, uh, the guy didn't stick. So…

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:51.570
-Oh. I'm sorry.
-I'm not.

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:56.325
-You still with the LAPD?
-Yeah, yeah, they keep me busy.

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:58.660
Yeah, I remember.

00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:01.580
Anyway, next project's here in LA.

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:03.707
You moved back?

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:05.334
For now.

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.836
Well, uh, welcome back.

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.087
[both chuckle]

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:14.551
Listen, I-I got a couple minutes.
Do you wanna, like, sit down, catch up?

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:17.679
-Uh, I am… [chuckles]
-Oh. Oh, right. Sorry.

00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:20.432
Your shift's about to start.
You have to get to work.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.226
I can be a little late.

00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:29.900
[radio chatter]

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.490
[camera shutter clicking]

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:42.537
Good morning.

00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:45.415
-You're late.
-Ah. Lost track of time. Not a big deal.

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.126
-What happened?
-Well, uh, let's see.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.586
"I" is a first-person pronoun.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.505
"Lose" means to misplace
or fail to keep sight of.

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.715
Very cute. Thank you, Ms. Rachel.

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.386
What I mean is, how does
someone like you lose track of time?

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.389
You got one of those mugs that says,
"If you're on time, you're late."

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:01.807
-No, I don't.
-Huh.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.434
-Well, you're about to.
-Don't. Don't do that.

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:07.646
Instead of drilling into my personal life,
how about we concentrate on this case?

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.314
-Pretty sure I can do both.
-Mm-hmm.

00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:12.609
Pedestrian v. car. Driver is cooperating.

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:14.778
Sounds like the guy just ran
into the middle of the street.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.114
No wallet, no ID,
and wherever he came from,

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.032
he didn't even stop to put on shoes.

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:20.909
The couple over there
talked to him briefly.

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:23.870
Said he was disoriented, possibly drunk.

00:03:23.954 --> 00:03:26.289
He acted like someone
was chasing after him.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:29.751
He yelled, "He's trying to kill me"
right before this happened.

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:32.587
-Did they see anyone chasing after him?
-They made it clear they did not.

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:36.299
Hmm. Yeah, so maybe he was hallucinating.

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:41.471
You're still thinking about
why I was late, aren't you?

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.557
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.768
You know that thing you said
about bugging me and working the case?

00:03:46.852 --> 00:03:49.688
I have been. He was hallucinating.
Because he was poisoned.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.065
Um, and you're sure about that how?

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:53.191
The vomit.

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:55.569
What vomit would that be?

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.238
-[Daphne] Ugh.
-[Morgan] Okay,

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:02.075
so none of you have ever had a baby
puke directly into your mouth. Got it.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.535
I saw it on my way in.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.621
-You sure this is from the victim?
-Well, he had some of it on his shirt.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.501
So, unless he found somebody else's barf
that he wanted to dribble on himself,

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:14.045
-that is my guess, yeah.
-Why is it black?

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.256
[sniffs, gags]

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.508
Oh, God. That smells like rotten eggs.

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.802
Yeah, that's because
it's activated charcoal.

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:23.221
And when charcoal
interacts with gut bacteria,

00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:25.932
it releases hydrogen sulfide,
which smells like rotten eggs.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:28.769
And the only reason to take
that much activated charcoal

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.604
is if you've ingested something toxic.

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.647
Which would explain
why he was hallucinating.

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:35.358
So either he swallowed something
accidentally or maybe he was poisoned.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.194
Next question is where did he come from?

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:40.238
Well, the victim's feet were cut up.

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:42.491
-Looks like he left a trail.
-Right.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:44.868
Morgan and I will follow the blood.
You guys head back to the intersection,

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.995
see if there's
any traffic cams we can pull.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:50.248
And make sure forensics gets
some samples of, um, that.

00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:56.546
You gonna tell me why you were late,
or are you gonna force me to be annoying?

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.465
[sighs] I ran into Lucia.

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:02.844
Lucia, the ex-fiancée who painted you that
rose that you still have on your wall?

00:05:02.928 --> 00:05:04.262
That's the one.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:07.307
This is huge. You guys haven't
seen each other in five years, right?

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.476
It's not huge, Morgan. It was just coffee.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.686
Uh, yeah, I've had that kind of coffee.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.440
And this, I'm guessing,
was where our victim came from.

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:18.693
-We're not done here.
-Morgan, I don't wanna talk about it.

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:20.779
Well, then you
shouldn't have said anything.

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:23.573
[door opens]

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:28.036
Uh-huh. Our guy may have died in
the street, but whatever happened to him,

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:29.538
it definitely happened here.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:33.333
He's got a name.
"Declan Harker, 31 years old."

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:36.711
I don't see any of the usual
household poisons, meds, illegal drugs.

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:38.755
Doesn't look like he has
any cleaning products.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.715
There's plenty of stuff here
that could have been spiked.

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:42.217
I'll have forensics collect it.

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:46.096
All this takeout. Kinda feels like
Declan almost never left this room.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.472
You think he had a job?

00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:50.100
It does have a bit
of an unemployed aesthetic, doesn't it?

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:51.977
But, nope. You see that chair?

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.354
That's a Thunder Throne V2.

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:57.065
Magnetic head pillow,
four-way lumbar support

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:59.651
-and nanofoam seat cushions.
-[audience] Oh!

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.611
And over here, we've got high-grip,

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.823
sweat-absorbent gloves
and state-of-the-art headphones.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.616
And then there's this.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:10.829
Declan Harker was a professional gamer,
an esport athlete.

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:13.748
-Video games are not a sport, Morgan.
-Personally, I agree with you,

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:16.668
but, technically, pro gamers
require heightened reaction time.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.713
So, they might not seem like athletes,
but they do train like them.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.798
-Elliot?
-Yeah.

00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:23.967
If he's not playing video games,
he's talking to me about them.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.303
Well, if our guy was so into video games,
where's his computer?

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.305
Exactly. It's not here.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.849
-Maybe whoever poisoned him took it?
-Hmm.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.232
-Who are you?
-LAPD. Who are you?

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.027
My name is Adity Shaw.

00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:45.322
My ex-boyfriend lives here. Declan Harker?

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:49.075
Is he all right?

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.454
Sorry to inform you, but he's dead.

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:54.122
[gasps]

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.083
-I'm too late.
-You're too late for what?

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:59.336
Declan left me
a weird voicemail this morning,

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.087
and I came over as soon as I heard it.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.590
Adity, you gotta help me.
It's all my fault.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.050
I killed him so many times.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:08.553
I killed him over and over again,
and now he's trying to kill me.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.190
Any idea what "I killed him
over and over again" means?

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.524
Is that more hallucinating?

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.234
Actually, we think
he was talking about gaming.

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:26.237
Declan's a top player
in an online game called Battle Dynasty.

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:28.406
Swords and sorcery, knights and dragons.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.241
You kill someone in the game,
they come back to life,

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.077
you kill them again, rinse and repeat.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.579
So, we're thinking game violence
spills over into real life.

00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:37.957
The player he kept killing found him
in the flesh and killed him for real.

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:40.126
Given Declan's voicemail,
it sounds like he thought so.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.878
We know what the toxin
was that poisoned him?

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:45.674
The ME is still running tests. Hasn't
ID'd it yet. But Oz is on top of it.

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:47.550
Forensics did find traces of blood

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:49.886
on one of the food containers
in the apartment though.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.596
Looks like somebody cut
their finger on a staple.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.848
They've tested it already.
It's not Declan's.

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:55.725
Declan was using contact-free delivery.

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:58.144
According to the app, the food arrived
about an hour before he died.

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:01.231
Maybe the killer got to the food
while it was still outside the door.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:04.109
Hopefully, when we find the guy,
we'll have a DNA sample to match.

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:06.653
And what about the ex-girlfriend?

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:09.239
Conveniently shows up
to discover him dead,

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.157
has her own keys.

00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.076
-She also a gamer?
-Yeah, she is.

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:15.662
She seems earnest though.
Genuinely broken up.

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:17.205
Willing to do anything she can to help.

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:18.289
[scoffs]

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:22.502
-What?
-Well, you're getting all soft on me.

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:25.463
Morgan mentioned you ran
into Lucia this morning.

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:28.216
-I'm gonna legitimately kill her.
-Well, don't do it yet.

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:30.343
I got her combing through
everything we found in the apartment,

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:32.262
make sure there's nothing we missed.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:35.348
In the meantime, I'll trust
your instinct on the ex-girlfriend.

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:37.100
Double-check her alibi.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:38.852
Okay.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.357
Declan and I met in-game
before we ever met in real life.

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:47.360
Battle Dynasty was our lives.

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:51.072
Neither of us really fit in anywhere else.

00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:53.700
But then last year, he quit gaming.

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:55.285
And he ghosted me,

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.997
told me not to come by his place anymore,
stopped returning my calls.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.333
Well, that must have been awful.
Any idea why?

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:03.543
[Adity] He wouldn't tell me.

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:07.047
But then, last month,
he showed up back in the game.

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:10.508
Apologized to me,
said he was a changed man.

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:15.305
[sighs] We were making plans to see
each other again in the real world, but…

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:19.642
I'm sorry.

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:23.605
Declan's computer was missing
from his apartment.

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:25.023
Any idea what happened to it?

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:26.983
He got rid of his whole rig
when he quit gaming.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:30.236
But you just said he started
playing again. What was he playing on?

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.698
I think he had an old laptop
that he'd use in a pinch.

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:35.658
-What?
-You wanna find it

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:37.535
because you think
whoever killed him took it.

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:39.204
We're considering the possibility.

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:41.331
You and Declan
didn't just share house keys, did you?

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.708
We also shared a Find My Tech account.

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:52.217
Okay. [sighs]

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:55.470
So the laptop is somewhere in this lot.

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:58.431
All right, well, let's split up, look in
car windows and see if we can find it.

00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:00.225
Yeah, I'll start on this side.

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:04.437
[phone buzzes]

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:05.522
[Karadec chuckles]

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.779
You just find out about a sale
on Tide sticks or did Lucia text you?

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.739
[sighs] Well, text her back.

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:16.116
We're working. It can wait.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.201
What, Morgan?

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.411
You guys broke up
because you put work before her.

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:22.664
You want another shot at this,
don't you think

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:24.207
you should show her
it'll be different this time?

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.917
I never said we were
going to give it another shot.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.545
Yeah, well, you didn't have to.
Your face did it for you.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:31.339
-[sighs] It's more complicated than that.
-Of course it's complicated.

00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:34.676
Relationships are complicated,
and it's okay to be scared, but--

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.344
I'm being cautious. Not the same.

00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:38.721
And you know what?
I really don't wanna talk about this now.

00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:41.641
Fine, I'll back off.

00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:44.310
Just don't want you
to be so cautious that you blow it.

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:46.396
Again.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.440
[Daphne] Hey, guys, over here.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.362
-Did you find something inside here, Daph?
-No, but look at these tires.

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:56.281
They're caked in asphalt.

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:58.867
Earlier when I was going around
getting the traffic cam footage

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.120
near Declan's apartment,
there was a street nearby getting repaved.

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.122
-This car could have been there.
-[Karadec] Good eye.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:05.915
I'll run the license plate
and maybe we'll--

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.751
-[car alarm blaring]
-Whoops.

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:14.382
[blaring continues]

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:19.554
Hey, I like your shirt.
You work for Jubilee Games?

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.223
-Uh…
-Okay, can you turn this off?

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:24.893
It's not my car.

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:27.395
You just like to run toward car alarms?

00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:30.273
Can you do me a favor
and click the button on your key fob?

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:31.608
See what happens?

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:34.694
[car alarm chirps]

00:11:34.777 --> 00:11:36.863
-Thanks.
-Would you mind opening the trunk as well?

00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:40.450
Assuming we're correct,
Declan Harker's laptop should be inside.

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:46.497
Look at that.

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:49.209
Can we talk somewhere private?

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.003
I'm a senior game developer.

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:54.422
My focus is analyzing player tactics.

00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:58.051
Declan was one of the top players
on our esports team when he was active.

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:01.095
So, you took Declan's laptop
to analyze the data?

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:02.513
That's not why at all.

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:05.934
Then explain it to us, including how
he ended up dead just after you took it.

00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:07.810
Declan's dead?

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:12.148
Declan's neighbors said that they heard
yelling at his apartment last night.

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:13.524
What were you two fighting about?

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:17.737
Hmm. Maybe something to do with
the 100 grand in crypto he had?

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.281
All of his passwords
to access it are on here.

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:22.784
That's 100,000 reasons to steal a laptop.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:25.495
I'm guessing as a senior game developer,

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.705
you knew exactly how much
he was making, right?

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.541
I took Declan's laptop to help him.

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:35.630
He wasn't just playing Battle Dynasty for
the money or because he loved the game.

00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:38.675
-He was addicted.
-Addicted? To a video game?

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.760
-Absolutely.
-[Morgan] Oh, yeah.

00:12:40.843 --> 00:12:43.888
Games light up your dopamine receptors
just like any other addiction.

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.391
And I saw it happening
because I had access to his data.

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:48.643
His play had fallen off
and become erratic.

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:51.145
-He wasn't himself.
-So, you helped him quit?

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:54.565
I was hoping it would just be temporary,
that he'd get better and come back.

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:58.486
But after seeing him in person,
I could tell that he was suffering.

00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:00.196
He had lost a lot of weight,

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.908
wasn't eating or sleeping,
refused to leave his apartment.

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:07.412
I knew the folks at Gamers Anonymous,
so I got him in.

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.122
That was a year ago?

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:11.541
That's when Declan got rid of his rig
and ghosted Adity.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.793
Well, that makes sense
why you didn't wanna talk to us.

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:17.297
I doubt your bosses would love finding out
you were helping a valuable player quit.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.464
It's worse than that.

00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:22.218
Declan had started
helping other gamers quit.

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:25.596
If Declan was so committed to the cause,
why did he start playing again?

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:28.683
'Cause that's what addicts do.

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.811
I was furious when I found out
that he had relapsed.

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:33.229
That's why I went over there last night

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:37.317
and that's why I took his laptop,
to stop him again.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.236
-What time was this?
-Around 2:00 a.m.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.280
I was there for maybe an hour.

00:13:42.363 --> 00:13:44.991
Well, that would have put you
at his place before the food delivery.

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:47.368
Did the two of you have
a physical altercation?

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:49.662
No, we just talked.

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:52.415
He was trying to convince me
that he had a handle on things

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.625
and that he just needed
to finish one mission.

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:55.835
What was the mission?

00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:58.337
It's hard to say.
There's thousands in the game.

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:01.507
Are there any that involve
killing the same player over and over?

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:02.592
Why?

00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:05.470
-Was he doing that?
-According to Declan, he was.

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:08.347
And he thinks that's the person
that showed up to kill him.

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:10.516
So, you have no idea
who that player might be?

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:12.268
No.

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:15.313

They were about to explain to me
what they found.

00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:31.370
The guy from Jubilee Games sent over
Declan's play history from the last month.

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:34.499
Declan's the knight
using the name Beast-Slayer.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:40.171
And just like he said, he keeps killing
the same orc over and over and over again.

00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:41.255
Poor guy.

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:43.216
And we know it's always the same orc, how?

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.259
Well, players can customize
their characters.

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:47.345
Their outfits, weapons, even their faces.

00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:50.014
According to the chat,
that orc is Drednog.

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:51.682
[Daphne] And he was pissed.

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:55.019
He sent a slew of messages telling Declan
to stop spawn camping

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:56.646
and that he'd get payback.

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:58.564
He even threatened to
come after him with a gun.

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:01.150
Declan wasn't killed with a gun.
He was poisoned.

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:03.027
That's one of our questions
when we find the guy.

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:06.155
But for now, strange as it is to say it,
we have a suspect.

The user information
on the account was fake.

Gamers do that so they can play
under multiple names.

From the guy's in-game chats,
it sounds like he plays at cybercafes.

-[game music plays]
-[roaring, shouting]

00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:03.272
-Hey, what are you doing in here?
-Nothing?

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:04.523
[scoffs]

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:08.986
Okay. For starters, you don't have
to hide things from me, okay?

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:12.657
Whatever it is, the worst thing that
happens is we talk about it, right?

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.035
Second of all, if you're gonna hide things
from me, be better at it. Come on.

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:23.000
-You play Battle Dynasty?
-Do you know it?

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:25.670
I'm familiar. How often do you play this?

00:17:25.753 --> 00:17:28.381
Not too much. I see it as a mental sorbet.

00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:30.091
A palate cleanse before bed.

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:31.842
Okay. Then why were you hiding it?

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.972
Bedtime is bedtime for a reason.
I didn't wanna upset you.

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:38.849
Well, buddy, I'm gonna feel what I feel,

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:41.435
but it's gonna feel worse if I think
you're hiding things from me.

00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:44.355
-I'm sorry.
-No, that's okay.

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:48.192
Just wanna make sure we can talk
about stuff like this, you know?

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.446
You and I have brains
that obsess over things.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.242
So, certain video games can be kinda
dangerous 'cause they sort of take over.

00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:57.577
I know.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.205
Okay. So, this guy
with the staff, is that you?

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:04.041
Mm-hmm. I'm a wizard.
I'm hiding from those goblins.

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:06.586
I cast a spell on them,
and now they're trying to find me.

00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:08.045
Mm-hmm. In the chat,

00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:10.047
why is that person
talking about planting you?

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:12.675
-Is that a threat?
-It is, but not in the way you think.

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:16.470
He probably wrote, "Farm me," which
does mean kill me, but only for my gold.

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:17.680
It's transactional, not personal.

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:20.057
Well, if he wrote "farm,"
then why did it say "plant"?

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:21.892
Right now, I'm playing against people
all over the world

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:24.228
and the chats are
automatically translated into English.

00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:27.523
It's called localization, but sometimes
the translation makes mistakes.

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:31.944
[Daphne] He even threatened to
come after him with a gun.

00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:33.946
Interesting.

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:38.701
Well, bedtime is bedtime for a reason.
Get in there.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:39.785
Hey.

00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:42.455
-I love you.
-I love you.

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.082
Can I have it back tomorrow?

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:48.169
Oh, shoot, I'm already outside your room,
so I couldn't hear that. Good night.

00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:59.388
Guys, it's teppo.

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:01.766
-Who's teppo?
-No, what's teppo?

00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:04.352
I figured something out. Actually,
I figured a couple of things out.

00:19:04.435 --> 00:19:09.273
Do you know that 12.6 million people
play Battle Dynasty every single day?

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:12.526
Sadly, one of those people is my son,
but because of that,

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:17.782
I learned that the game's chat translator
isn't always that reliable.

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:20.951
Still not clear on what that is.

00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:23.829
Teppo is a Japanese word
that has two different meanings.

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:25.665
-I'm guessing one of them is "gun."
-Mm-hmm.

00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:32.171
That's right. But teppo
can also translate to "puffer fish."

00:19:32.254 --> 00:19:34.548
Okay. How is "gun"
the same word as "puffer fish"?

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:37.385
That's a great question.
It actually is a nickname for puffer fish.

00:19:37.468 --> 00:19:38.761
Teppo ni ataru.

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:41.597
It means "poison cannon."
And how adorable is that?

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:43.015
We should be calling them that
from now on.

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:45.726
So, when the guy threatened Declan
in the chat, he wasn't saying "gun."

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.312
-He was saying "puffer fish toxin."
-That's right.

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:50.815
Which is why the lab had
so much trouble identifying it.

00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:53.192
I just came from the lab.
I told them what to test for.

00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:57.363
And sure enough, Declan Harker
was poisoned with puffer fish toxin.

00:19:57.446 --> 00:19:59.198
And it says here
it's more potent than cyanide.

00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:03.494
One drop causes hallucination,
vomiting, paralysis, death.

00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:05.204
Declan was a goner even without that car.

00:20:05.287 --> 00:20:06.956
Can't believe people pay to eat that.

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:08.749
I have. It's safe.

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:10.668
Yeah, it can be safe
as long as your sushi chef

00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:12.086
isn't actively trying to kill you.

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:14.505
[Morgan]
The two-year training is rigorous.

00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:17.466
Before you ever hold a knife,
you must master the knowledge.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:21.137
Know where the poison hides.
Only then can you learn to remove it.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.222
After that, you face the test.

00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:27.101
A live performance of your skills
before an expert.

00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:29.937
The cuts have to be precise,
the plating impeccable.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.939
If even a speck of blood remains,

00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:34.775
you fail,
and you have to start all over again.

00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:40.322
Until you finally get it just right,
and you pass the test.

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:42.491
If the certification is that hard,

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:44.535
must only be a handful of chefs
in town who serve it.

00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:47.455
Are you inviting me out to sushi?

00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:01.677
[Karadec] Excuse me.

00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:03.387
[chef] Do you have questions?

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:06.223
Yes, uh, we're looking for something
pretty rare.

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:07.975
For a special occasion?

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:10.770
Yes. As a matter of fact,
it's our anniversary.

00:21:10.853 --> 00:21:14.064
Nope. We saw online that you serve
something called puffer fish.

00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:16.108
[chuckles] Very special.

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:20.613
Only a dozen chefs in the US
are licensed to serve it.

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:23.324
That's right. Would you believe three
of them are right here in Los Angeles?

00:21:23.407 --> 00:21:25.409
Which is why we came to you.

00:21:25.993 --> 00:21:30.289
A man was recently murdered using puffer
fish toxin after being threatened online.

00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:32.833
The person said their dad
had puffer fish he could use.

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:34.293
And those three chefs in LA?

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:35.836
One place is closed for renovation,

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.881
one's a childless 80-year-old man,
and then there's you.

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:41.509
Any chance you have a kid
who has access to your fish, sir?

00:21:41.592 --> 00:21:46.889
I have two sons,
but what you're suggesting is impossible.

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:47.973
Because?

00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:52.353
Because there is a very careful process
for handling the toxin.

00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:56.565
All the parts that I cut away,
the liver, the ovaries, the skin,

00:21:56.649 --> 00:22:00.236
I keep in a locked container
until it's disposed of.

00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:03.989
This is the law,
and I follow it to the letter.

00:22:04.073 --> 00:22:06.116
Hmm. Mind showing us?

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.368
Of course.

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:12.665
Only I have the key,
and I take this matter very seriously.

00:22:12.748 --> 00:22:17.169
Even on the chance that someone
gets sick, I keep remedies on hand.

00:22:22.258 --> 00:22:23.801
Is that your son?

00:22:24.802 --> 00:22:27.388
One of them. Jin, my apprentice.

00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:28.764
Do you recognize that kid?

00:22:28.848 --> 00:22:31.392
There's a poster of that kid
up at the video game company.

00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:33.227
He's wearing different clothes
and he had shorter hair,

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.645
but that's definitely him.

00:22:34.728 --> 00:22:36.730
What do you mean, video games?

00:22:36.814 --> 00:22:39.233
The threats we mentioned
were made in a video game chat.

00:22:41.151 --> 00:22:44.697
My other son, Ryo, plays the video games.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.075
But I still say
he couldn't have gotten the toxin.

00:22:48.742 --> 00:22:49.994
They're twins.

00:22:50.578 --> 00:22:53.247
I swear to you,
he didn't do what you said.

00:22:54.498 --> 00:22:56.292
Please. Help him.

00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:05.259
I brought Ryo and Jin here from Osaka

00:23:05.342 --> 00:23:09.847
when they were young,
after their mother and I divorced.

00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:13.559
Jin has always been good
in school and sports.

00:23:13.642 --> 00:23:17.730
He works hard and takes an interest
in the family business.

00:23:17.813 --> 00:23:20.858
It has always been harder with Ryo.

00:23:21.817 --> 00:23:23.277
He doesn't listen.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.613
Only cares about his games.

00:23:28.157 --> 00:23:32.661
I feel like… [sighs]
…I lost him to them years ago.

00:23:33.787 --> 00:23:35.456
That's gotta be really hard.

00:23:36.832 --> 00:23:40.210
[sighs] But I love both my boys.

00:23:41.211 --> 00:23:44.423
And I have always tried to do
what's best for them.

00:23:44.506 --> 00:23:45.758
We're sure that's true.

00:23:46.508 --> 00:23:48.427
But we still have to consider
the possibility

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:52.056
that Ryo got his hands on some toxin
and used it to harm Declan Harker.

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.225
We'll do everything we can
to bring him in safely,

00:23:55.309 --> 00:23:57.311
but for that to happen,
he has to cooperate.

00:23:57.394 --> 00:23:59.480
-We're gonna need your help.
-Do you know where he is?

00:24:01.815 --> 00:24:04.276
[speaking Japanese]

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.361
[speaks Japanese]

00:24:09.448 --> 00:24:13.535
Jin, these people are from the police.
They need to speak to Ryo.

00:24:14.203 --> 00:24:15.412
Do you know where he is?

00:24:15.496 --> 00:24:17.498
Uh, he doesn't tell me anything.

00:24:17.581 --> 00:24:19.541
Um, probably gaming somewhere?

00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:22.294
What about two nights ago?
Do you know where he was then?

00:24:23.587 --> 00:24:25.756
It's all right. They want to help.

00:24:28.384 --> 00:24:30.052
I don't know. I think he went out.

00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:32.221
[sighs] I'm sorry.

00:24:32.846 --> 00:24:34.306
It's okay. Thank you.

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:36.642
[speaks Japanese]

00:24:36.725 --> 00:24:37.726
[Jin speaks Japanese]

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.311
-Excuse me.
-[Karadec] Mm-hmm.

00:24:40.062 --> 00:24:42.147
I'll let you know if I hear from Ryo.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.194
Raising two teenage boys with no mom?

00:24:47.277 --> 00:24:48.654
-That can't be easy.
-Mm-hmm.

00:24:48.737 --> 00:24:52.491
Was it just me, or did that photo album
look like Dad has a favorite son?

00:24:52.574 --> 00:24:54.994
His hand on Jin's shoulder,
looks like he's proud of him.

00:24:55.077 --> 00:24:56.370
Ryo, not so much.

00:24:56.453 --> 00:25:00.207
Yeah, or Ryo's a moody teenager who
doesn't wanna take pictures with his dad.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:01.625
[phone buzzing]

00:25:03.168 --> 00:25:04.753
Who you getting a text from?

00:25:04.837 --> 00:25:06.505
I'm getting a text from our lieutenant.

00:25:07.715 --> 00:25:10.092
It says she wants to show us something
on Declan's laptop.

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:13.095
I'll have Daphne and Oz look for Ryo.
We know the cafés he logs in from.

00:25:13.178 --> 00:25:14.638
And we know exactly what he looks like.

00:25:17.266 --> 00:25:19.435
[video game music plays]

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:22.271
[Oz] It's 2:30 on a Wednesday.

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:24.732
-Shouldn't these kids be at school?
-[Daphne scoffs] Okay, Dad.

00:25:25.315 --> 00:25:26.817
I'm just saying it's hard to imagine

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.069
throwing your whole life away
for a video game.

00:25:29.153 --> 00:25:32.656
I don't know. I sunk many hours
into NBA Jam, and I turned out okay.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.575
Mmm. Jury's still out on that.

00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:37.036
[Oz chuckles]

00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:39.204
Hey.

00:25:40.998 --> 00:25:42.583
-[Daphne] Uh, excuse me, Ryo?
-Mm-hmm.

00:25:42.666 --> 00:25:44.793
[keyboard clicking]

00:25:46.795 --> 00:25:48.380
Hey. Drednog.

00:25:48.464 --> 00:25:50.340
LAPD. We need to chat.

00:25:50.424 --> 00:25:53.302
-Once I destroy this nexus.
-Mm-hmm. Is this you?

00:25:54.887 --> 00:25:56.221
A lot of people play as orcs.

00:25:56.305 --> 00:26:00.017
Yeah, but Drednog is your username, right?
Well, one of them.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.436
Does the name Declan Harker mean anything?

00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:03.520
Beast-Slayer?

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:05.439
Everyone knows him online.

00:26:05.522 --> 00:26:07.775
Yeah, not as good as you, right?

00:26:07.858 --> 00:26:11.278
Declan was trolling you, spawn camped you,

00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:12.905
killed your character over and over.

00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:16.575
Got under your skin so much that
you threatened to kill him in real life.

00:26:16.658 --> 00:26:18.702
Am I ringing any bells?

00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:22.247
We'll refresh your memory
at the station. Come on.

00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:23.749
[Daphne] Let's go.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:35.094
[speaking Japanese]

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.892
Mr. Yasuda. His son, Ryo.
This is my boss, Lieutenant Soto.

00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:44.686
We appreciate you cooperating
with the investigation.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:45.979
Of course.

00:26:46.063 --> 00:26:47.940
We just want to clear all this up.

00:26:48.023 --> 00:26:50.776
I still believe my son is innocent.

00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:52.569
I didn't even know Declan in real life.

00:26:55.531 --> 00:27:00.077
You said yourself there are
other restaurants that serve puffer fish.

00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:05.791
The man's death you described… [sighs]
…is terrible, but my son's right.

00:27:06.416 --> 00:27:09.002
You have no real way to connect him to it.

00:27:09.086 --> 00:27:10.712
Well, that may or may not be true.

00:27:10.796 --> 00:27:13.048
Ryo, you mind if we take a look
at your fingers, please?

00:27:14.591 --> 00:27:17.052
Our team found blood at the scene
we believe belongs to the killer.

00:27:21.014 --> 00:27:23.725
That cut proves nothing.
I own a restaurant.

00:27:24.226 --> 00:27:26.478
My boys cut fingers all the time.

00:27:26.562 --> 00:27:31.191
Maybe, but this is a court order
compelling Ryo to provide a DNA sample.

00:27:31.275 --> 00:27:34.194
Whether or not we can connect him
to the murder remains to be seen.

00:27:34.278 --> 00:27:37.865
But before we get to that,
we can connect you to the victim.

00:27:37.948 --> 00:27:39.491
That's how we got the court order.

00:27:40.075 --> 00:27:43.620
Declan Harker had $100,000 of crypto
on his computer.

00:27:43.704 --> 00:27:46.248
Now, people think that crypto's anonymous,
but they're wrong.

00:27:46.331 --> 00:27:48.834
It's actually even more easily traceable
than regular money

00:27:48.917 --> 00:27:51.461
because it only exists
as computer transactions.

00:27:51.545 --> 00:27:53.797
And the crypto we found
on Declan's computer

00:27:54.381 --> 00:27:55.632
traced back to you.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.094
-What are they talking about?
-[speaks Japanese]

00:27:59.177 --> 00:28:01.597
You see,
Declan wasn't trolling you just for fun.

00:28:02.222 --> 00:28:04.141
He was paid to kill you repeatedly.

00:28:04.224 --> 00:28:05.309
By your father.

00:28:05.392 --> 00:28:08.145
[Karadec] We're guessing because
he was trying to get you to quit gaming.

00:28:08.228 --> 00:28:10.314
If Declan made the experience
miserable enough,

00:28:10.397 --> 00:28:12.274
you might end up giving it up on your own.

00:28:13.609 --> 00:28:17.446
You have to understand,
I tried everything.

00:28:17.946 --> 00:28:19.031
Now, that we believe.

00:28:19.114 --> 00:28:20.532
We wrestled with how you met Declan,

00:28:20.616 --> 00:28:22.367
but then we started thinking about
Gamers Anonymous.

00:28:22.451 --> 00:28:25.162
Yeah, maybe you were trying
to get Ryo to go to a meeting.

00:28:25.245 --> 00:28:28.874
Maybe he refused,
but you ended up going to one anyway.

00:28:28.957 --> 00:28:32.461
And that's how you met Declan
about a month ago,

00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:34.212
right before he started playing again.

00:28:36.632 --> 00:28:39.593
Declan understood
what I was seeing in Ryo.

00:28:40.761 --> 00:28:42.346
How he wasn't sleeping.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.432
He stopped going to school.

00:28:46.016 --> 00:28:49.436
Some nights, Ryo didn't even come home.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.190
I asked Declan to help.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.651
[Karadec]
But instead, it made things worse.

00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:57.277
Ryo got fed up and he retaliated.

00:28:57.361 --> 00:28:59.404
See, he knew from the in-game chats
that Declan

00:28:59.488 --> 00:29:01.448
typically took a food break
around 4:00 a.m.

00:29:01.531 --> 00:29:03.116
He even mentioned Teter's Tacos.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.452
It's a popular joint
with the late-night gaming crowd.

00:29:05.535 --> 00:29:08.413
And we have a receipt
from the night Declan died.

00:29:08.497 --> 00:29:11.833
Maybe Ryo followed the delivery guy
to Declan's apartment,

00:29:11.917 --> 00:29:13.085
waited for him to leave

00:29:13.168 --> 00:29:16.046
before slipping puffer fish poison
into his burrito.

00:29:16.129 --> 00:29:17.130
[sighs]

00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:20.842
[both speaking Japanese]

00:29:20.926 --> 00:29:23.178
Gentlemen, I think we're done here.

00:29:23.261 --> 00:29:26.223
-[both breathing heavily]
-[Selena] Just one more thing.

00:29:26.306 --> 00:29:28.350
We're gonna need
that DNA sample from you, Ryo.

00:29:37.109 --> 00:29:38.110
Hey.

00:29:38.193 --> 00:29:41.530
-Still waiting on Ryo's DNA test results?
-Yeah. Lab's fast-tracking it.

00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:43.782
We're letting the dad wait with him
down in holding.

00:29:43.865 --> 00:29:45.409
He's just a kid.

00:29:45.492 --> 00:29:46.493
Can you imagine?

00:29:46.576 --> 00:29:49.121
One of my kids killing someone? [scoffs]

00:29:49.204 --> 00:29:53.417
This will sound worse than I mean,
but I worry about it all the time.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.751
Not because of my girls.

00:29:54.835 --> 00:29:56.795
Just occupational hazard.

00:29:56.878 --> 00:29:59.673
Yeah, I get it.
This job gets in your head.

00:29:59.756 --> 00:30:01.258
I'll throw you a tougher one.

00:30:01.341 --> 00:30:04.636
What about what the dad did?
You ever see yourself going that far?

00:30:05.262 --> 00:30:07.806
For my kids? Have you met me?

00:30:07.889 --> 00:30:09.182
[snickers]

00:30:09.266 --> 00:30:10.267
Lab results.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.853
-Is it what we expected?
-Actually, no.

00:30:12.936 --> 00:30:15.313
The blood on the scene wasn't Ryo's?

00:30:15.397 --> 00:30:19.359
The lab said it's a very close
familial match, as in 90% close.

00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:22.904
Uh, it doesn't get much closer than twins.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.117
Ryo didn't kill Declan.

00:30:27.617 --> 00:30:28.702
Jin did.

00:30:34.416 --> 00:30:35.417
BOLO's out for Jin.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.336
We've got unis canvassing the neighborhood
and posted at Union Station.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.338
I sent Fogel and McNeil
to the house with the dad.

00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:42.466
They said Jin's not there
and his bicycle's missing.

00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:44.676
-We checked the dad's restaurant?
-Unis are posted there.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.053
-Jin hasn't shown up.
-He's not at school.

00:30:46.136 --> 00:30:47.345
[Selena] What about friends?

00:30:47.429 --> 00:30:48.889
-[phone buzzing]
-Guys, it's Jin.

00:30:48.972 --> 00:30:51.725
All right, everybody, quiet.
Hold the work.

00:30:51.808 --> 00:30:54.644
Put it on speaker. We have to try
and convince him to come in.

00:30:54.728 --> 00:30:56.021
[buzzing continues]

00:31:00.108 --> 00:31:01.610
[Jin breathing shakily]

00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:02.694
Jin?

00:31:02.778 --> 00:31:05.822
[breathing heavily] I messed up, Ryo.

00:31:05.906 --> 00:31:07.407
I messed up real bad.

00:31:09.326 --> 00:31:11.745
Jin, this is Lieutenant Soto
with the police.

00:31:12.329 --> 00:31:13.872
Everyone is looking for you.

00:31:13.955 --> 00:31:16.041
Your dad and your brother
are worried about you.

00:31:16.124 --> 00:31:18.794
Why don't you tell us where you are
and we can send a car to pick you up?

00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:20.378
We wanna hear your side.

00:31:20.462 --> 00:31:22.798
[Jin] It's my fault. [breathing shakily]

00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:24.216
I left the poison.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.551
Now that guy's dead because of me.

00:31:27.803 --> 00:31:29.805
I thought that's what you wanted me to do.

00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:34.434
Hey, it's all right, man. [chuckles]

00:31:34.518 --> 00:31:36.478
The cops, they understand.
They wanna help.

00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:39.564
Jin, you're young.
No one wants you to go away forever.

00:31:40.148 --> 00:31:42.734
This can go easier
if you tell us where you are.

00:31:43.819 --> 00:31:44.820
I love you, Ryo.

00:31:45.862 --> 00:31:47.864
Tell Dad to forgive me.

00:31:48.698 --> 00:31:50.158
[line beeps]

00:31:51.827 --> 00:31:55.539
Ryo, is there any place that you know Jin
might go if he planned to hurt himself?

00:31:55.622 --> 00:31:56.623
Uh…

00:31:57.791 --> 00:32:00.418
Our dad, he was always tough on us.

00:32:01.002 --> 00:32:03.922
When Jin and I needed
to get away from him, we'd…

00:32:04.005 --> 00:32:05.715
we'd go to the Hollywood Reservoir,

00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:08.135
and we'd just sit on the walkway. Um…

00:32:08.635 --> 00:32:11.680
He would threaten sometimes to… [sighs]

00:32:12.264 --> 00:32:14.015
I'll radio nearest units to get out there.

00:32:14.099 --> 00:32:15.684
Take Oz and Daphne with you.

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:17.727
-And have the dad meet you there.
-Can I go?

00:32:17.811 --> 00:32:20.021
-I can help. I can try to talk him down.
-You know what?

00:32:20.105 --> 00:32:23.066
Why don't you stay here with me
and let the cops do their job, okay?

00:32:23.567 --> 00:32:24.818
They'll bring your brother back.

00:32:27.821 --> 00:32:30.073
[whirring, beeping]

00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:36.872
[machine beeping]

00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:39.541
[rattles, beeps]

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:44.129
I got it.

00:32:47.257 --> 00:32:48.300
You just gotta be bossy.

00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:51.219
Thanks.

00:32:52.596 --> 00:32:54.306
They'll call with news soon.

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:58.435
-Hanging in there?
-[breathes deeply] Yeah.

00:32:58.518 --> 00:32:59.936
This is Jin's favorite.

00:33:00.604 --> 00:33:02.606
He'd sneak it into the restaurant
when Dad wasn't looking.

00:33:03.398 --> 00:33:05.066
-You serious?
-[chuckles]

00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:08.236
Sounds like he wasn't
a perfect son after all.

00:33:11.698 --> 00:33:13.366
Let's go get you some real food.

00:33:16.203 --> 00:33:18.371
Help yourself. Anything you want.

00:33:24.044 --> 00:33:25.212
Can I ask you a question?

00:33:25.295 --> 00:33:27.923
You and Jin looked really close
in all those pictures I saw,

00:33:28.006 --> 00:33:30.467
but it doesn't seem like
you hang out at all anymore.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:32.677
What happened?

00:33:32.761 --> 00:33:34.262
We became two different people.

00:33:35.388 --> 00:33:37.474
Jin was wrong about
all this being his fault.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:39.935
It's mine.

00:33:41.228 --> 00:33:44.564
I told him what Declan was doing to me,
and he saw how Battle Dynasty

00:33:44.648 --> 00:33:46.566
was the only place
where I felt like I belonged.

00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:48.568
Like I could be myself.

00:33:49.903 --> 00:33:51.071
I see.

00:33:51.154 --> 00:33:53.990
That must have been upsetting
when Declan was killing you over and over

00:33:54.074 --> 00:33:55.158
in the game.

00:33:55.242 --> 00:33:56.243
Yeah.

00:33:57.619 --> 00:33:58.662
It felt real.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.249
-I'm sorry. This sounds so stupid.
-Oh.

00:34:02.958 --> 00:34:04.542
-It's-It's okay.
-Damn it.

00:34:04.626 --> 00:34:07.254
-I'll just get some paper towels.
-I'm so sorry.

00:34:07.337 --> 00:34:09.839
It's all right. Listen, it's okay.

00:34:09.923 --> 00:34:11.216
It's gonna be okay.

00:34:12.968 --> 00:34:14.427
Morgan!

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:16.930
Give me a second, okay?

00:34:19.891 --> 00:34:20.892
[Selena] It's Adam.

00:34:21.935 --> 00:34:23.019
Morgan's here.

00:34:23.103 --> 00:34:24.521
Did you find him?

00:34:24.604 --> 00:34:28.066
Just his bike. His dad spotted it.
Right in the center of the walkway.

00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:31.236
Oh, no.

00:34:31.319 --> 00:34:33.738
Oz and Daphne are down below
with the divers, getting started.

00:34:34.322 --> 00:34:36.157
Chances of finding him alive aren't good.

00:34:42.998 --> 00:34:43.999
Where's Ryo?

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:46.876
Adam, we'll call you back.

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:51.548
Did anybody see where the kid
I was just talking to went?

00:34:52.549 --> 00:34:55.844
Okay, this is feeling like
more than just a teenager wandering off.

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:58.680
Yeah. Why was he drinking almond milk?

00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:01.141
Lactose intolerance, food allergies?

00:35:01.308 --> 00:35:04.144
Food allergies.
And I also saw a birthmark on his arm.

00:35:04.227 --> 00:35:05.395
And this is important why?

00:35:05.478 --> 00:35:06.980
I don't think we're gonna find Jin's body.

00:35:07.063 --> 00:35:10.358
You think he staged his suicide,
and Ryo's gone to meet him?

00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:14.112
Mm-mmm. No, what I'm suggesting is
way more out there. Just bear with me.

00:35:14.195 --> 00:35:17.907
Okay, I learned about this
in Mr. Cooper's ninth-grade bio class.

00:35:17.991 --> 00:35:22.203
Sometimes, no one really knows how often,
a pregnancy can start out as twins,

00:35:22.287 --> 00:35:24.581
but then one embryo absorbs the other,

00:35:24.664 --> 00:35:26.916
and only one baby makes it to term.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.793
But since, in those early stages,

00:35:28.877 --> 00:35:31.838
there were two separate embryos
with two sets of DNA,

00:35:31.921 --> 00:35:35.258
the baby that's born has
both sets of DNA its whole life.

00:35:36.259 --> 00:35:40.263
Mr. Cooper was boring as hell,
but a two-in-one baby? Very cool.

00:35:40.764 --> 00:35:43.892
It's called chimerism
after the mythological beast, the chimera,

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:45.560
which is a mash-up of different animals.

00:35:45.644 --> 00:35:48.813
Only in human chimeras,
it's a mash-up of different people,

00:35:48.897 --> 00:35:51.399
resulting in patches of skin
being different from the rest,

00:35:51.483 --> 00:35:53.151
sometimes two different eye colors,

00:35:53.234 --> 00:35:56.071
food allergies because the body is
constantly attacking itself.

00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:58.156
And blood that's got
different DNA than a cheek swab.

00:35:58.239 --> 00:36:00.742
Right. I don't even think that Ryo
and his dad knew about that one.

00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:03.370
I bet they thought that
we were about to match Ryo's DNA

00:36:03.453 --> 00:36:06.039
with the crime scene, and they thought
they caught a lucky break.

00:36:06.122 --> 00:36:07.290
Morgan, this doesn't make sense.

00:36:07.374 --> 00:36:10.460
You just brought back a photo album of
both boys going back their whole lives.

00:36:10.543 --> 00:36:12.671
-You've even met the two brothers.
-Did I?

00:36:12.754 --> 00:36:15.423
Have we seen Ryo and Jin
in the same room at the same time?

00:36:16.049 --> 00:36:17.884
Hold on. Are you saying…

00:36:17.967 --> 00:36:22.097
We just got played by a desperate father
and a son who are trying to pin a murder…

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.224
On a brother that doesn't exist.

00:36:31.356 --> 00:36:35.151
[Karadec] We retrieved your photo album
and had our techs analyze these photos.

00:36:35.235 --> 00:36:36.569
They've all been digitally doctored.

00:36:36.653 --> 00:36:39.280
One boy or another added
to the photo after the fact.

00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:42.200
The techs also had a sense of when
these photos were doctored.

00:36:42.283 --> 00:36:44.160
You've been doing this Ryo's whole life.

00:36:44.244 --> 00:36:49.207
Having him dress as Jin, pose as Jin,
be Jin to work at your restaurant.

00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:51.501
[chuckles] That's absurd.

00:36:52.752 --> 00:36:54.504
I cleaned up some photos.

00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:57.382
But that doesn't mean what you say.

00:36:57.882 --> 00:36:59.592
Why are you holding me?

00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:01.886
I just lost my son.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:03.596
I need to grieve.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.432
It's true that you are grieving.

00:37:06.224 --> 00:37:07.726
But you didn't just lose your son.

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:10.812
You've been grieving him for 17 years.

00:37:11.938 --> 00:37:13.857
We spoke with your ex-wife in Osaka.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.610
She told us how happy you were
when you found out you were having twins

00:37:17.694 --> 00:37:20.613
and how devastated you both were
when one of them didn't make it.

00:37:22.031 --> 00:37:26.077
And how that grief led to divorce,
and how you blamed the son who survived.

00:37:26.953 --> 00:37:28.037
Ryo's whole life,

00:37:28.747 --> 00:37:30.999
every time he disappointed you,
stepped out of line,

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:33.001
you reminded him
that you wished he was Jin.

00:37:33.501 --> 00:37:35.086
So, Ryo turned to gaming,

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:39.424
where he could be free of your criticism
and your control and finally be himself.

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:42.677
That's why when you had Declan
kill him over and over in the game,

00:37:42.761 --> 00:37:45.346
he went crazy
and he did something drastic.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:47.015
Early yesterday morning,

00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:50.018
you saw that someone
had gotten into the puffer fish toxin,

00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:52.562
and you knew right away
who took it and why.

00:37:52.645 --> 00:37:54.397
You said yourself
you keep a remedy on hand.

00:37:54.481 --> 00:37:56.775
You're the one who
gave Declan the charcoal.

00:37:57.984 --> 00:38:01.029
I didn't want my son to be a murderer.

00:38:01.571 --> 00:38:04.908
Problem is, you were too late.
Declan was already too far gone.

00:38:04.991 --> 00:38:06.451
-Take it!
-[groans]

00:38:06.534 --> 00:38:08.036
[Karadec] He fought you.

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:10.371
In the ensuing scuffle,
fell through the glass sliding door,

00:38:11.247 --> 00:38:13.208
-cutting his feet.
-[Yasuda] Declan!

00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:15.460
You tried to catch him,
but he ran into the street.

00:38:15.543 --> 00:38:17.086
[tires screech]

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.005
-[gasps, pants]
-[Karadec] You couldn't save him.

00:38:20.215 --> 00:38:22.217
So you focused on saving your son.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.177
You knew the police
would identify the toxin,

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.720
and from there, we would get to Ryo.

00:38:26.596 --> 00:38:27.764
Ryo.

00:38:27.847 --> 00:38:30.642
So, after years of wishing
that one son was the other,

00:38:30.725 --> 00:38:32.727
you decided to make it official.

00:38:32.811 --> 00:38:35.021
Ryo had to disappear. For good.

00:38:35.104 --> 00:38:37.190
That's how we met you
and Jin at your restaurant.

00:38:37.273 --> 00:38:41.319
Then Ryo disobeyed you, went back to
the cybercafe, where we picked him up.

00:38:41.402 --> 00:38:44.239
That's when he found out that
you betrayed him by hiring Declan.

00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:47.116
When the DNA came back, you must
have been just as surprised as we were

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.994
that it wasn't a match for Ryo,
so now the plan changed.

00:38:50.078 --> 00:38:53.373
Once we were looking for Jin,
we couldn't keep eyes on you every second.

00:38:53.456 --> 00:38:57.836
You had Ryo make a recording as Jin, you
changed your own name to Jin in his phone

00:38:58.336 --> 00:39:00.755
and made it seem like he was
calling to confess

00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:03.842
when really it was just you playing
that recording on the other end.

00:39:03.925 --> 00:39:06.010
Then you went looking for Jin with us,

00:39:06.094 --> 00:39:08.179
hoping we'd buy that
he'd taken his own life.

00:39:08.263 --> 00:39:10.431
Ryo's and your phone records
have confirmed this.

00:39:10.515 --> 00:39:14.561
The one thing you had to have help with
was planting the bike at the reservoir.

00:39:14.644 --> 00:39:16.187
Your phone gave that away too.

00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:18.064
You called your sous-chef
from the station,

00:39:18.147 --> 00:39:19.315
and he did it for you.

00:39:19.399 --> 00:39:20.859
Sous-chef's already cooperating.

00:39:20.942 --> 00:39:23.319
We picked up Ryo an hour ago,
hiding in his basement.

00:39:26.114 --> 00:39:30.076
All I ever wanted to do was…

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.454
what's best for my son.

00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:34.622
We know that.

00:39:35.164 --> 00:39:37.458
Ryo is a minor
and the circumstances are extreme.

00:39:37.542 --> 00:39:40.962
So if you both cooperate fully,
he can still have a life.

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:42.505
[breathes deeply]

00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:46.509
Right now,
this is the best way you can help him.
