WEBVTT

00:00:46.578 --> 00:00:47.578
Zein,

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:48.847
what's this?

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.015
What happened to you?

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.600
It’s Supremo.

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:53.544
Don't make any more offenses.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.271
Next time, you won't be as lucky.

00:00:56.296 --> 00:00:57.639
There’s this girl…

00:00:57.664 --> 00:00:59.818
I heard from some students
that she's stubborn and rebellious.

00:00:59.842 --> 00:01:00.842
Keep an eye on her.

00:01:02.138 --> 00:01:03.223
Zein, it's 7:00 p.m.

00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:09.746
One!

00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:11.064
Two!

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.647
Three!

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:22.606
This isn't an ordinary nail.

00:01:23.626 --> 00:01:26.379
There's poison and tetanus in it.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.284
Let's be grateful that
someone saved you.

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:33.250
You hear that, Zein?

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.800
Lesson learned.

00:01:35.064 --> 00:01:37.358
It's better to hold your pee in

00:01:37.694 --> 00:01:39.237
instead of risking your life.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.805
Sorry, Van.

00:01:40.806 --> 00:01:41.890
Look who's apologizing.

00:01:41.891 --> 00:01:43.017
Sorry guys.

00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:44.851
We're going to be late.

00:01:44.852 --> 00:01:45.852
Let’s go?

00:01:46.604 --> 00:01:48.856
Are you sure you're not
going to class?

00:01:49.273 --> 00:01:50.900
I want to stay by Matt's side.

00:01:51.525 --> 00:01:54.612
It's my fault this
happened to him.

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:57.615
Okay, we'll head out.

00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:02.535
Zein...

00:02:02.703 --> 00:02:04.288
you take care of Matt, okay?

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.541
Keep your eyes on him!

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.124
On Matt!

00:02:10.211 --> 00:02:11.295
Alright, I hear you.

00:02:31.065 --> 00:02:32.065
Matt...

00:02:33.442 --> 00:02:34.944
are you awake?

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.488
How are you feeling?

00:02:37.863 --> 00:02:39.407
Are you hurt?

00:02:40.616 --> 00:02:41.992
Are you okay?

00:02:43.744 --> 00:02:44.744
Hey...

00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:46.038
Are you hungry?

00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:48.456
Thirsty?

00:04:52.373 --> 00:04:53.373
Matt...

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.325
Have you gone insane?

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.196
Or has the poison reached your brain?

00:05:01.156 --> 00:05:02.156
Pepper.

00:05:03.325 --> 00:05:05.034
This will purge-

00:05:05.035 --> 00:05:06.869
the rest of the poison from my body.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.204
It's so spicy!

00:05:08.205 --> 00:05:09.831
It's too hot!

00:05:12.376 --> 00:05:13.377
You find that funny?

00:05:18.673 --> 00:05:19.299
Hey!

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.509
Why did you block it?

00:05:20.926 --> 00:05:23.260
If I only knew you we're joking,

00:05:23.354 --> 00:05:25.302
I would've punched you harder.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.516
You thought the BBG’s nail was lethal?

00:05:28.517 --> 00:05:30.352
Wait until you taste this.

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:33.438
Let me see this...

00:05:33.438 --> 00:05:34.189
This?

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.689
That's nothing!

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.483
So you're challenging me?

00:05:37.484 --> 00:05:38.193
You bet!

00:05:38.194 --> 00:05:39.276
- Come on.
- Game?

00:05:39.277 --> 00:05:39.736
Let's do it!

00:05:39.736 --> 00:05:40.695
- Get ready!
- Try me.

00:05:40.695 --> 00:05:41.695
Game.

00:05:43.073 --> 00:05:43.907
Give me your best shot.

00:05:43.908 --> 00:05:45.200
- Can you handle it?
- Of course!

00:05:50.247 --> 00:05:51.832
How dare you!

00:06:02.175 --> 00:06:03.176
You know...

00:06:03.301 --> 00:06:04.189
Zein...

00:06:05.262 --> 00:06:06.262
Zein.

00:06:06.388 --> 00:06:07.639
Thank you.

00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:24.489
Zein...

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.531
I wanted to thank you.

00:06:25.532 --> 00:06:27.576
Cause even if it was dangerous out there

00:06:27.826 --> 00:06:29.077
you still didn't leave me.

00:06:30.745 --> 00:06:33.665
Sorry if you almost got hurt because of me.

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:35.292
Sorry...

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.835
Sorry?

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.129
It was my fault.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.716
What happened to you was my fault.

00:06:44.176 --> 00:06:45.635
I just did the right thing.

00:06:46.845 --> 00:06:47.929
It was nothing.

00:06:50.182 --> 00:06:51.224
You know...

00:06:52.434 --> 00:06:54.352
before I fainted.

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:01.109
I saw the guy with the mask.

00:07:01.902 --> 00:07:05.280
His mask was red while
the ones chasing us

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.199
their masks were black.

00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:10.827
What if...

00:07:12.496 --> 00:07:16.374
their gangs have
designated mask colors?

00:07:17.792 --> 00:07:18.793
Right?

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:21.963
If the ones chasing us
were the Black Blood Gang...

00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:24.673
I'm certain that the one
who helped us

00:07:24.674 --> 00:07:26.301
was part of the
Devil God Warrior.

00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:29.798
I saw fear in their eyes...

00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:34.205
and their knees were shaking.

00:07:35.852 --> 00:07:38.480
They all left in an instant.

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:43.235
That guy must not be
an ordinary member.

00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:46.404
I think...

00:07:48.281 --> 00:07:50.492
he must be Raze Silvenia.

00:07:50.825 --> 00:07:53.662
The leader of the
Devil God Warrior.

00:07:54.871 --> 00:07:56.873
But why would he help us?

00:07:58.959 --> 00:07:59.543
I don't know either, Zein.

00:07:59.544 --> 00:08:01.253
I ask myself that question too.

00:08:12.347 --> 00:08:14.140
When we were running
away from them...

00:08:14.933 --> 00:08:17.477
I already noticed
something watching us.

00:08:17.936 --> 00:08:19.854
If he's from the
Black Blood Gang,

00:08:20.438 --> 00:08:22.607
he would've killed us already.

00:08:24.859 --> 00:08:27.070
Is it possible that
Raze was there?

00:08:28.196 --> 00:08:31.157
Was the Devil God Warrior
out there that night?

00:08:32.951 --> 00:08:33.493
It's possible.

00:08:33.494 --> 00:08:35.036
But why?

00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:50.802
We won't find answers
to our questions.

00:08:51.177 --> 00:08:52.219
For now,

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.640
what we can do is rest.

00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:58.310
And try to catch up
on our classes.

00:09:01.605 --> 00:09:03.565
Let's show everyone
in Hell University

00:09:04.065 --> 00:09:06.401
that they don't scare us.

00:09:13.575 --> 00:09:15.242
We're going to be late!

00:09:15.243 --> 00:09:16.453
What time is it?

00:09:16.828 --> 00:09:19.039
I want to go to class.

00:09:19.289 --> 00:09:20.289
Let's go?

00:09:22.042 --> 00:09:23.500
We're already late.
Come on!

00:09:23.501 --> 00:09:25.086
Just a minute, it still hurts.

00:09:25.545 --> 00:09:26.545
Can you handle yourself?

00:09:31.718 --> 00:09:33.803
My lips are still pale, Zein.

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:37.389
Miss...

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.600
are you okay?

00:09:38.933 --> 00:09:40.101
Are you alright?

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:42.729
What happened?

00:09:46.103 --> 00:09:47.188
No, please!

00:09:59.454 --> 00:10:00.872
Good morning class.

00:10:01.623 --> 00:10:03.291
Before anything else...

00:10:03.583 --> 00:10:05.710
I have a big announcement!

00:10:05.877 --> 00:10:07.086
Well, it's been a while

00:10:07.087 --> 00:10:08.629
since we've had this event

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.216
or any event for that matter.

00:10:11.591 --> 00:10:12.884
That is why

00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:15.219
I am so happy to announce

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.764
on behalf of the
Hell U administration

00:10:17.972 --> 00:10:20.892
that we will be having another

00:10:22.435 --> 00:10:24.104
acquaintance party!

00:10:31.403 --> 00:10:34.614
I know. I'm sure you're all excited.

00:10:34.781 --> 00:10:35.906
That's why we hope

00:10:35.907 --> 00:10:37.950
that you keep that enthusiasm

00:10:37.951 --> 00:10:40.577
as we roll out details
in the incoming days.

00:10:40.578 --> 00:10:41.996
Teacher Kath?

00:10:43.915 --> 00:10:45.166
Yes, Celine?

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.379
I think...

00:10:49.883 --> 00:10:54.387
this isn't the right time to celebrate.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:59.848
Especially from the deaths
these past few weeks...

00:11:00.432 --> 00:11:03.226
It is unfortunately out
of my hands, Celine.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.271
Madam Violet has
made her decision.

00:11:06.646 --> 00:11:08.480
And things are already moving

00:11:08.481 --> 00:11:10.232
to have it done by this Friday.

00:11:10.233 --> 00:11:11.233
But...

00:11:11.568 --> 00:11:14.362
don't you also have
the power to stop the event?

00:11:14.863 --> 00:11:16.613
Maybe you could reason
with Madam Violet-

00:11:16.614 --> 00:11:17.871
Enough, Celine!

00:11:18.658 --> 00:11:19.826
Like I said...

00:11:20.076 --> 00:11:23.371
more details will be rolled
over the coming days.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.876
Now, we still have class.

00:11:28.251 --> 00:11:29.251
Let's start!

00:11:29.627 --> 00:11:31.837
So last time if you remember,

00:11:31.939 --> 00:11:34.910
we talked about energy, right?

00:11:35.425 --> 00:11:37.886
Potential and kinetic energy.

00:11:38.553 --> 00:11:40.221
Acquaintance party?

00:11:40.896 --> 00:11:42.522
What are they planning to do?

00:11:43.223 --> 00:11:44.325
Whatever they're planning on

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.278
and whoever started this...

00:11:47.895 --> 00:11:50.300
my friends and I aren't pushovers.

00:11:51.057 --> 00:11:52.892
We're not afraid of you...

00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:54.694
The admin,

00:11:55.278 --> 00:11:56.696
the Black Blood Gang,

00:11:57.363 --> 00:11:59.032
or the Devil God Warrior.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.869
They should be the
ones afraid of us.

00:12:40.351 --> 00:12:41.728
Excuse me, sir?

00:12:42.826 --> 00:12:43.660
Boss...

00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:45.912
Is this your only branch?
Or are there others?

00:12:46.788 --> 00:12:47.747
Don't be rude!

00:12:47.748 --> 00:12:49.081
Thank you!

00:12:49.082 --> 00:12:50.082
Thank you.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.420
Matt...

00:12:55.463 --> 00:12:57.173
you sure you're okay?

00:12:57.549 --> 00:12:59.007
Don't you need to rest more?

00:12:59.108 --> 00:13:00.151
I'm okay.

00:13:00.253 --> 00:13:03.207
The pepper took care
of the poison.

00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:06.098
Eat another one so you're sure.

00:13:06.099 --> 00:13:07.558
Purge it out of you.

00:13:07.559 --> 00:13:08.685
What?

00:13:09.379 --> 00:13:10.103
You know what...

00:13:10.104 --> 00:13:12.188
while you're busy with
your inside jokes

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.982
Dave and Jerome have
been looking for ways

00:13:14.983 --> 00:13:16.693
to escape this place.

00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:18.987
Because of what happened
with you both last night...

00:13:19.237 --> 00:13:19.988
my God!

00:13:19.989 --> 00:13:22.490
We need to act faster.

00:13:22.824 --> 00:13:24.742
We tried to find the road
that led us here...

00:13:26.244 --> 00:13:28.120
but it's so strange

00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:29.873
it seems like the roads
have changed.

00:13:30.915 --> 00:13:32.625
Any road we walk on...

00:13:33.293 --> 00:13:34.919
it leads us to nowhere.

00:13:35.587 --> 00:13:36.963
What are we going to do?

00:13:37.755 --> 00:13:39.966
We entered this
place unknowingly...

00:13:40.981 --> 00:13:43.340
We don't know it's history

00:13:43.979 --> 00:13:45.648
or who runs this place.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:47.599
We need information

00:13:48.231 --> 00:13:49.482
so we can fight back

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.463
and escape.

00:13:51.936 --> 00:13:53.897
If we need to kill

00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:55.732
to escape, so be it!

00:13:57.525 --> 00:13:59.568
We need to strike first

00:13:59.569 --> 00:14:01.446
to get leverage.

00:14:02.619 --> 00:14:04.705
From the tone of that voice of yours...

00:14:04.908 --> 00:14:06.659
I'm sure you have a plan.

00:14:06.868 --> 00:14:07.911
Celine.

00:14:08.369 --> 00:14:09.661
She knows something.

00:14:09.662 --> 00:14:11.456
I thought of the same thing...

00:14:11.915 --> 00:14:13.958
but she's wary of us.

00:14:14.558 --> 00:14:16.227
It's like she's afraid of us.

00:14:16.384 --> 00:14:17.469
I'll handle that.

00:14:18.504 --> 00:14:21.466
Maybe she has information
about the gangs here too...

00:14:21.722 --> 00:14:24.141
We need to find a way
to deal with those gangs.

00:14:24.512 --> 00:14:25.512
No!

00:14:26.804 --> 00:14:27.846
I don't think it's the right decision

00:14:27.847 --> 00:14:29.390
to meddle with the gangs.

00:14:30.254 --> 00:14:31.893
Why are you overreacting?

00:14:33.561 --> 00:14:34.771
It's not like that.

00:14:35.688 --> 00:14:37.398
But after what happened
last night...

00:14:37.857 --> 00:14:39.066
maybe it's better to investigate

00:14:39.067 --> 00:14:40.526
about the University itself?

00:14:41.861 --> 00:14:43.320
If the gangs find out that

00:14:43.321 --> 00:14:45.572
we're asking too many
questions about them...

00:14:45.573 --> 00:14:47.200
we can get hurt.

00:14:47.951 --> 00:14:48.951
Dave.

00:14:49.619 --> 00:14:52.413
If we know the
history of this place

00:14:53.057 --> 00:14:55.266
everything will align.

00:14:55.432 --> 00:14:58.227
The substantial part
of HU's history

00:14:58.275 --> 00:14:59.610
are the gangs.

00:14:59.963 --> 00:15:02.131
It doesn't matter which
one we prod first.

00:15:03.091 --> 00:15:05.009
We need information to fight this battle.

00:15:05.343 --> 00:15:07.469
That's why we need
to find answers.

00:15:07.672 --> 00:15:09.007
You're right.

00:15:09.305 --> 00:15:13.309
Let's try to find information
our own way.

00:15:14.686 --> 00:15:15.937
Now's the time.

00:15:16.229 --> 00:15:18.106
Let's realign later.

00:15:22.819 --> 00:15:23.820
Celine!

00:15:25.238 --> 00:15:26.405
Come on, let's go.

00:15:26.406 --> 00:15:27.573
Hold on.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.118
I won't hurt you.

00:15:31.077 --> 00:15:32.077
I just want to talk.

00:15:33.371 --> 00:15:34.955
Stay away from us.

00:15:34.956 --> 00:15:36.206
We don't want you to get hurt.

00:15:36.207 --> 00:15:37.583
It's too late for that.

00:15:37.625 --> 00:15:39.711
We've been marked since
we entered this place.

00:15:40.878 --> 00:15:42.046
Please...

00:15:42.213 --> 00:15:43.464
we need your help.

00:15:44.716 --> 00:15:45.883
Celine...

00:15:47.093 --> 00:15:48.177
It's okay.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.271
Not here.

00:16:43.038 --> 00:16:44.664
I need to ask you this, Zein.

00:16:50.433 --> 00:16:51.768
Are you ready...

00:16:53.257 --> 00:16:55.343
to trade your life-

00:16:56.204 --> 00:16:58.331
for this information?

00:17:01.302 --> 00:17:03.387
Tell me everything you know.

00:17:04.385 --> 00:17:05.970
You're brave now, Zein.

00:17:06.422 --> 00:17:07.715
You are brave.

00:17:08.424 --> 00:17:09.717
You are brave...

00:17:11.052 --> 00:17:12.220
But...

00:17:13.346 --> 00:17:14.931
they used to be brave like you.

00:17:16.265 --> 00:17:17.683
The previous newbies.

00:17:19.894 --> 00:17:22.396
They were more curious than brave.

00:17:24.107 --> 00:17:25.525
Remember.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:31.239
It's easy to ask questions.

00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:37.014
But it's difficult to handle
the burden of the truth.

00:17:39.948 --> 00:17:41.074
Try me.

00:18:10.404 --> 00:18:13.991
Hell University was once called-

00:18:14.189 --> 00:18:17.484
“Philippine High University.”

00:18:18.286 --> 00:18:20.289
Only the children of the wealthy

00:18:20.314 --> 00:18:23.539
and powerful can enter this school.

00:18:26.043 --> 00:18:27.043
But...

00:18:27.068 --> 00:18:28.234
everything changed.

00:18:28.446 --> 00:18:35.850
When the founder, Dr. Quizon,
lost his mind.

00:18:36.234 --> 00:18:38.499
He was a well known scientist.

00:18:39.868 --> 00:18:41.619
But he used this school's
high tuition fees

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:45.500
to fund his research.

00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:49.211
He slowly lost his mind

00:18:49.698 --> 00:18:54.369
and used the students within
the university in his obsession.

00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:00.079
A formula-

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.518
who can revive the dead.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.023
Immortality

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:10.772
and revival.

00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:14.279
One day.

00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:16.489
Everybody was blindsided.

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:18.985
All the exits have been blocked.
There was no way out.

00:19:19.743 --> 00:19:21.137
The admins managed to find a way

00:19:21.162 --> 00:19:25.319
to hide the whole university
from the whole country.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.436
Nobody had the power to do
anything, even the parents.

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:34.163
I was one of the first students
who got trapped in this hellhole.

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:37.301
We don't know how

00:19:38.086 --> 00:19:42.975
but it's like we've been sealed
inside a hidden pocket universe.

00:19:45.812 --> 00:19:49.566
They used all of us
in his experiments.

00:19:50.244 --> 00:19:52.999
The ones who died first
were the lucky ones.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.278
It was chaos.

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:57.213
Some tried to fight back,

00:19:57.238 --> 00:19:58.573
some rebelled.

00:19:59.205 --> 00:20:03.859
But most turned on each other to release
their rage. It didn't take long before.

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:09.184
PHU turned into Hell U.

00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:11.419
From the chaos and bloodshed

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:14.214
many gangs were formed.

00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:17.883
You already know the two
most powerful gangs here.

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:23.681
The Black Blood Gang
and The Devil God Warrior.

00:20:24.114 --> 00:20:26.624
Dr. Quizon completed the formula

00:20:27.352 --> 00:20:31.758
but he died before he
could use it for himself.

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:35.377
There were rumors saying that

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:39.923
a student got his hands
on the formula.

00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:42.909
That student is still in Hell U.

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:47.705
That's why they locked this
place from the world.

00:20:48.973 --> 00:20:54.389
The officals and the forces outside
are still looking for that student

00:20:54.414 --> 00:20:58.014
because they're desperate to
get a hold of that formula.

00:21:01.114 --> 00:21:02.114
Zein,

00:21:03.491 --> 00:21:05.348
that's Hell U's secret.

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:10.103
That's why no one is allowed to leave.

00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:13.940
They believe that student
is still here.

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:16.234
It could be anyone.

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:23.908
That person's life is in danger.

00:21:27.023 --> 00:21:28.108
I’m sure

00:21:28.588 --> 00:21:30.131
it'll only take a while

00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:33.501
before the officials find
out who that student is.

00:21:35.518 --> 00:21:37.645
You know what I'm more afraid of?

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:40.585
The formula getting-

00:21:42.385 --> 00:21:44.345
into the hands of the wrong people.

00:21:47.072 --> 00:21:49.157
And using it for evil.

00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:11.206
Now you know the secret of Hell U.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:14.501
You will never get to leave.

00:22:16.468 --> 00:22:18.053
You will die here.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.009
Do you know the student
who has the formula?

00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:26.095
If you do know...

00:22:27.388 --> 00:22:28.932
it's time to take extra precautions.

00:22:29.891 --> 00:22:31.601
Because it's hard to get
out of this-

00:22:32.602 --> 00:22:34.312
once you've become involved.

00:22:34.896 --> 00:22:36.231
You'll get involved, Zein.

00:22:37.106 --> 00:22:38.525
You'll get involved.

00:23:06.052 --> 00:23:09.389
I talk big about how
information is our weapon.

00:23:12.109 --> 00:23:13.909
What am I supposed
to do with Celine’s story?

00:23:16.187 --> 00:23:18.731
Should I tell the others what I found out?

00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:24.008
They might just get dragged into this.

00:23:29.003 --> 00:23:30.772
But if I keep quiet...

00:23:34.998 --> 00:23:37.000
Did you like Celine's story?

00:23:38.209 --> 00:23:40.128
You don't know how
to listen, do you?

00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:43.047
I know everything.

00:23:44.424 --> 00:23:45.425
Everything?

00:23:46.384 --> 00:23:47.635
Don't be so sure.

00:23:49.894 --> 00:23:51.938
That's only half of the story.

00:23:52.098 --> 00:23:53.850
You don't know everything yet, Zein.

00:23:54.399 --> 00:23:57.861
But you went ahead and
made yourself a target anyway.

00:23:58.313 --> 00:23:59.689
Brace yourself.

00:24:00.204 --> 00:24:02.165
You're going to die soon.

00:24:26.299 --> 00:24:27.383
What happened?

00:24:28.176 --> 00:24:29.552
Are you okay?

00:24:33.181 --> 00:24:35.475
It's Ms. Leonora, the librarian.

00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:37.101
She tried to scare us off.

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:41.064
What did she say?

00:24:43.024 --> 00:24:46.292
She said that the cost of the
information we're looking for

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.346
is being stuck here
in HU permanently.

00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:55.005
That's what the students
we asked said too.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.964
It was creepy.

00:24:58.212 --> 00:24:59.922
She kept on saying:

00:25:00.668 --> 00:25:02.044
There's a cost

00:25:04.711 --> 00:25:06.254
in the information
you're looking for.

00:25:19.227 --> 00:25:20.583
Leave this place!

00:25:21.521 --> 00:25:23.317
She didn't answer our question

00:25:23.564 --> 00:25:26.483
but she said something about
being able to leave this place.

00:25:26.984 --> 00:25:29.075
Vanessa and I waited for
all of us to be complete

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.144
before we shared this information.

00:25:33.074 --> 00:25:35.243
What is it? She showed
you the way out?

00:25:37.328 --> 00:25:40.331
We need to get up
the ranks in HU.

00:25:42.019 --> 00:25:43.019
Rank?

00:25:43.044 --> 00:25:44.212
What rank?

00:25:45.138 --> 00:25:47.487
You mean the classroom rankings?

00:25:48.548 --> 00:25:50.216
Top achievers?

00:25:50.758 --> 00:25:52.593
Not just in the classroom...

00:25:53.177 --> 00:25:56.055
The overall HU rankings.

00:25:57.974 --> 00:25:58.974
This is the list.

00:25:59.517 --> 00:26:02.603
As of now, Raze Silvenia is
in the top of the ranks.

00:26:02.895 --> 00:26:03.896
Give me that.

00:26:04.856 --> 00:26:06.524
Not that, the cookies!

00:26:07.025 --> 00:26:08.484
Jerome, you're so annoying.

00:26:11.112 --> 00:26:12.739
Nazzer Lumia.

00:26:14.574 --> 00:26:16.701
I think he's the leader of
the Black Blood Gang.

00:26:18.119 --> 00:26:19.595
Both the leaders

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.080
of the two most powerful gangs

00:26:22.081 --> 00:26:23.541
are in the top of the ranks.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.752
I don't think that's a coincidence.

00:26:27.003 --> 00:26:28.463
It could be a lead.

00:26:29.505 --> 00:26:30.757
I think you're right!

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.009
But it's clear to me

00:26:33.259 --> 00:26:36.262
that if we ask more
information about Hell University,

00:26:36.429 --> 00:26:38.264
we'll be in more danger
that we already are.

00:26:38.556 --> 00:26:42.477
Information about this school,
the gangs...

00:26:45.438 --> 00:26:46.522
But this...

00:26:47.148 --> 00:26:48.024
I'm sure if we try to get into the ranks

00:26:48.025 --> 00:26:49.650
we won't be hurt.

00:26:49.984 --> 00:26:51.652
We just need to be good students.

00:26:52.445 --> 00:26:55.656
We need to work hard to
get into the top ten rank.

00:26:56.532 --> 00:26:58.326
We'll make it out alive.

00:27:00.203 --> 00:27:01.370
How about you, Zein?

00:27:01.621 --> 00:27:03.289
Did you find any answers?

00:27:05.708 --> 00:27:09.128
What did Celine tell you?

00:27:13.007 --> 00:27:15.813
I cannot tell them what I found out.

00:27:49.752 --> 00:27:53.172
Give me that! Hey!

00:28:52.634 --> 00:28:54.334
That's his third warning.

00:28:54.503 --> 00:28:55.295
Really?

00:28:55.401 --> 00:28:56.736
That's the last warning.

00:28:56.861 --> 00:28:59.071
They might bring him to
the Dark Hell Jail.

00:29:11.792 --> 00:29:13.169
As you can see

00:29:13.836 --> 00:29:16.212
the festival committee is
working so hard

00:29:16.213 --> 00:29:18.921
to finish the decorations
for this Friday's event.

00:29:21.452 --> 00:29:23.120
Despite the very tight schedule,

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.554
they're doing everything they can

00:29:24.555 --> 00:29:26.599
to make it as smooth as possible.

00:29:26.974 --> 00:29:29.268
I'm sure you've guessed from the decor

00:29:29.894 --> 00:29:31.718
but I'm going to make it official.

00:29:32.162 --> 00:29:34.190
That this Friday's event

00:29:34.611 --> 00:29:38.185
is going to be a masquerade.

00:29:43.787 --> 00:29:46.832
Masks are mandatory.

00:29:47.554 --> 00:29:50.557
While we encourage creativity

00:29:51.089 --> 00:29:53.383
and freedom of expression,

00:29:54.611 --> 00:29:58.824
we highly prohibit the use of two colors.

00:30:00.001 --> 00:30:02.209
Red and black.

00:30:04.006 --> 00:30:06.717
These colors are exclusive

00:30:07.094 --> 00:30:12.318
for the Devil God Warrior and
the Black Blood Gang.

00:30:13.312 --> 00:30:16.052
Non members cannot
use these colors.

00:30:16.315 --> 00:30:20.403
To ensure compliance, we're gonna
send your outfits to your dorm.

00:30:20.778 --> 00:30:23.698
Feel free to make your masks.

00:30:24.205 --> 00:30:28.042
We'll call next Friday,
Free Bloody Night.

00:30:28.972 --> 00:30:32.623
Where killing is prohibited.

00:30:35.251 --> 00:30:38.123
Breaking this rule

00:30:39.505 --> 00:30:43.873
is punishable by death.

00:30:54.645 --> 00:30:58.398
Now, I'd like to call on
Supreme Student President.

00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:01.381
Ace Craige for more announcements.

00:31:13.039 --> 00:31:15.357
Thank you, Madam Violet.

00:31:16.852 --> 00:31:18.728
Some pressing concerns will

00:31:18.753 --> 00:31:22.214
prevent me from attending
this Friday's festivities.

00:31:23.507 --> 00:31:27.344
In short, I won't be there.

00:31:29.013 --> 00:31:30.389
Why is he not attending?

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.850
But beware...

00:31:35.186 --> 00:31:36.437
I will be watching you.

00:32:12.348 --> 00:32:16.602
Wanted: Supreme Student
Government Secretary.

00:32:26.794 --> 00:32:29.922
Aren’t you going to
step out of my way?

00:32:33.668 --> 00:32:34.669
Should I?

00:32:35.162 --> 00:32:38.749
I'm the Supreme Student
Government Secretary here.

00:32:39.079 --> 00:32:42.166
Miss... I don't care who you are.

00:32:45.214 --> 00:32:47.091
Former secretary.

00:32:47.675 --> 00:32:48.843
Can't you read?

00:32:49.426 --> 00:32:51.178
Or should I read it for you?

00:32:51.846 --> 00:32:53.764
That's just a paper.

00:32:54.265 --> 00:32:56.475
A mistake, obviously!

00:32:56.778 --> 00:32:59.114
I haven't stepped down
from my position!

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.981
Stop complaining.

00:33:02.833 --> 00:33:04.750
You've been kicked
out of your position.

00:33:04.775 --> 00:33:05.901
Miss...

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:07.211
Fritzy.

00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:09.071
I don't care about your name.

00:33:09.822 --> 00:33:11.782
Maybe you're just not qualified.

00:33:14.201 --> 00:33:15.631
What are you doing?

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.394
How dare you!

00:33:23.419 --> 00:33:24.461
Stop them!

00:33:27.214 --> 00:33:29.175
Stop them!

00:33:47.324 --> 00:33:49.409
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:33:50.321 --> 00:33:52.406
You don’t have the right to hurt

00:33:52.615 --> 00:33:55.117
the Supreme Student Secretary!

00:33:55.534 --> 00:33:59.622
An insult to one of us
is an insult to all of us!

00:34:00.079 --> 00:34:02.099
Do I look like I care?

00:34:02.733 --> 00:34:04.902
Mark my words...

00:34:05.419 --> 00:34:10.299
I will use eveything in
my power to crush you.

00:34:10.674 --> 00:34:12.343
You won't be able to
escape my grudge.

00:34:13.135 --> 00:34:15.638
You can use all the power you have

00:34:16.263 --> 00:34:19.891
but it doesn't change the fact
that Fritzy is a bitch

00:34:19.892 --> 00:34:21.936
and you are an asshole.

00:34:41.455 --> 00:34:42.498
If you hit her...

00:34:42.957 --> 00:34:43.791
that would've been a third
warning for you

00:34:43.792 --> 00:34:45.376
and the former secretary

00:34:45.668 --> 00:34:48.128
Mr. President, my
sincerest apologies.

00:34:50.214 --> 00:34:51.757
I want this room cleared!

00:34:52.675 --> 00:34:54.009
On my command!

00:34:54.551 --> 00:34:55.551
One.

00:34:56.011 --> 00:34:57.971
President, if you would
let me explain

00:34:58.089 --> 00:35:00.049
it isn't Fritzy's fault.

00:35:00.099 --> 00:35:01.766
It was this good for nothing.

00:35:01.767 --> 00:35:02.726
It's this bitch who started-

00:35:02.727 --> 00:35:03.894
Two.

00:35:21.715 --> 00:35:23.091
Kill me now.

00:35:23.514 --> 00:35:25.057
Not yet, Ms. Shion.

00:35:25.167 --> 00:35:27.701
You need to heal before
you face your punishment, okay?

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.600
Cause you're the type of bitch
that’s qualified to be my secretary.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.092
So you need to be
treated immediately.

00:35:52.985 --> 00:35:54.451
Kill me now.

00:36:06.457 --> 00:36:07.458
Nurse Cha!

00:36:08.459 --> 00:36:09.543
Nurse Cha!

00:36:10.919 --> 00:36:11.919
Supremo...

00:36:12.921 --> 00:36:15.299
I don't want to see any
scars on her forehead.

00:36:17.509 --> 00:36:18.635
Let me check on her.

00:36:33.442 --> 00:36:35.944
I can't guarantee you
that it won't leave a scar.

00:36:37.279 --> 00:36:39.490
Well, you wouldn't let that
happen to my secretary.

00:36:40.199 --> 00:36:41.658
Right, Nurse Cha?

00:36:44.495 --> 00:36:45.537
Patch her up.

00:36:45.746 --> 00:36:46.746
Now.

00:36:47.206 --> 00:36:48.499
Yes, Supremo.

00:36:49.792 --> 00:36:53.316
Hey, I didn't agree
to that position yet.

00:37:18.821 --> 00:37:20.238
What happened to Zein?

00:37:20.239 --> 00:37:21.365
What happened to her?

00:37:25.536 --> 00:37:26.824
Oh my God, Zein!

00:37:27.246 --> 00:37:28.704
What did you get
yourself into this time

00:37:28.705 --> 00:37:31.208
that the SSG President
did that to you?

00:37:32.501 --> 00:37:34.097
President?

00:37:35.943 --> 00:37:37.695
The whole school's been
talking about it.

00:37:38.298 --> 00:37:40.759
Others said that the
President did this to you.

00:37:40.926 --> 00:37:42.469
A lot of people saw it, Zein.

00:37:45.431 --> 00:37:47.349
They're just making up stories.

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:49.768
Who would you believe?

00:37:50.185 --> 00:37:51.228
Me?

00:37:51.353 --> 00:37:52.354
Or other people?

00:38:03.857 --> 00:38:05.942
Onel was the one who pushed me

00:38:06.983 --> 00:38:09.383
because I got into a fight with
his bitch of a girlfriend.

00:38:10.122 --> 00:38:12.958
I knew it! You started
something again.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.628
Am I just going to let the queen
bee wannabees disrespect me?

00:38:16.653 --> 00:38:19.072
You have a point, we
hate those kind of girls.

00:38:21.489 --> 00:38:22.531
She started it...

00:38:23.177 --> 00:38:24.344
I finished it.

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:28.891
Isn't the plan to stay
away from trouble?

00:38:29.016 --> 00:38:31.059
I guess they didn't
get the memo.

00:38:32.728 --> 00:38:34.146
At least you're okay.

00:38:34.943 --> 00:38:35.943
I'm okay.

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:39.934
I didn't faint. I just fell asleep.

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.658
If the President didn't bring me here

00:38:46.783 --> 00:38:48.535
it could've been a lot worse.

00:38:55.292 --> 00:38:56.668
That made me hungry.

00:38:57.711 --> 00:38:59.671
Do you guys have snacks?

00:39:00.547 --> 00:39:02.216
I knew it.

00:39:07.304 --> 00:39:08.628
He's so sweet.

00:39:09.938 --> 00:39:11.898
It's a little cold.

00:39:12.843 --> 00:39:13.843
Thanks.

00:39:16.028 --> 00:39:17.363
Ms. Zein Shion...

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:27.740
What do you want?

00:39:27.798 --> 00:39:29.383
Do you want to fight again?

00:39:34.124 --> 00:39:35.124
Ms. Shion.

00:39:38.252 --> 00:39:39.378
What's happening?

00:39:40.546 --> 00:39:41.880
Ms. Zein Shion.

00:39:42.464 --> 00:39:45.342
I humbly ask for your forgiveness.

00:39:45.676 --> 00:39:47.480
I lost my mind for a bit.

00:39:48.136 --> 00:39:49.846
I didn't know what I was doing.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.644
Please forgive me.

00:39:54.434 --> 00:39:55.519
Oh my God.

00:39:58.021 --> 00:40:00.315
Public apology speed run?

00:40:02.276 --> 00:40:03.800
Please forgive me.

00:40:05.487 --> 00:40:06.589
Ms. Shion...

00:40:08.323 --> 00:40:09.783
Please.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.661
Ms. Shion, please!

00:40:13.976 --> 00:40:15.519
Forgive me!

00:40:16.299 --> 00:40:18.009
I'm not ready to die!

00:40:22.904 --> 00:40:23.904
Fine.

00:40:24.373 --> 00:40:25.666
Whatever.

00:40:26.124 --> 00:40:28.126
Stand up and leave.

00:40:29.469 --> 00:40:30.804
I want to eat in peace.

00:40:35.225 --> 00:40:36.435
Thank you...

00:40:37.281 --> 00:40:38.658
Thank you, Ms. Shion.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.321
Thank you.

00:40:44.325 --> 00:40:45.868
Let's go! Let's go!

00:40:53.011 --> 00:40:55.220
And why is the SSG Vice President

00:40:55.245 --> 00:40:57.683
begging for your forgiveness?

00:41:00.834 --> 00:41:02.210
Let's not think about it.

00:41:02.336 --> 00:41:03.879
I'm too hungry for that.

00:41:16.308 --> 00:41:17.434
Yum.

00:41:52.052 --> 00:41:55.430
Hi, good evening, how are
you? Take a mask please.

00:43:02.956 --> 00:43:06.418
This place finally feels
like a normal school.

00:43:06.543 --> 00:43:08.628
I think that's their intention

00:43:09.421 --> 00:43:12.048
to distract us from what's happening.

00:43:12.257 --> 00:43:14.176
So it's easier to control us.

00:43:14.426 --> 00:43:17.511
But it's not so bad to
have a little fun, right?

00:43:17.512 --> 00:43:18.721
You're right.

00:43:18.722 --> 00:43:19.722
Yeah, but don't forget

00:43:19.723 --> 00:43:23.435
we still have to take precautions.

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:24.825
Let’s stay here.

00:43:27.731 --> 00:43:29.291
I didn't it'll be a full house tonight.

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:30.900
Girls...

00:43:30.939 --> 00:43:32.065
stay close.

00:43:32.248 --> 00:43:33.624
Stay by our sides, okay?

00:43:36.147 --> 00:43:38.066
Even if it's Free Bloody Night

00:43:38.909 --> 00:43:41.203
we still can't trust them.

00:43:42.871 --> 00:43:45.207
Aw, our heroes.

00:43:45.506 --> 00:43:48.092
I'm still unsure why
Supremo isn't coming...

00:43:51.296 --> 00:43:52.839
What's with the commotion?

00:43:54.758 --> 00:43:56.051
What's up everyone!

00:44:01.284 --> 00:44:02.577
It's red hair!

00:44:23.056 --> 00:44:24.638
Is that Raze?

00:44:27.503 --> 00:44:28.504
Okay...

00:44:28.529 --> 00:44:29.863
that ruined the mood.

00:44:29.888 --> 00:44:31.806
So this is what their usual
parties look like?

00:44:32.737 --> 00:44:34.322
What more if it's a prom.

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:38.232
I hope we get to leave
before we see that.

00:44:38.579 --> 00:44:42.458
I don't even want to know
their gimmick for that.

00:44:43.098 --> 00:44:45.141
My mask is so itchy!

00:44:47.602 --> 00:44:48.728
But you know guys...

00:44:49.343 --> 00:44:51.011
I like costume parties.

00:44:52.163 --> 00:44:53.706
What if they choose
your costume?

00:44:54.609 --> 00:44:55.609
Pass!

00:45:05.453 --> 00:45:07.747
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen.

00:45:07.833 --> 00:45:09.251
My name is Fritzy.

00:45:09.383 --> 00:45:12.169
Your host for the night.

00:45:12.587 --> 00:45:15.006
A round of applause please!

00:45:18.466 --> 00:45:21.584
So many wonderful outfits
and looks tonight...

00:45:21.636 --> 00:45:23.096
I'm so happy!

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:27.302
It's giving mystery glam!

00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:29.351
Oh...

00:45:29.936 --> 00:45:31.104
I see.

00:45:31.354 --> 00:45:34.065
Even with these stylish
outfits provided

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:36.843
the newbies still look ugly.

00:45:37.152 --> 00:45:38.360
That’s okay,

00:45:38.361 --> 00:45:39.905
you're wearing masks.

00:45:40.133 --> 00:45:42.051
No need to be ashamed.

00:45:42.949 --> 00:45:44.117
Anyway.

00:45:44.993 --> 00:45:46.953
Let's get this party started

00:45:47.126 --> 00:45:49.958
by welcoming the guests of honor.

00:45:50.114 --> 00:45:53.138
The administration
of Hell University.

00:45:53.381 --> 00:45:54.465
First up

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:57.379
the head of the Supreme
Student Government

00:45:57.522 --> 00:45:59.107
SSG advisor.

00:45:59.132 --> 00:46:01.384
Ms. Katherine Velasquez.

00:46:07.182 --> 00:46:08.433
Next stop!

00:46:09.184 --> 00:46:11.728
The Vice President
of Hell University.

00:46:12.187 --> 00:46:14.606
You know him as the creator
of The Bloody Night

00:46:15.941 --> 00:46:18.777
also known as Freedom Night.

00:46:19.611 --> 00:46:21.863
Please give a warm welcome

00:46:21.973 --> 00:46:24.475
Mr. Francisco Agustin.

00:46:28.286 --> 00:46:29.286
It can't be.

00:46:30.673 --> 00:46:31.673
What the...

00:46:32.415 --> 00:46:34.333
the old man is part of the admin?

00:46:34.334 --> 00:46:35.919
That bastard!

00:46:36.127 --> 00:46:37.963
Thought he was just a caretaker.

00:46:38.546 --> 00:46:40.548
They played us like a fiddle.

00:46:40.822 --> 00:46:41.823
Crazy.

00:46:41.848 --> 00:46:42.536
Now...

00:46:42.561 --> 00:46:43.810
Let me ask you.

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:45.720
Are you ready Hell U?

00:46:47.693 --> 00:46:50.083
I said, are you ready!?

00:46:53.507 --> 00:46:56.009
Last but definitely not the least,

00:46:56.386 --> 00:47:00.575
your favorite and mine,
Madam Violet Rivera!

00:47:15.625 --> 00:47:19.671
Thank you for that very
spirited introduction, Fritzy.

00:47:20.588 --> 00:47:23.466
I'm overjoyed to see each
and every one of you.

00:47:23.925 --> 00:47:25.467
But I won't make this speech long

00:47:25.468 --> 00:47:28.138
cause I know you're
all ready to party.

00:47:29.889 --> 00:47:31.182
Students...

00:47:32.058 --> 00:47:33.727
estemeed guests.

00:47:34.936 --> 00:47:36.562
By the power vested in me

00:47:36.563 --> 00:47:39.065
as the headmistress of Hell University

00:47:39.399 --> 00:47:43.873
I declare that now is the official start

00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:47.106
of this year's
acquaintance party.

00:47:52.996 --> 00:47:55.348
Please enjoy the night.

00:48:16.411 --> 00:48:17.411
Cheers!

00:48:17.854 --> 00:48:18.982
Cheers!

00:48:24.886 --> 00:48:26.387
Good evening, Ms. Shion.

00:48:28.144 --> 00:48:29.354
Vice President,

00:48:29.412 --> 00:48:31.205
what pleasure do I owe you?

00:48:31.554 --> 00:48:34.223
I haven't congratulated
you formally.

00:48:34.489 --> 00:48:35.908
For being the new.

00:48:36.103 --> 00:48:39.481
Supreme Student
Government Secretary.

00:48:40.151 --> 00:48:42.320
Am I supposed to
be happy about that?

00:48:44.166 --> 00:48:47.044
Just give it to the one
that's thirsty for that position.

00:48:47.607 --> 00:48:49.651
It's the Supremo's decision,

00:48:49.877 --> 00:48:51.462
his orders are absolute.

00:48:51.712 --> 00:48:53.631
You have no choice.

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:56.441
I have no choice either.

00:48:57.811 --> 00:48:59.270
Be happy, Ms. Shion.

00:48:59.295 --> 00:49:02.590
Supremo's really particular
in choosing his secretary.

00:49:03.483 --> 00:49:05.485
Because of that position

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:09.656
you quickly climbed to the ninth rank.

00:49:10.782 --> 00:49:11.802
What?

00:49:13.583 --> 00:49:15.043
I'll take my leave then.

00:49:16.237 --> 00:49:17.988
Congrats again, Ms. Shion.

00:49:19.334 --> 00:49:20.669
Oh my god!

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:22.683
That's so fast!

00:49:22.961 --> 00:49:24.671
Rank nine!?

00:49:24.696 --> 00:49:26.614
And the secretary too?

00:49:26.769 --> 00:49:29.396
Whatever curse you have,
can I have some of it?

00:49:29.868 --> 00:49:31.244
Your luck is overflowing!

00:49:31.525 --> 00:49:33.235
You can leave this place, Zein!

00:49:34.764 --> 00:49:36.558
And rank nine...

00:49:37.225 --> 00:49:39.560
of all the ranks you've received

00:49:39.561 --> 00:49:41.646
that's the highest you've achieved.

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.355
Congrats, Zein!

00:49:43.356 --> 00:49:44.481
That's our girl!

00:49:44.482 --> 00:49:45.482
Cheers!

00:49:47.193 --> 00:49:48.193
Cheers!

00:49:49.237 --> 00:49:50.280
Zein!

00:49:56.369 --> 00:49:57.537
Zein...

00:49:58.079 --> 00:50:00.123
don't accept that position.

00:50:01.166 --> 00:50:03.710
Don't forget, this
is still Hell University.

00:50:03.918 --> 00:50:05.837
Everything here has
consequences.

00:50:06.087 --> 00:50:07.547
Calm down, Matt.

00:50:08.844 --> 00:50:10.971
Let Zein decide for herself.

00:50:11.136 --> 00:50:13.263
It's her choice, remember?

00:50:14.888 --> 00:50:15.930
Dave's right, Matt.

00:50:16.135 --> 00:50:17.375
Let Zein make her own decision.

00:50:18.028 --> 00:50:19.947
Let her leave this hell.

00:50:20.435 --> 00:50:22.896
And she can get help
from the outside.

00:50:26.191 --> 00:50:29.777
Are you going to accept
the position, Zein?

00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:42.332
That girl!

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:45.167
I'll think about it.

00:50:45.573 --> 00:50:46.573
Excuse me.

00:50:46.796 --> 00:50:48.256
Zein!

00:51:37.704 --> 00:51:39.123
Is it the promotion?

00:51:40.473 --> 00:51:42.267
Bad idea if you ask me.

00:51:44.394 --> 00:51:48.189
You have to hold a knife
if you accept that position.

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.484
You should've been dead by now

00:51:51.609 --> 00:51:53.778
if he wasn't keen on protecting you.

00:51:55.697 --> 00:51:59.117
But he can't protect you forever.

00:52:01.327 --> 00:52:05.290
Hold the knife, Zein. Before it's too late.

00:52:12.403 --> 00:52:13.947
Who are you?

00:52:14.205 --> 00:52:15.706
Who are you?

00:52:16.501 --> 00:52:19.380
- Answer me!
- Miss, take it easy!

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:22.071
Sorry...

00:52:27.926 --> 00:52:29.134
Did you find Zein?

00:52:29.174 --> 00:52:30.550
It's too dark outside

00:52:30.815 --> 00:52:32.275
and everyone's wearing masks.

00:52:32.608 --> 00:52:34.527
I almost got lost.

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.529
Matt, this is your fault!

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:39.907
You should've have pressured her.

00:52:40.033 --> 00:52:43.828
Aren't you curious why she got
that position so easily?

00:52:43.967 --> 00:52:44.635
What?

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:46.287
It's a little too convenient

00:52:47.206 --> 00:52:49.098
- don't you think?
- What do you mean?

00:52:50.043 --> 00:52:53.546
Why does it seem like you
don't want us to be happy for Zein?

00:52:53.571 --> 00:52:56.324
That's not my intentions,
I'm just worried for her!

00:53:03.096 --> 00:53:03.764
- Oh my God!
- Dave!

00:53:03.789 --> 00:53:04.289
Shit!

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:05.481
- Bro, are you okay?
- Dave!

00:53:06.517 --> 00:53:07.852
Shit!

00:53:10.701 --> 00:53:13.450
Since when did Dave's tolerance
for alcohol get so low?

00:53:14.632 --> 00:53:15.632
Dave...

00:53:16.396 --> 00:53:19.297
Shit, let's bring him to the clinic!

00:53:19.322 --> 00:53:20.323
Dave, are ou okay?!

00:53:20.677 --> 00:53:21.845
Zein...

00:53:22.867 --> 00:53:24.160
Zein!

00:53:25.363 --> 00:53:28.473
Matt, help me! He's in a bad shape.

00:53:29.925 --> 00:53:30.925
Shit!

00:53:31.437 --> 00:53:32.692
Where did Matt go?

00:53:33.486 --> 00:53:34.111
Where is he?

00:53:34.136 --> 00:53:35.178
Zein!

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:37.465
They drank the same thing.

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:38.560
Fuck!

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:44.305
Dave, wake up!

00:53:44.362 --> 00:53:45.362
Dave!

00:55:13.811 --> 00:55:14.811
Zein?

00:55:16.814 --> 00:55:17.814
Zein...

00:55:19.734 --> 00:55:20.734
What happened?

00:55:21.235 --> 00:55:22.235
Zein?

00:55:29.785 --> 00:55:32.872
Help, please!

00:55:43.132 --> 00:55:46.092
Their drink was compromised
by an illegal drug.

00:55:46.093 --> 00:55:48.762
They drank a high dosage,
that's why they're like this.

00:55:48.763 --> 00:55:49.847
Zein...

00:55:50.822 --> 00:55:52.783
Can't you see she's
literally dying already!?

00:55:52.808 --> 00:55:54.227
Let's wait for the doctor.

00:55:54.852 --> 00:55:55.937
Excuse me.

00:55:56.222 --> 00:55:57.932
Whoever did this,

00:55:58.294 --> 00:56:00.791
I swear I won't forgive him.

00:56:00.816 --> 00:56:02.585
She needs to be treated right away

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:04.987
but nobody seems to care
in this goddamn place!

00:56:05.012 --> 00:56:09.068
Aren't you happy that there
will be no bloodshed tonight?

00:56:10.863 --> 00:56:13.023
What about what happned earlier,
what do you call that?
