WEBVTT

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.880
- Go, Via!
- Let’s go, go, go.

00:00:26.904 --> 00:00:28.364
Hit that ball, Via!

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:37.077
Hi, Arkin.

00:00:37.102 --> 00:00:39.339
Such a heartthrob.

00:00:39.808 --> 00:00:40.851
I am good-looking.

00:00:40.976 --> 00:00:43.186
Kino, do you have a crush?

00:00:43.662 --> 00:00:44.705
We won!

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:46.481
Hey, Yanna!

00:00:46.523 --> 00:00:48.166
We won! We won!

00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:48.750
Yeah!

00:00:48.775 --> 00:00:50.444
Well, congratulations.

00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:52.975
Hey, you’re joining the
Miss Valerian pageant.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.281
You don’t have a choice
anymore, I signed you up.

00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:57.826
So, today we’re officially
kicking off our Foundation Week.

00:00:58.125 --> 00:00:59.919
A slut, huh?

00:01:02.414 --> 00:01:06.460
Yanna, don’t ever think there’s
something wrong with you, okay?

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.003
You didn’t do anything wrong.

00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:09.796
You didn’t do anything bad.

00:01:10.923 --> 00:01:11.632
Here you go.

00:01:11.632 --> 00:01:14.468
If anyone wants to sign up
for the marriage booth.

00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:16.595
Excuse me, can I sign up?

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:17.654
Huh?

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:18.822
Via?

00:01:18.847 --> 00:01:19.906
Huh?

00:01:22.696 --> 00:01:23.804
Let’s get married.

00:02:38.093 --> 00:02:39.093
Huh?

00:02:40.512 --> 00:02:41.888
Why would we get married?

00:02:43.172 --> 00:02:44.632
So ’til death do us part.

00:02:44.808 --> 00:02:46.268
Didn’t you say we’d never leave each other?

00:02:46.853 --> 00:02:48.912
And look, I even prepared a ring.

00:02:48.937 --> 00:02:50.117
See?

00:02:52.377 --> 00:02:54.004
There’s no need.

00:02:57.154 --> 00:02:59.197
You don’t want to marry me, Via?

00:03:00.741 --> 00:03:04.786
What I mean is, we
don’t need to get married

00:03:04.786 --> 00:03:06.955
just to prove we won’t
leave each other, right?

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.641
What if someone signs you up
and you marry someone else?

00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:13.603
No one’s gonna sign me up.

00:03:13.628 --> 00:03:15.839
Then what if someone signs me up?

00:03:15.982 --> 00:03:18.108
I mean, what if someone else signs us up

00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:19.593
and we suddenly get caught and then—

00:03:19.818 --> 00:03:21.069
Then you’d marry
someone else and

00:03:21.094 --> 00:03:22.929
and I’d marry someone
else, and then it’s like—

00:03:23.113 --> 00:03:24.323
Hush!

00:03:24.441 --> 00:03:25.651
Okay, okay.

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:27.284
Fine.

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:28.560
Let’s get married.

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:34.900
You… You’re really marrying me, Via?

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.501
- Yeah.
- All right.

00:03:36.526 --> 00:03:37.319
I mean, I can take it back—

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.403
No, no, don’t.

00:03:38.403 --> 00:03:39.507
Let’s get married.

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:47.621
We’re getting married.

00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:51.958
Arkin, take a picture of us.

00:03:52.584 --> 00:03:53.960
You’re ruining the moment.

00:03:55.337 --> 00:03:56.588
Why do you want a picture?

00:03:56.797 --> 00:03:58.590
Sevi, you’re so annoying.

00:03:59.216 --> 00:04:00.008
Fine, whatever.

00:04:00.008 --> 00:04:00.842
- Okay, say cheese.
- Wait.

00:04:00.842 --> 00:04:01.343
Are we in it too? Oh, okay.

00:04:01.343 --> 00:04:04.721
It’s fine, right?
This is just for fun anyway.

00:04:04.937 --> 00:04:05.972
All right—

00:04:13.355 --> 00:04:14.397
Let’s go!

00:04:14.397 --> 00:04:14.981
- Kino, what the—
- Ouch!

00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:16.597
Where are you taking me?

00:04:16.858 --> 00:04:18.183
We’re getting married, aren’t we?

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.336
Right now?

00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:20.462
Yes, right now.

00:04:20.487 --> 00:04:21.488
Come on, MUMU.

00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:23.281
MUMU?

00:04:23.657 --> 00:04:24.800
MUMU.

00:04:24.825 --> 00:04:28.316
My Universe. My Unending.

00:04:30.387 --> 00:04:32.181
Huh? Don’t even. That’s so cringey.

00:04:32.206 --> 00:04:34.150
No way! It’s like calling me a ghost.

00:04:34.175 --> 00:04:36.128
I’m just kidding. I just read it online.

00:04:36.128 --> 00:04:36.920
Well? Come on.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.838
Let’s go!

00:04:37.838 --> 00:04:39.256
Huh? What?

00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:40.549
Excuse me.

00:04:40.549 --> 00:04:41.800
- Excuse me.
- Kino, what are you—

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.551
Excuse me.

00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:43.552
- Excuse me.
- Hey, you’re too loud.

00:04:43.552 --> 00:04:44.094
Excuse me.

00:04:44.094 --> 00:04:45.554
Excuse me.

00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:47.389
- Sir, there’s a line.
- I’m sorry.

00:04:47.414 --> 00:04:49.324
- Sir, there’s a line.
- I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:50.605
We’re getting married.

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:52.769
Who’s being nominated?

00:04:53.228 --> 00:04:54.646
We're both volunteers.

00:04:54.896 --> 00:04:56.064
Volunteers?

00:04:56.314 --> 00:04:57.925
What is this, a blood donation?

00:04:58.483 --> 00:05:01.227
We’re surrendering so you
don’t have to arrest us anymore.

00:05:01.252 --> 00:05:02.295
Sir…

00:05:03.113 --> 00:05:04.781
Can you read?

00:05:05.994 --> 00:05:08.818
All right then, I’m nominating Via.

00:05:08.843 --> 00:05:10.206
Avianna Diaz.

00:05:11.663 --> 00:05:15.667
Sorry, but nominations are
already closed for today.

00:05:16.126 --> 00:05:17.711
But—

00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:21.339
Maybe I can put Madam Via’s
name down tomorrow.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.383
For tomorrow.

00:05:23.383 --> 00:05:24.384
Tomorrow?

00:05:24.384 --> 00:05:25.468
Yeah, tomorrow.

00:05:26.386 --> 00:05:27.888
Maybe you can slip us in,

00:05:27.888 --> 00:05:29.681
‘cause she might change her mind tomorrow.

00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:31.308
Please, just let us in. Please.

00:05:31.308 --> 00:05:33.226
- Kino, stand up.
- Please, sir.

00:05:33.226 --> 00:05:34.895
- I’m sorry about this.
- All right, fine.

00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:36.730
On one condition.

00:05:36.897 --> 00:05:39.566
You need to talk to the others
who signed up first—

00:05:39.566 --> 00:05:40.650
Hey!

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.193
Maybe you guys can—

00:05:41.193 --> 00:05:42.485
Come on, can we go first, please?

00:05:42.485 --> 00:05:44.112
Please? Just do it tomorrow instead.

00:05:44.112 --> 00:05:45.947
I don’t want her to change her mind.

00:05:45.947 --> 00:05:48.408
Please? Just do it tomorrow
Don’t get married today.

00:05:48.408 --> 00:05:51.161
He really wants to get married, huh.

00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:52.287
What do you want in return?
Want some snacks?

00:05:52.287 --> 00:05:53.914
I’ll treat you.

00:05:53.914 --> 00:05:55.123
Alright.

00:05:55.123 --> 00:05:56.208
Okay? Thank you.

00:05:56.208 --> 00:05:58.210
Just head over to the other booths first.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.169
There’s also a Pop the Balloon over there.

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:00.545
Thanks a lot. Thank you.

00:06:02.464 --> 00:06:04.758
All right, the altar’s ready. Let’s go.

00:06:08.345 --> 00:06:10.263
You’re the officiant?

00:06:10.263 --> 00:06:11.890
You don’t want me to?

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.016
I do, Father.

00:06:13.892 --> 00:06:14.935
There she is.

00:07:52.776 --> 00:07:56.446
Larkin Olivier Sanchez,

00:07:56.494 --> 00:07:58.788
do you take Avianna—

00:07:58.788 --> 00:07:59.706
I do!

00:07:59.706 --> 00:08:01.207
- I do.
- Do it later—

00:08:01.207 --> 00:08:03.501
Well, it’s your wedding anyway. Okay.

00:08:05.211 --> 00:08:07.739
Avianna, do you take

00:08:09.215 --> 00:08:11.509
Larkin Olivier Sanchez

00:08:12.093 --> 00:08:17.057
as your lawfully wedded husband?

00:08:28.026 --> 00:08:29.052
I do.

00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:32.098
Okay.

00:08:34.497 --> 00:08:36.743
Wait, wait.

00:08:36.768 --> 00:08:37.844
Wait a minute, please.

00:08:37.869 --> 00:08:40.163
- Wait, Father.
- What’s that, a prop?

00:08:41.591 --> 00:08:42.832
I never thought of that.

00:08:46.129 --> 00:08:47.589
There you go.

00:08:50.048 --> 00:08:51.274
Okay.

00:08:51.502 --> 00:08:53.796
- So, at least with that—
- Wait, Father!

00:08:55.095 --> 00:08:56.161
One more.

00:08:58.723 --> 00:09:03.770
To my best friend Via, you know
that ever since we were kids—

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.688
Sir, I still have a lot of
weddings to officiate.

00:09:05.688 --> 00:09:06.981
- Let’s keep it short.
- Okay, Father.

00:09:06.981 --> 00:09:07.899
- Is that alright?
- Sure.

00:09:07.899 --> 00:09:09.651
All right.

00:09:09.984 --> 00:09:14.030
I now pronounce you, husband and wife.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.484
You may now kiss the bride.

00:09:35.176 --> 00:09:36.636
We’re married!

00:09:36.636 --> 00:09:38.680
We’re married!

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.848
We’re married now.

00:09:39.848 --> 00:09:41.808
We’re married, Via!

00:09:43.143 --> 00:09:44.269
Show them your ring.

00:09:46.184 --> 00:09:47.939
Okay, here—

00:09:47.939 --> 00:09:49.649
That’s your certificate,

00:09:49.649 --> 00:09:52.068
and I’ll just take this
for the next couple.

00:09:52.068 --> 00:09:53.778
- I’m sorry.
- Okay, there.

00:09:53.778 --> 00:09:54.904
- All right, next please!
- Wait, this too.

00:09:54.904 --> 00:09:55.572
Next, okay—

00:09:55.572 --> 00:09:56.614
She’s your crush, right?

00:09:56.614 --> 00:09:58.032
She’s not my crush.

00:09:58.032 --> 00:09:59.451
Then who is your crush?

00:09:59.451 --> 00:10:00.827
Come on, I’ll help you, hurry.

00:10:00.827 --> 00:10:03.246
Hey, everyone! Look!
Via and I just got married!

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:05.688
- Hey, it’s all just pretend, Kino.
- Let me see.

00:10:05.713 --> 00:10:07.298
This is fake.

00:10:07.323 --> 00:10:08.741
Fake? That’s legit! It even has signatures.

00:10:08.766 --> 00:10:10.435
- Can I see? I wanna see.
- There are witnesses too.

00:10:10.462 --> 00:10:11.588
Here, look.

00:10:11.588 --> 00:10:12.922
Via, Arkin tricked you, didn’t he?

00:10:12.922 --> 00:10:15.528
Want me to suggest an
Annulment Booth to the president?

00:10:15.838 --> 00:10:18.258
Annulment, my foot.
You’re just jealous, dude!

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.472
- Okay, guys! Shut up!
- Congratulations!

00:10:20.472 --> 00:10:22.515
I think we’re ready for
all the parlor games,

00:10:22.515 --> 00:10:24.392
but no one’s allowed to back out or

00:10:24.392 --> 00:10:26.060
we’ll be short on players.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.228
Okay? Got it?

00:10:27.228 --> 00:10:28.271
Why, what’s the plan?

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.944
Three, two, one—

00:10:34.944 --> 00:10:36.160
Go!

00:10:40.783 --> 00:10:42.118
- Sam!
- Go, Sam!

00:10:42.785 --> 00:10:43.995
Yanna, hurry!

00:10:44.245 --> 00:10:45.346
Hurry up!

00:10:45.371 --> 00:10:46.206
One foot at a time!

00:10:46.206 --> 00:10:48.958
One, two—

00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:49.959
I’m sorry, okay.

00:10:49.959 --> 00:10:51.628
- One, two—
- One, two—

00:10:51.669 --> 00:10:53.588
One, two—

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.298
- One, two—
- One, two—

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.342
- One, two—
- One, two—

00:10:59.302 --> 00:11:00.053
Via!

00:11:00.053 --> 00:11:00.720
Are you okay?

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.430
Arkin, come on!
Faster!

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.892
- One, two—
- One, two—

00:11:05.892 --> 00:11:07.810
One, two—

00:11:09.771 --> 00:11:12.106
Let’s go, guys! Let’s go!

00:11:12.106 --> 00:11:13.483
Kino!

00:11:13.942 --> 00:11:15.109
- One, two—
- One, two—

00:11:15.109 --> 00:11:16.294
Via—

00:11:16.319 --> 00:11:18.613
Hurry! Hurry!

00:11:18.905 --> 00:11:20.823
Hurry!

00:11:21.199 --> 00:11:22.367
- One, two—
- One, two—

00:11:25.495 --> 00:11:27.080
Yes!

00:11:28.748 --> 00:11:31.167
I told you to focus!

00:11:32.293 --> 00:11:33.545
Good job, Via!

00:11:35.088 --> 00:11:36.277
And this—

00:11:36.598 --> 00:11:38.620
You’re always getting hurt.

00:11:38.645 --> 00:11:40.401
If this keeps up,
I’m keeping you in my pocket.

00:11:40.426 --> 00:11:42.428
You’re overreacting. I’m fine.

00:11:42.428 --> 00:11:43.429
It doesn’t even hurt.

00:11:43.429 --> 00:11:45.223
Still, it might get infected.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.809
Here, put a band-aid on it.

00:11:48.935 --> 00:11:50.478
I said it’s fine.

00:11:51.145 --> 00:11:52.647
Stop worrying so much.

00:11:53.898 --> 00:11:55.400
Stop worrying?

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:56.488
I haven’t placed it yet.

00:11:56.513 --> 00:11:58.097
Don’t press on it.

00:11:58.152 --> 00:11:59.688
I’m just about to put it.

00:11:59.713 --> 00:12:01.631
See?

00:12:01.656 --> 00:12:02.574
All right, it’s fine.

00:12:02.574 --> 00:12:04.492
Don’t touch it anymore. It’s fine.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.206
Via—

00:12:06.327 --> 00:12:07.078
Water?

00:12:07.078 --> 00:12:07.699
Oh.

00:12:08.788 --> 00:12:09.372
Thanks, Pres.

00:12:09.372 --> 00:12:10.456
You know, that’ll heal in no time.

00:12:10.456 --> 00:12:13.496
And by the way, you did
an amazing job earlier.

00:12:15.753 --> 00:12:16.777
You too.

00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:20.692
So—

00:12:20.717 --> 00:12:22.927
- Okay, don’t touch it anymore.
- Okay, guys!

00:12:23.219 --> 00:12:25.305
Are you guys ready for the next game?

00:12:25.305 --> 00:12:27.457
What now? My feet are killing me.

00:12:27.482 --> 00:12:29.025
Via’s hurt, you know?

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.678
You were all so happy earlier,
and now you’re acting like this.

00:12:31.703 --> 00:12:33.288
- You should be the one playing.
- Can’t we rest?

00:12:33.313 --> 00:12:36.065
Nope, no resting allowed.

00:12:36.274 --> 00:12:37.191
Okay, guys!

00:12:37.191 --> 00:12:39.836
Our next game is Pass the Paper.

00:12:39.861 --> 00:12:40.903
- Jeez.
- Okay?

00:12:40.903 --> 00:12:43.781
So here’s how it goes,
you’ll pass this piece of paper

00:12:43.781 --> 00:12:45.783
from the first member to the last member.

00:12:45.783 --> 00:12:49.037
Using any body part.

00:12:49.245 --> 00:12:50.430
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:12:50.455 --> 00:12:53.683
Anyway, you can’t use your hands, got it?

00:12:53.708 --> 00:12:54.334
Yes!

00:12:54.334 --> 00:12:57.962
So, the first team to
hand me five papers wins.

00:13:00.548 --> 00:13:01.966
Let’s just use our mouths.

00:13:02.091 --> 00:13:03.582
- That’ll be faster.
- What if it falls?

00:13:03.607 --> 00:13:04.636
Then you’re an idiot.

00:13:04.636 --> 00:13:05.720
All right, mouths it is.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.596
Mouths then.

00:13:06.596 --> 00:13:09.223
Can’t we use our toes or something?

00:13:09.223 --> 00:13:11.100
That’s gross. Let’s just use our mouth.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.477
Let’s go with that.

00:13:12.477 --> 00:13:14.937
Ready? Three, two, one, go!

00:13:16.025 --> 00:13:16.939
Hurry up!

00:13:16.939 --> 00:13:18.316
- Faster! Hurry!
- Let’s go, let’s go!

00:13:18.316 --> 00:13:19.192
Come on!

00:13:19.192 --> 00:13:20.401
We got this! Let’s go!

00:13:20.652 --> 00:13:21.892
- Okay.
- Come on, hurry!

00:13:27.367 --> 00:13:28.063
Oh my—

00:13:28.088 --> 00:13:29.297
- Jerk!
- Fucker!

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:30.912
You bastard!
That was my first kiss!

00:13:30.912 --> 00:13:32.121
What? That was my first kiss too!

00:13:32.121 --> 00:13:34.290
Who dropped the paper?
Was it me?

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:35.124
Disgusting!

00:13:35.124 --> 00:13:37.210
Hey! You’re disgusting!

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:38.628
You even leaned in!

00:13:38.628 --> 00:13:39.711
You even looked excited!

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:40.463
Huh?

00:13:40.463 --> 00:13:41.756
Who’s an idiot now?

00:13:41.756 --> 00:13:43.132
You’re the one who dropped the paper—

00:13:43.925 --> 00:13:45.593
You probably like me, huh?

00:13:45.593 --> 00:13:47.261
- You did it on purpose, didn’t you?
- What?

00:13:47.286 --> 00:13:48.571
As if I’d like you.

00:13:48.596 --> 00:13:51.224
Everything about you, seriously, so gross!

00:13:52.308 --> 00:13:53.309
I can’t believe—

00:13:53.968 --> 00:13:55.240
Ew!

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:59.065
Your kiss looked like it
was in slow motion, like this.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.317
Well, maybe you two are
really meant for each other.

00:14:01.317 --> 00:14:02.944
Kino, stop it!

00:14:02.944 --> 00:14:03.778
Yanna, it’s fine.

00:14:03.778 --> 00:14:05.530
At least you’ve had your first kiss now!

00:14:08.199 --> 00:14:13.037
My dream first kiss was supposed to be
with someone handsome, kind, tall.

00:14:13.037 --> 00:14:14.539
My type!

00:14:14.997 --> 00:14:17.517
Someone who’d love me forever.

00:14:17.542 --> 00:14:18.876
Not someone who...

00:14:18.876 --> 00:14:20.169
looks like a ladle!

00:14:20.169 --> 00:14:23.256
I was expecting paper, and you
gave me a kiss instead.

00:14:23.256 --> 00:14:24.757
This is your fault!
You’re disgusting!

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:28.654
- A ladle!
- Disgusting!

00:14:28.685 --> 00:14:30.099
- You guys are the worst!
- What?

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.931
I’m not hanging out
with you all ever again!

00:14:32.265 --> 00:14:33.891
All you do is torture me.

00:14:34.083 --> 00:14:35.251
Gross!

00:14:36.184 --> 00:14:38.529
- Yanna!
- Apparently, you look like a ladle!

00:14:38.563 --> 00:14:40.990
Let me see? Let me see that ladle face.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:47.864
Wow.

00:14:48.406 --> 00:14:50.286
My wifey’s so talented.

00:14:51.325 --> 00:14:53.578
Wifey? I’m not your wife.

00:14:53.578 --> 00:14:55.329
Don’t call me wifey, Kino.

00:14:55.383 --> 00:14:57.719
All right then, how about MUMU!

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.891
What?

00:14:58.916 --> 00:15:00.752
My Universe and—

00:15:02.128 --> 00:15:05.106
That’s it.
There’s not going to be a next time.

00:15:05.131 --> 00:15:06.318
I’m kidding!

00:15:07.717 --> 00:15:08.966
You don’t like MUMU?

00:15:10.161 --> 00:15:10.803
Via?

00:15:10.803 --> 00:15:11.919
- Pa!
- Pa.

00:15:12.555 --> 00:15:13.677
Hello.

00:15:15.641 --> 00:15:16.809
How are you guys?

00:15:17.226 --> 00:15:18.770
Are you okay, Pa?

00:15:19.437 --> 00:15:20.490
I’m fine.

00:15:21.063 --> 00:15:23.107
Wait, I have something to show you.

00:15:23.316 --> 00:15:24.817
- What’s that?
- Here.

00:15:25.151 --> 00:15:26.235
Via and I got married.

00:15:26.235 --> 00:15:27.069
Too bad you weren’t there.

00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:27.862
Look.

00:15:27.862 --> 00:15:29.363
Arkin and Via.

00:15:29.388 --> 00:15:30.597
Marriage certificate.

00:15:30.973 --> 00:15:32.308
So, where’s the ring?

00:15:33.534 --> 00:15:35.470
I already ate it. You want some?

00:15:35.495 --> 00:15:37.013
There’s still one left here.

00:15:37.038 --> 00:15:38.414
But it just lights up like this.

00:15:38.706 --> 00:15:39.749
Kino!

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.084
You guys are such goofballs.

00:15:42.418 --> 00:15:44.003
How’s your studies?

00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:47.507
It’s our foundation week right now,
Pa, so no classes.

00:15:47.507 --> 00:15:48.925
Foundation week, I see.

00:15:49.133 --> 00:15:50.718
Do you have any new friends?

00:15:51.511 --> 00:15:54.472
You know, dear, I’m a bit worried because

00:15:54.472 --> 00:15:57.475
the only person you ever talk to is Arkin.

00:15:58.392 --> 00:16:01.646
You two can’t be together forever.

00:16:01.646 --> 00:16:04.106
What if you go to different colleges?

00:16:04.607 --> 00:16:08.294
Pa, I do have friends.

00:16:08.319 --> 00:16:09.070
Really?

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.798
Yes. Next time, if it’s okay,
I’ll introduce them to you.

00:16:11.823 --> 00:16:14.283
Then bring them here, invite them over
so I can meet them.

00:16:14.659 --> 00:16:16.577
Here, Pa. I’ll show you.

00:16:17.662 --> 00:16:18.704
Here.

00:16:18.704 --> 00:16:20.832
This is Luna, and this is Kierra.

00:16:20.832 --> 00:16:22.834
- These are her new friends.
- I see.

00:16:23.292 --> 00:16:25.503
You should invite them
over so I can meet them,

00:16:25.503 --> 00:16:27.296
and I’ll prepare some
food for them too.

00:16:28.506 --> 00:16:30.716
By the way, Via, did Mira
mention anything to you

00:16:30.716 --> 00:16:33.803
about the art materials
she needs for school?

00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:36.591
Huh? I don’t think she said anything, Pa.

00:16:38.391 --> 00:16:39.392
Does she need it now?

00:16:39.392 --> 00:16:41.227
The store might be… what time is it now?

00:16:41.227 --> 00:16:43.104
- The stores might be closed—
- I’ll go. I’ll take care of it.

00:16:43.104 --> 00:16:45.064
I know a place that’s
open 24/7. It’s nearby.

00:16:45.712 --> 00:16:48.715
The one you know is near the school.
That’s far from here.

00:16:49.151 --> 00:16:51.946
Don’t worry about it. I
got this. Husband duties.

00:16:54.323 --> 00:16:55.356
Wifey.

00:16:56.672 --> 00:16:58.879
All right, I’ll go ahead.

00:16:59.787 --> 00:17:00.997
Get some rest, Pa.

00:17:00.997 --> 00:17:02.957
Pa, make sure you rest well.

00:17:03.499 --> 00:17:04.834
All right, sweetheart.

00:17:04.834 --> 00:17:06.114
Listen to your child.

00:17:06.139 --> 00:17:08.308
Yes, sweetheart. Thank you.

00:17:09.976 --> 00:17:14.189
I’m glad that you’re always ready to help,
even for my siblings.

00:17:16.929 --> 00:17:18.097
I should finish this up now.

00:17:18.183 --> 00:17:19.490
Hey…

00:17:19.515 --> 00:17:20.975
What if I call you “honey” instead?

00:17:20.975 --> 00:17:22.143
Wait, let me just finish this.

00:17:22.143 --> 00:17:23.731
You don’t like to be called “honey”?

00:17:24.395 --> 00:17:26.856
I’ll call you like, “Hon,
where’s my breakfast?”

00:17:26.856 --> 00:17:28.403
- That’s how I’ll do it.
- Whatever!

00:17:30.526 --> 00:17:31.669
Here!

00:17:31.694 --> 00:17:32.945
Here’s your blanket.

00:17:33.446 --> 00:17:36.157
You always pull mine
whenever you sleep over.

00:17:36.449 --> 00:17:37.700
Is that how you hand someone a blanket?

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.118
By throwing it at their face?

00:17:39.427 --> 00:17:41.012
Fine, give it back then.
Don’t use a blanket.

00:17:41.037 --> 00:17:42.129
No, give it to me.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.372
No, you don’t need it anymore.

00:17:43.372 --> 00:17:44.582
You already gave it to me.

00:17:44.582 --> 00:17:46.000
It’s fine, I don’t mind.
I’ll use it instead.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.376
No, give it to me. It gets cold at night

00:17:47.376 --> 00:17:49.944
and you always point the fan at me.

00:17:49.969 --> 00:17:51.137
Try not to use a blanket this time.

00:17:52.089 --> 00:17:54.884
Arkin, thank you for the art papers.

00:17:55.134 --> 00:17:57.903
No problem. And what do I always say?

00:17:58.279 --> 00:17:59.864
If big bro can do it—

00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:02.308
- No problemo!
- No problemo.

00:18:03.434 --> 00:18:04.827
Good night.

00:18:04.852 --> 00:18:05.937
- Good night!
- Good night.

00:18:05.937 --> 00:18:07.396
All right, go to sleep, okay? Good night.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.215
Come on.

00:18:29.627 --> 00:18:30.920
Why are you laughing?

00:18:33.089 --> 00:18:36.801
I just remembered Sevi
and Yanna’s kiss earlier.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.872
They looked like magnets.

00:18:42.139 --> 00:18:45.476
That’s exactly why Yanna doesn’t
wanna hang out with us anymore.

00:18:49.647 --> 00:18:50.790
Oh.

00:18:50.815 --> 00:18:52.483
Now you’re suddenly quiet.

00:18:53.859 --> 00:18:55.152
You’re being serious.

00:18:57.571 --> 00:18:58.864
Just thinking about something.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:00.282
What?

00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:06.664
Have...

00:19:06.664 --> 00:19:07.957
Have you had your first kiss yet, Via?

00:19:09.375 --> 00:19:09.959
Me?

00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:13.045
I don’t think about stuff like that.

00:19:14.547 --> 00:19:15.589
Hmm.

00:19:17.383 --> 00:19:18.426
Yeah, me neither.

00:19:23.472 --> 00:19:25.016
What if you become my first kiss?

00:19:26.517 --> 00:19:27.268
Me?

00:19:27.268 --> 00:19:28.352
Yeah.

00:19:29.228 --> 00:19:30.405
Why me?

00:19:30.604 --> 00:19:34.316
It’s just, you’re always with
me for all my firsts, right?

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.154
And they say it’s supposed to be memorable.

00:19:39.447 --> 00:19:41.449
Then it wouldn’t be
memorable if it’s with me.

00:19:43.117 --> 00:19:44.076
Just here.

00:19:44.076 --> 00:19:45.202
Try it here.

00:19:45.991 --> 00:19:47.131
On the cheek.

00:19:47.738 --> 00:19:48.741
Here.

00:19:49.415 --> 00:19:50.082
Hey!

00:19:50.082 --> 00:19:50.916
I said here.

00:19:51.114 --> 00:19:52.115
Fine,

00:19:52.293 --> 00:19:53.514
then you do it.

00:19:53.878 --> 00:19:55.069
Here. Come on!

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:57.342
Try it.

00:20:01.469 --> 00:20:02.522
Come on.

00:20:05.056 --> 00:20:06.073
Come on, you’re taking too long.

00:20:06.098 --> 00:20:07.850
No, I don’t want to. I can’t.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:08.873
Huh?

00:20:11.103 --> 00:20:14.440
I’m going to sleep, Via.
We still have a lot of activities tomorrow.

00:20:14.732 --> 00:20:15.850
Good night.

00:20:19.612 --> 00:20:20.654
Okay.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.617
Why is he suddenly sleepy?

00:20:41.967 --> 00:20:43.027
Where’s—

00:20:43.052 --> 00:20:44.887
Jeez, I’ll just call Sam and—

00:20:44.887 --> 00:20:46.113
Hi, guys!

00:20:46.138 --> 00:20:47.615
- Hi, Pres!
- Hi, Pres!

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.975
By the way, Luna, great job
with the parlor games yesterday.

00:20:49.975 --> 00:20:51.310
It was super fun.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.020
I know, right? Thanks, Pres.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.814
Via, how’s your knee doing?

00:20:55.606 --> 00:20:57.650
It’s a bit better now, Pres. It’s healing.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:01.195
That’s good, because I brought
this for you. It’s good for the wound.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.784
You didn’t have to. Thank you, Pres.

00:21:06.784 --> 00:21:07.535
It’s nothing.

00:21:07.535 --> 00:21:09.011
Anyway, I’ll see you around?

00:21:09.036 --> 00:21:10.329
Thanks, Pres.

00:21:10.329 --> 00:21:12.081
Thank you, Pres.

00:21:16.252 --> 00:21:18.671
Hey! What was that?

00:21:18.896 --> 00:21:21.273
Pres seems concerned!
Something’s up between you two.

00:21:21.298 --> 00:21:23.926
- Oh, Via…
- What? What are you saying?

00:21:25.636 --> 00:21:28.597
No, man! I treated you to
fishballs last time.

00:21:28.597 --> 00:21:30.724
Now it’s your turn to buy me kwek-kwek.

00:21:30.724 --> 00:21:33.185
You jerk. So annoying.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.214
Where to now?

00:21:36.772 --> 00:21:38.065
To the Horror Booth!

00:21:38.065 --> 00:21:40.526
Wait! Let me call Yanna and Sam.

00:21:40.526 --> 00:21:43.612
Sam, Yanna! Where are you? Come out here.

00:21:43.612 --> 00:21:44.405
I’m so excited!

00:21:44.405 --> 00:21:45.614
- What now?
- Horror Booth, bro.

00:21:45.614 --> 00:21:47.825
Yanna, come with us.

00:21:47.992 --> 00:21:49.201
Sam too, come with us.

00:21:49.201 --> 00:21:49.869
Not interested.

00:21:49.869 --> 00:21:51.245
Come on, join us already.

00:21:51.245 --> 00:21:52.788
I’m not letting you kiss me again.

00:21:54.498 --> 00:21:55.541
So, let’s go?

00:21:56.125 --> 00:21:57.042
Let’s go, let’s go.

00:21:57.042 --> 00:21:58.377
Come with us.

00:21:59.128 --> 00:22:00.337
Please?

00:22:00.588 --> 00:22:03.048
Let’s go. It’s gonna be fun!

00:22:03.048 --> 00:22:05.342
Let’s go!

00:22:08.888 --> 00:22:10.472
Via, are you nervous?

00:22:11.765 --> 00:22:13.225
Don’t be scared, okay?

00:22:13.225 --> 00:22:14.643
Just hold on to me,

00:22:14.643 --> 00:22:15.728
all right?

00:22:16.103 --> 00:22:17.521
I’m not scared.

00:22:17.855 --> 00:22:19.356
- Okay.
- Let’s go.

00:22:30.201 --> 00:22:33.329
Why are you guys even scared?
They’re just people, you know.

00:22:33.329 --> 00:22:35.080
No screaming, okay?

00:22:36.917 --> 00:22:38.726
I thought no one was
supposed to scream?

00:22:38.751 --> 00:22:40.085
- See?
- It was huge.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.571
The Arts Club and I did
a great job on this, right?

00:22:43.505 --> 00:22:44.997
Sev, you idiot, nothing’s happening yet.

00:22:47.885 --> 00:22:49.904
Don’t hold on to me.

00:22:49.929 --> 00:22:51.154
Kino, wait—

00:22:51.388 --> 00:22:52.552
Kino, my shirt.

00:22:54.725 --> 00:22:55.935
Kino, my shirt.

00:23:02.733 --> 00:23:03.779
Kino!

00:23:05.236 --> 00:23:07.321
Excuse me—

00:23:09.073 --> 00:23:11.158
Via, Via!

00:23:11.158 --> 00:23:12.201
Via, let’s go.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.373
Hey!

00:23:22.086 --> 00:23:23.045
There’s a severed head—

00:23:23.045 --> 00:23:24.185
Sevi!

00:23:24.797 --> 00:23:26.215
You keep doing that!

00:23:53.325 --> 00:23:55.703
You’re such a troublemaker, Arkin.

00:23:55.869 --> 00:23:57.329
Why’d you punch him?

00:23:57.621 --> 00:23:59.665
Hey, no I didn’t! I saw Sevi
do it. Sevi punched him.

00:23:59.665 --> 00:24:00.749
- I promise.
- Sevi…

00:24:00.749 --> 00:24:02.918
Why me? You’re the one who was scared!

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:05.921
Poor guy.

00:24:06.046 --> 00:24:07.131
Via, you okay?

00:24:08.007 --> 00:24:10.634
Wow, you’re really asking me?

00:24:10.634 --> 00:24:12.594
You’re the one I should be worried about.

00:24:13.637 --> 00:24:14.638
Via, I’m sorry.

00:24:16.348 --> 00:24:17.349
It’s fine.

00:24:18.809 --> 00:24:20.769
Sorry for leaving you back there.

00:24:21.729 --> 00:24:23.397
It won’t happen again.

00:24:25.649 --> 00:24:26.670
All right.

00:24:27.842 --> 00:24:28.896
Hey, Yanna.

00:24:29.945 --> 00:24:31.707
You don’t have a
choice, okay? You’re our friend now.

00:24:31.732 --> 00:24:33.382
We’ve been
through a lot already.

00:24:33.407 --> 00:24:34.591
Right? Right?

00:24:34.616 --> 00:24:37.453
- We’ve been through a lot together.
- She’s right, yes!

00:24:39.663 --> 00:24:40.998
Silence means—

00:24:40.998 --> 00:24:45.169
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:24:46.003 --> 00:24:52.301
Group hug!

00:24:58.913 --> 00:25:00.289
Are they still coming?

00:25:00.768 --> 00:25:01.935
Probably in a bit.

00:25:02.227 --> 00:25:06.273
Sevi, Sam, and Luna got called
by the Student Council for a bit.

00:25:06.273 --> 00:25:08.409
Ke’s over at the Arts Club, and

00:25:08.433 --> 00:25:10.569
Yanna just went back to her
classroom to get something.

00:25:13.447 --> 00:25:15.115
It’s so quiet, I’m not used to it.

00:25:16.241 --> 00:25:17.509
Hey, it’s dismissal time.

00:25:17.534 --> 00:25:19.670
Are you sure it’s all right
for you to be out late today?

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.997
It’s fine. Pa’s coming home early anyway

00:25:21.997 --> 00:25:26.877
since it’s his last day at his job.
He got accepted as an in-house foreman at—

00:25:26.877 --> 00:25:30.923
He’ll be working at... VGC?

00:25:31.131 --> 00:25:32.633
Pa’s awesome.

00:25:37.596 --> 00:25:39.306
Via, Mama’s looking for you.

00:25:39.306 --> 00:25:40.432
What did Auntie say?

00:25:41.016 --> 00:25:42.893
She said maybe you’d want to
sleep over at our house later?

00:25:43.685 --> 00:25:45.896
I’ll ask Pa. I’ll send him a message.

00:25:45.896 --> 00:25:47.606
I’ll message Papa, too.

00:25:50.776 --> 00:25:52.027
You know what, Hiro,
you can take this seat.

00:25:52.027 --> 00:25:53.445
We’re about to leave anyway.
We’re just here for a bit.

00:25:53.445 --> 00:25:54.516
Wait…

00:25:54.541 --> 00:25:55.709
Stay for a bit, won’t you?

00:25:56.698 --> 00:25:57.783
Fine.

00:25:58.742 --> 00:26:01.036
I’m okay. Go ahead. I’ll find a seat.

00:26:01.829 --> 00:26:04.206
There are lots of booths
around, try them out.

00:26:05.124 --> 00:26:06.333
Hi, is this seat taken?

00:26:07.626 --> 00:26:08.919
It’s taken.

00:26:10.787 --> 00:26:11.843
Taken.

00:26:17.803 --> 00:26:19.179
Shut up, Shan.

00:26:21.974 --> 00:26:23.725
Hiro, you can take this
seat. I’m heading out.

00:26:23.725 --> 00:26:24.726
Are you sure?

00:26:25.346 --> 00:26:26.388
I’ll walk you out.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:27.813
I’ll be back.

00:26:27.813 --> 00:26:28.856
You sure?

00:26:29.148 --> 00:26:30.274
Hi, Pres!

00:26:33.694 --> 00:26:35.722
Hey, aren’t you guys gonna look around?

00:26:35.747 --> 00:26:37.207
Let’s go check out the booths.

00:26:37.239 --> 00:26:39.408
- Yeah, let’s make the most of it.
- Let’s go.

00:26:39.408 --> 00:26:42.136
Hey, I just got back and
you’re already leaving?

00:26:42.161 --> 00:26:43.245
I’ll stay here.

00:26:43.245 --> 00:26:45.205
Okay, I’ll stay with
you. You guys go ahead.

00:26:45.205 --> 00:26:45.747
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:26:45.747 --> 00:26:47.057
Take care of these, okay?

00:26:47.082 --> 00:26:48.934
- Let’s go.
- You guys can have those.

00:26:48.959 --> 00:26:50.478
There’s still a lot left in that, see?

00:26:54.506 --> 00:26:56.049
Sorry, excuse me.

00:26:57.229 --> 00:26:58.605
Wow, the kid’s got some attitude.

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:00.006
Come on, don’t argue with a kid.

00:27:00.031 --> 00:27:01.213
Your brother just left.

00:27:01.972 --> 00:27:03.017
Come on, let’s go.

00:27:07.519 --> 00:27:08.770
You want a stuffed
toy? I’ll win one for you.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:09.813
No, Kino.

00:27:09.813 --> 00:27:10.689
Hi, sir! Want to play?

00:27:10.689 --> 00:27:12.149
It’s just a waste of money, Kino.

00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:13.692
No, I’m good at this.

00:27:13.692 --> 00:27:16.069
I’m a real sharpshooter, I
can knock them all down.

00:27:16.069 --> 00:27:18.780
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.491
It’s embarrassing.

00:27:20.491 --> 00:27:22.701
Let’s go, someone else wants to play.

00:27:23.577 --> 00:27:26.246
You guys want to go first?
You might run out of stuffed toys.

00:27:26.246 --> 00:27:27.848
No, please, go ahead.

00:27:27.873 --> 00:27:29.249
All right, if you say so.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:30.726
Here.

00:27:30.751 --> 00:27:31.853
Just fifty, boss.

00:27:32.503 --> 00:27:33.253
Here you go.

00:27:33.253 --> 00:27:34.254
Hold on to it for now.

00:27:34.254 --> 00:27:35.392
Just in case.

00:27:45.098 --> 00:27:45.641
That’s the first—

00:27:45.641 --> 00:27:46.721
That was just the first shot.

00:27:51.772 --> 00:27:52.940
Do you know how to play, sir?

00:27:53.398 --> 00:27:55.067
I’ve still got two, see?

00:27:57.894 --> 00:28:00.521
Dude’s missing everything, huh?

00:28:05.118 --> 00:28:06.745
Yeah, he can’t shoot to save his life.

00:28:06.912 --> 00:28:07.996
That’s enough. Come on.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:10.424
- Such a waste of money—
- This thing’s rigged.

00:28:10.749 --> 00:28:12.209
See? The bullets are too soft.

00:28:12.209 --> 00:28:13.085
This is a scam.

00:28:13.085 --> 00:28:15.128
What scam? There’s no cheating here.

00:28:15.128 --> 00:28:16.755
Plenty of people
already won prizes earlier.

00:28:17.047 --> 00:28:18.215
You just don’t know how to aim.

00:28:21.093 --> 00:28:22.261
No, one more. One more.

00:28:22.427 --> 00:28:24.846
I know what adjustment to make this time—

00:28:24.846 --> 00:28:26.265
I can see it now. It’s all about the angle.

00:28:26.265 --> 00:28:27.324
See?

00:28:27.349 --> 00:28:28.642
- Watch this.
- This is your last one, okay?

00:28:38.318 --> 00:28:39.528
You’ve got no aim.

00:28:39.528 --> 00:28:42.322
You know, the scope on this thing’s
kinda crooked. This game’s rigged.

00:28:42.322 --> 00:28:43.991
You wanna give it a try, man?

00:28:44.241 --> 00:28:46.344
- Go ahead.
- But it’s tough, you know.

00:28:46.369 --> 00:28:48.912
It’s kinda off, the scope’s a bit tilted.

00:28:48.912 --> 00:28:50.205
Lim, you have cash?

00:28:50.205 --> 00:28:51.540
Yeah, here.

00:28:53.292 --> 00:28:54.084
- Okay.
- Thanks, Lim.

00:28:54.084 --> 00:28:55.586
- Go ahead.
- I’m telling you, that thing’s rigged.

00:28:55.586 --> 00:28:57.754
The gun’s crooked, and the sight—

00:28:57.754 --> 00:28:58.463
Crooked gun?

00:28:58.463 --> 00:28:59.214
Yeah.

00:28:59.214 --> 00:29:01.133
You’ll just waste your money, man.

00:29:01.804 --> 00:29:03.181
I’m warning you.

00:29:07.764 --> 00:29:09.975
Wow.

00:29:16.148 --> 00:29:17.816
Awesome.

00:29:24.489 --> 00:29:25.991
That’s amazing.

00:29:27.993 --> 00:29:29.428
Told you.

00:29:29.453 --> 00:29:30.871
You just don’t know how to shoot.

00:29:31.163 --> 00:29:32.706
Congratulations, sir.

00:29:33.665 --> 00:29:35.292
- Maybe—
- That’s huge.

00:29:38.045 --> 00:29:39.588
What am I supposed to do with this?

00:29:39.588 --> 00:29:41.423
I don’t know, maybe you can cuddle with it.

00:29:42.382 --> 00:29:43.392
No, one more try.

00:29:43.766 --> 00:29:45.643
- I’m not giving up.
- Lim, you get it. You paid for it.

00:29:46.177 --> 00:29:47.529
I don’t have a use for it.

00:29:47.554 --> 00:29:48.388
Let me try first!

00:29:48.388 --> 00:29:49.598
Give it to KJ.

00:29:50.015 --> 00:29:50.932
Hold on, I’ll try it out.

00:29:50.932 --> 00:29:54.770
All right, big bro’s got
a gift for you, little man.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:56.104
- Adjust it a bit—
- I kno—

00:29:56.104 --> 00:29:57.230
I got this. Watch me.

00:29:57.983 --> 00:29:59.276
I’m outta here, man.

00:30:00.067 --> 00:30:01.360
Maybe tilt it like five degrees.

00:30:01.693 --> 00:30:02.697
Such a killjoy.

00:30:13.997 --> 00:30:15.499
- See?
- There!

00:30:15.499 --> 00:30:16.750
It wasn’t crooked.

00:30:17.125 --> 00:30:19.252
Maybe you’re just lucky today, huh?

00:30:19.586 --> 00:30:21.546
Congrats, ma’am. Here’s your prize too.

00:30:22.547 --> 00:30:24.066
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

00:30:24.091 --> 00:30:24.800
It’s cute.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.193
It’s too small. Not good enough—

00:30:26.218 --> 00:30:28.887
I’ll win you a bigger one. About this big.

00:30:28.887 --> 00:30:29.988
Leave it to me.

00:30:30.013 --> 00:30:30.931
- That’s enough, Kino. Stop it!
- Don’t forget my change.

00:30:30.931 --> 00:30:32.307
- I said stop!
- No, no. I got this.

00:30:32.307 --> 00:30:35.102
So when we go home, it’ll
be bigger than the one he won.

00:30:35.102 --> 00:30:36.133
This is embarrassing.

00:30:36.158 --> 00:30:37.396
It’s fine, don’t worry.

00:30:37.396 --> 00:30:38.313
- I’m telling you—
- Others might still want to play.

00:30:38.313 --> 00:30:39.356
Hey, guys!

00:30:39.523 --> 00:30:41.733
Hi, guys! Have you seen Sevi?

00:30:41.758 --> 00:30:42.846
No.

00:30:43.276 --> 00:30:46.081
A penguin! That’s so cute!

00:30:46.106 --> 00:30:48.191
You want it? You can have it.

00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:50.575
There’s no need, but thank you.

00:30:50.575 --> 00:30:51.868
Hey, you can take this one too.

00:30:52.411 --> 00:30:54.037
Oh, wow!

00:30:55.455 --> 00:30:56.748
- Thank you!
- Sam?

00:30:56.748 --> 00:30:59.668
Sevi’s at the back, maybe
we can go see him later.

00:30:59.668 --> 00:31:01.294
Huh? Okay.

00:31:02.754 --> 00:31:04.172
Working hard, Pres.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:07.794
Hello, I—

00:31:08.301 --> 00:31:09.720
Are you looking for your brother?

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:10.721
Actually I was with him a while ago—

00:31:10.721 --> 00:31:11.810
I know.

00:31:12.264 --> 00:31:13.515
I saw.

00:31:14.725 --> 00:31:15.784
Nice.

00:31:15.809 --> 00:31:16.560
Yeah.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.228
By the way, I’ll go ahead.

00:31:19.062 --> 00:31:19.980
Okay.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.130
Take care.

00:31:21.481 --> 00:31:22.691
Keep it up, Pres.

00:31:23.567 --> 00:31:24.856
Thank you.

00:31:25.402 --> 00:31:26.278
Kino, don’t do that—

00:31:26.278 --> 00:31:28.113
You’re cheating, that’s too long—

00:31:28.113 --> 00:31:29.423
Sam, shall we go?

00:31:29.448 --> 00:31:30.115
- Okay.
- It’s right by the red table.

00:31:30.115 --> 00:31:31.255
Here!

00:31:32.659 --> 00:31:34.327
We’ll go ahead. Bye!

00:31:34.578 --> 00:31:36.288
- Bye, Sam. Take care.
- Via!

00:31:36.913 --> 00:31:37.497
We’ll go ahead.

00:31:37.497 --> 00:31:38.039
See you around.

00:31:38.039 --> 00:31:38.790
- Bye, guys!
- Bye, Pres!

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:39.583
Still nothing?

00:31:39.583 --> 00:31:40.763
What the heck.

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:43.895
My Via! My Via! My Via!

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.397
Come here! Come here!

00:31:45.422 --> 00:31:47.132
- Kino, wait a sec.
- Aren’t you gonna get karma for this, man?

00:31:47.132 --> 00:31:49.926
We’re selling some over there.
Just buy one instead.

00:31:53.972 --> 00:31:55.282
So you really have a crush on Pres?

00:31:55.307 --> 00:31:56.395
Huh?

00:31:59.019 --> 00:32:00.520
Pres is just being friendly.

00:32:01.021 --> 00:32:02.939
Just friendly? You always talk.

00:32:02.939 --> 00:32:06.401
And he even gave you
that… antiseptic cream?

00:32:06.401 --> 00:32:07.497
Am I right?

00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:11.999
So you do have a crush on him!

00:32:14.201 --> 00:32:15.489
Crush?

00:32:15.702 --> 00:32:17.162
Do I really have a crush on Pres?

00:32:18.455 --> 00:32:19.708
I don’t know.

00:32:19.998 --> 00:32:21.333
It’s just that Pres—

00:32:22.626 --> 00:32:23.668
He’s kind.

00:32:24.211 --> 00:32:25.378
Smart.

00:32:25.837 --> 00:32:27.088
Responsible.

00:32:27.589 --> 00:32:28.591
And—

00:32:30.091 --> 00:32:32.260
I think he’s good-looking, too.

00:32:33.011 --> 00:32:34.821
You’ve got so many adjectives for him.

00:32:34.846 --> 00:32:36.014
That’s how you describe a crush!

00:32:37.057 --> 00:32:38.141
Do I have a crush on him?

00:32:38.558 --> 00:32:39.476
- Is that how it works?
- Yes!

00:32:39.476 --> 00:32:41.536
Yeah, that’s how it works.

00:32:41.561 --> 00:32:43.688
You notice so many good qualities in him.

00:32:43.688 --> 00:32:45.190
That means you have a crush on him.

00:32:48.944 --> 00:32:51.196
Does that mean I also have a crush on Kino?

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:54.157
I admire a lot of things about him too.

00:32:54.866 --> 00:32:56.117
Probably not.

00:32:56.701 --> 00:32:58.078
They’re different.

00:32:58.453 --> 00:33:00.747
Kino’s my friend, so that’s why.

00:33:04.626 --> 00:33:05.644
Via!

00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:06.670
I won one for you..

00:33:07.379 --> 00:33:08.544
Here.

00:33:10.757 --> 00:33:12.259
Wow!

00:33:12.259 --> 00:33:14.845
Congratulations, you finally won.

00:33:14.845 --> 00:33:16.012
Of course.

00:33:16.263 --> 00:33:17.806
Thank you, you’re really good.

00:33:18.598 --> 00:33:20.684
How much did you spend?
You used up all your allowance, huh?

00:33:22.769 --> 00:33:24.271
There’s a little left.

00:33:26.606 --> 00:33:28.900
Wow! So cute!

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.361
- Luna, look! I won this earlier.
- That one’s cuter!

00:33:31.736 --> 00:33:33.572
I think this is all they had left.

00:33:34.656 --> 00:33:36.157
By the way, Papa replied.

00:33:36.157 --> 00:33:37.284
Yeah?

00:33:37.284 --> 00:33:39.119
He said you can sleep
over at our house later.

00:33:40.996 --> 00:33:42.539
Let’s go!

00:33:42.539 --> 00:33:44.165
You haven’t been here in a while.

00:33:45.223 --> 00:33:46.183
Is Auntie there?

00:33:46.209 --> 00:33:47.335
Yup.

00:33:49.004 --> 00:33:49.979
Hi, Ma.

00:33:50.229 --> 00:33:51.298
- Here's Via.
- Via?

00:33:51.298 --> 00:33:53.008
- Hi, Auntie!
- Good thing you made it.

00:33:53.008 --> 00:33:53.925
How are you?

00:33:53.925 --> 00:33:55.902
You never visit anymore.

00:33:55.927 --> 00:33:57.279
How are you? How have you been?

00:33:57.304 --> 00:33:58.572
Are you doing all right?

00:33:58.597 --> 00:34:01.766
Ma, we just got here. You’re asking a lot.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:03.602
- I’ve been doing okay.
- It’s been so long—

00:34:03.602 --> 00:34:05.645
It’s been so long since I’ve seen Via.

00:34:06.438 --> 00:34:09.107
I’ve been fine, just got
really busy with school

00:34:09.107 --> 00:34:11.682
and I’ve been taking
care of Ysha and Mira too.

00:34:12.193 --> 00:34:13.503
How are your siblings doing?

00:34:13.528 --> 00:34:14.571
I’ll take you all shopping.

00:34:14.738 --> 00:34:15.799
What?

00:34:16.047 --> 00:34:17.841
Oh no, Auntie. There's no need.

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:18.909
It’s just a reward.

00:34:19.034 --> 00:34:21.094
I’m sure you’ve been studying hard.

00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:22.746
Let me do this.
I don’t get to do it often.

00:34:23.767 --> 00:34:24.822
Thank you.

00:34:25.248 --> 00:34:26.875
Via! Oh, you’re here.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.168
How’s your Papa?

00:34:28.367 --> 00:34:30.150
He’s fine, Uncle.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.631
He just got accepted at a new company.

00:34:32.815 --> 00:34:33.673
- Oh wow.
- Wow.

00:34:33.673 --> 00:34:35.108
That’s amazing.

00:34:35.133 --> 00:34:37.260
How’s school? Especially this one here.

00:34:39.262 --> 00:34:40.764
Is he still studying?

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:42.432
He’s always coming home late.

00:34:43.187 --> 00:34:45.440
He’s just been really busy
with Music Club, Auntie.

00:34:45.465 --> 00:34:48.037
And he’s also the photographer
for our school paper.

00:34:48.063 --> 00:34:51.316
Kino’s been really hardworking.

00:34:51.816 --> 00:34:52.651
Is that so?

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:53.627
Yes, Pa.

00:34:53.652 --> 00:34:55.779
That’s good, that’s good. I’m proud of you.

00:34:55.779 --> 00:34:56.780
- Thank you, Pa.
- Good job, son.

00:34:56.805 --> 00:34:59.541
- Just enjoy your high school life. Okay?
- Yes.

00:34:59.699 --> 00:35:01.034
Are you hungry? Let’s eat.

00:35:01.034 --> 00:35:01.843
Let’s go.

00:35:01.868 --> 00:35:02.369
Okay.

00:35:02.369 --> 00:35:03.470
Are you hungry now?

00:35:03.495 --> 00:35:04.996
A bit. I’m sure you’re hungry.

00:35:04.996 --> 00:35:05.626
You’ve been saying
you’re hungry for a while now.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:06.014
I cooked your favorite.

00:35:06.039 --> 00:35:07.040
- You’re really good at—
- The kare-kare.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.125
- Of course.
- But there’s no banana blossom.

00:35:09.125 --> 00:35:10.961
We only have bok choy.

00:35:17.133 --> 00:35:20.345
Make sure the door’s closed, okay?

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:22.747
And check the windows
too, make sure they’re locked.

00:35:23.306 --> 00:35:28.411
Mira, ask Papa if he turned off the gas.

00:35:28.436 --> 00:35:30.605
It might still be open.

00:35:31.314 --> 00:35:34.693
And don’t watch TV anymore, all right?

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.029
Go to sleep but say your prayers first.

00:35:38.238 --> 00:35:40.615
Okay then. Good night. Love you!

00:35:54.129 --> 00:35:55.630
Does your wound still hurt?

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:56.673
Huh?

00:35:56.673 --> 00:35:58.174
Wait, I’ll get you some medicine.

00:35:58.174 --> 00:35:59.275
No, it’s fine.

00:35:59.573 --> 00:36:01.455
It doesn’t really hurt anymore.

00:36:01.647 --> 00:36:04.065
I’m just putting this
cream so it heals faster.

00:36:05.146 --> 00:36:06.299
Okay.

00:36:14.315 --> 00:36:17.043
You didn’t have to. Thank you, Pres.

00:36:17.068 --> 00:36:18.111
It’s nothing.

00:36:18.611 --> 00:36:20.780
You notice so many good qualities in him.

00:36:21.192 --> 00:36:22.799
That means you have a crush on him.

00:36:32.542 --> 00:36:33.768
Oh no.

00:36:33.793 --> 00:36:35.545
What’s got you smiling like that?

00:36:35.754 --> 00:36:36.921
What’s going on?

00:36:39.716 --> 00:36:41.468
Why are you smiling?

00:36:42.469 --> 00:36:43.636
What is it?

00:36:52.604 --> 00:36:53.635
Kino…

00:36:54.064 --> 00:36:54.956
Yes?

00:36:54.981 --> 00:36:56.733
I think I have a crush.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:00.350
A crush, huh? You’ve really grown up.

00:37:00.375 --> 00:37:01.362
You’ve got a crush now.

00:37:01.362 --> 00:37:02.447
Oh, come on.

00:37:02.447 --> 00:37:03.948
So who’s your crush? Tell me.

00:37:03.948 --> 00:37:04.749
Who is it?

00:37:04.774 --> 00:37:05.901
Who’s your crush?

00:37:11.164 --> 00:37:12.499
It’s Pres.

00:37:13.249 --> 00:37:14.487
Pres?

00:37:14.542 --> 00:37:15.668
The President?

00:37:15.835 --> 00:37:16.878
Acel?

00:37:17.212 --> 00:37:18.323
Chevy?

00:37:20.632 --> 00:37:22.008
So it’s Pres you like.

00:37:22.008 --> 00:37:23.510
So, let’s make a love team for you two.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:25.720
Like, Via-Vy.

00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:27.924
Or Via-Chevy. How’s that?

00:37:28.615 --> 00:37:29.991
What are you talking about?

00:37:30.241 --> 00:37:33.578
It’s not… it’s not that serious.

00:37:33.603 --> 00:37:34.687
Well…

00:37:37.196 --> 00:37:39.031
A happy crush?

00:37:40.026 --> 00:37:41.111
A happy crush?

00:37:43.238 --> 00:37:44.989
So that’s your type, huh?

00:37:45.365 --> 00:37:50.370
Smart, responsible, leader types.

00:37:52.747 --> 00:37:54.999
Not really.

00:37:55.917 --> 00:37:56.876
Also…

00:37:59.254 --> 00:38:01.756
Pres is handsome, isn’t he?

00:38:02.757 --> 00:38:03.842
Yeah, he is.

00:38:06.219 --> 00:38:07.387
So, what’s your plan?

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:09.124
Huh?

00:38:09.302 --> 00:38:11.224
- What’s the plan?
- Plan?

00:38:11.224 --> 00:38:12.534
With what?

00:38:12.559 --> 00:38:14.310
You want me to help you?

00:38:15.395 --> 00:38:18.064
I can get close to Pres
first, then once we’re friends,

00:38:18.064 --> 00:38:20.024
it’ll be easier for you two to get close.

00:38:20.275 --> 00:38:22.360
See? Great idea, right?

00:38:22.507 --> 00:38:23.878
Well?

00:38:23.903 --> 00:38:25.321
That’s not necessary.

00:38:29.409 --> 00:38:30.618
You know…

00:38:32.912 --> 00:38:33.872
I just thought of something.

00:38:35.248 --> 00:38:36.288
What if...

00:38:37.584 --> 00:38:39.002
we don’t hang out too much at school?

00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:42.519
That way, you’ll have a better
chance to get close to Pres.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:45.842
He might think that I’m your boyfriend.

00:38:45.842 --> 00:38:47.124
That’d be a waste.

00:38:49.345 --> 00:38:50.822
Why are you laughing?

00:38:50.847 --> 00:38:52.740
You’re such a joker!

00:38:52.765 --> 00:38:55.710
Why would he think you’re my boyfriend?

00:38:57.618 --> 00:38:59.329
Who said I’m joking? I’m serious.

00:38:59.856 --> 00:39:02.442
Besides, maybe that’s for the best.

00:39:03.158 --> 00:39:04.534
For you. For your crush.

00:39:08.281 --> 00:39:11.951
I don’t think Kino really
means what he’s saying.

00:39:12.827 --> 00:39:14.204
Hmm...

00:39:14.579 --> 00:39:15.955
Suit yourself.

00:39:17.201 --> 00:39:19.286
If you think that’ll make things better.

00:39:28.593 --> 00:39:29.874
I’m sleepy, Via.

00:39:31.054 --> 00:39:32.179
Good night, Via.

00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:36.250
You’re already sleepy?

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.645
So soon?

00:39:42.093 --> 00:39:43.452
Good night, Kino.

00:40:06.923 --> 00:40:09.234
Let me see your homework first.

00:40:09.259 --> 00:40:10.351
Here, Via.

00:40:10.607 --> 00:40:12.234
Here, Via. I’m done.

00:40:12.845 --> 00:40:15.515
Wow, very good!

00:40:16.538 --> 00:40:18.184
Very good!

00:40:18.184 --> 00:40:21.020
Here, these are gifts from Aunt Allie.

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.197
Because you both did a
great job on your homework.

00:40:23.233 --> 00:40:24.207
Wow! Look, Mira!

00:40:24.232 --> 00:40:25.166
Thank you, Via!

00:40:25.191 --> 00:40:26.491
- It’s so pretty.
- So pretty!

00:40:26.648 --> 00:40:27.668
- Thank you, Via.
- You like it?

00:40:27.694 --> 00:40:29.529
Okay, go play with it in your room,

00:40:29.529 --> 00:40:30.780
but don’t be too noisy or—

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.366
you might wake Aidan up.

00:40:33.616 --> 00:40:34.742
Come on, Ysha!

00:40:44.919 --> 00:40:46.062
Hello, Pa?

00:40:46.087 --> 00:40:47.257
Hello?

00:40:47.338 --> 00:40:48.398
Hello?

00:40:48.578 --> 00:40:49.773
Hello?

00:40:50.588 --> 00:40:51.796
Who’s this?

00:40:52.376 --> 00:40:53.418
Where’s Pa?

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.449
Are you Ranil’s daughter?

00:40:55.638 --> 00:40:57.890
We’re in front of your house.

00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:59.017
Your dad’s drunk.

00:40:59.017 --> 00:41:00.124
Huh?

00:41:00.727 --> 00:41:01.859
Wait, just a second.

00:41:06.941 --> 00:41:07.625
Pa?

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:08.813
Pa.

00:41:08.838 --> 00:41:10.340
Pa? Pa.

00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:12.755
- Come in, please.
- Careful. Be careful.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:13.506
Pa?

00:41:13.531 --> 00:41:14.574
Step inside, please.

00:41:15.033 --> 00:41:16.075
There you go.

00:41:17.035 --> 00:41:18.077
Hey, hey, hey.

00:41:20.288 --> 00:41:21.205
Sevi?

00:41:21.205 --> 00:41:22.248
Via? What are you—

00:41:23.207 --> 00:41:25.001
He’s your dad?

00:41:25.209 --> 00:41:26.060
Via—

00:41:26.085 --> 00:41:29.689
This is Engineer Camero. He’s
a really, really, really good man.

00:41:29.714 --> 00:41:30.882
He’s my boss. My boss.

00:41:30.882 --> 00:41:31.899
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

00:41:31.931 --> 00:41:33.507
You’re praising me too much.

00:41:33.843 --> 00:41:36.262
Sevi, let’s help him inside

00:41:36.262 --> 00:41:38.023
so Via doesn’t have a hard time.

00:41:38.348 --> 00:41:39.390
Your name’s Via, right?

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:40.516
Yes, sir. Via

00:41:40.516 --> 00:41:42.143
Sevi, I’ll take this. This way, sir.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:43.686
Come in. Inside. Sevi, over here.

00:41:43.686 --> 00:41:44.937
Come on in. This way, Sevi.

00:41:44.937 --> 00:41:47.815
- Via, your dad can really drink.
- Easy, easy.

00:41:49.233 --> 00:41:50.151
Quiet down.

00:41:50.151 --> 00:41:52.362
This way, sir. Careful, you might slip.

00:41:52.528 --> 00:41:53.863
- Step here, please.
- Over here.

00:41:53.863 --> 00:41:55.343
- Pa, take a step.
- You okay, Dad?

00:41:55.698 --> 00:41:56.674
- Pa.
- Okay.

00:41:56.699 --> 00:41:58.326
You got this. Go ahead.

00:41:59.035 --> 00:41:59.869
Dito, Sevi.
Over here, Sevi.

00:41:59.869 --> 00:42:01.095
Dad, just stay there. I got this.

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.257
All right.

00:42:02.413 --> 00:42:03.507
There you go. A little more.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:05.291
Hurry, Pa.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.105
I’m really sorry for the trouble, sir.

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:12.799
Thank you so much for bringing Papa home.

00:42:12.799 --> 00:42:14.258
Please don’t fire him.

00:42:14.717 --> 00:42:19.555
Don’t worry, your dad’s not losing his job.

00:42:20.306 --> 00:42:21.641
He’s been a big help to us.

00:42:22.058 --> 00:42:25.019
Besides, he’s a good drinking buddy.

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:29.190
Dad’s a drinker too, so it’s fine.

00:42:32.235 --> 00:42:33.319
How old are you, Via?

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:38.825
You seem more mature than my son.

00:42:39.942 --> 00:42:43.195
The first thing you thought
about was your dad’s job.

00:42:44.222 --> 00:42:45.431
Why me?

00:42:45.456 --> 00:42:47.291
You’re the childish one here, Dad.

00:42:47.291 --> 00:42:49.877
You’re the reason Via’s dad got drunk!

00:42:49.877 --> 00:42:54.424
You said whoever finishes the bottle first
wins a house and lot.

00:42:54.424 --> 00:42:56.843
- Didn’t you?
- Who knew he’d take it seriously?

00:42:56.843 --> 00:43:01.055
Sorry about that. But I don’t have
a house and lot to give right now.

00:43:02.515 --> 00:43:04.225
It’s okay, really.

00:43:04.225 --> 00:43:07.562
I’m really sorry.
Thank you for making sure he got home safe.

00:43:08.104 --> 00:43:09.231
Thanks again.

00:43:10.022 --> 00:43:11.983
Sorry about that, Via.

00:43:13.276 --> 00:43:14.652
- We’ll go ahead.
- See you, Via.

00:43:15.492 --> 00:43:17.995
Tell me if this guy gives
you trouble at school.

00:43:19.532 --> 00:43:20.867
You talk too much. Let’s go!

00:43:20.867 --> 00:43:24.620
Thanks again for bringing Papa home.
Sorry for the trouble.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:25.413
Take care.

00:43:25.413 --> 00:43:27.415
- Sevi, thanks.
- Sure.

00:43:28.124 --> 00:43:29.292
- I’ll walk you out.
- I’ll help you, Dad.

00:43:29.667 --> 00:43:30.935
Here, here.

00:43:48.269 --> 00:43:49.729
Pa, I got it, I got it.

00:43:49.729 --> 00:43:50.730
Sit down for a bit.

00:43:51.397 --> 00:43:52.607
I got it.

00:43:58.029 --> 00:43:58.738
Pa.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:05.411
You know,

00:44:05.995 --> 00:44:08.039
I’m really lucky to have you.

00:44:10.082 --> 00:44:13.628
I don’t even know what I did

00:44:16.214 --> 00:44:20.593
to deserve such a responsible kid like you.

00:44:25.223 --> 00:44:26.487
I’m sorry if

00:44:27.725 --> 00:44:33.648
sometimes it feels like you have to do
everything around the house.

00:44:35.566 --> 00:44:37.652
That’s supposed to be my job.

00:44:46.786 --> 00:44:48.496
Are you crying, Pa?

00:44:49.038 --> 00:44:50.181
No.

00:44:50.206 --> 00:44:51.290
No?

00:44:56.379 --> 00:44:57.505
Pa.

00:44:59.674 --> 00:45:01.592
We’re family, right?

00:45:03.711 --> 00:45:07.173
Who else would help
each other out but family.

00:45:08.432 --> 00:45:10.101
I’m okay.

00:45:12.061 --> 00:45:13.896
Thank you, sweetheart.

00:45:15.231 --> 00:45:16.232
Thank you, Pa.

00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:20.236
Thank you.

00:45:22.405 --> 00:45:23.906
So, someone called me, right?

00:45:24.115 --> 00:45:26.592
I thought it was Papa,
but it turned out to be someone else.

00:45:26.617 --> 00:45:27.727
So, I went outside.

00:45:27.952 --> 00:45:31.722
I was so shocked to see Papa
was completely drunk.

00:45:31.747 --> 00:45:34.041
It’s the first time I’ve
seen him that drunk.

00:45:35.126 --> 00:45:38.337
Anyway, Sevi and his dad were the ones
who brought him home.

00:45:39.246 --> 00:45:41.868
Engineer Camero’s actually Papa’s new boss.

00:45:43.634 --> 00:45:45.319
I’m just glad he got home safe.

00:45:45.344 --> 00:45:46.767
Yeah, me too.

00:45:47.346 --> 00:45:51.001
By the way, I might be coming
home late for the next few days.

00:45:51.976 --> 00:45:54.937
They said the training for the
national competition will take longer.

00:46:07.575 --> 00:46:09.327
Kino’s been awfully quiet.

00:46:09.327 --> 00:46:10.870
I wonder if something’s bothering him.

00:46:11.412 --> 00:46:12.913
Via,

00:46:12.913 --> 00:46:14.832
do you remember what I
told you the other night?

00:46:15.374 --> 00:46:16.454
Huh?

00:46:17.251 --> 00:46:21.088
Maybe it’s better if we don’t
hang out too much at school.

00:46:25.134 --> 00:46:27.403
People might think I’m your boyfriend.

00:46:27.474 --> 00:46:29.868
It would be a shame if you didn’t
get a chance with your crush.

00:46:35.169 --> 00:46:36.837
I’ll go ahead, Via.

00:46:36.978 --> 00:46:38.188
I’ll see you later.

00:46:43.444 --> 00:46:45.237
He was serious about that?

00:46:53.371 --> 00:46:54.830
Eat, jerk.

00:46:55.956 --> 00:46:56.999
Tony!

00:47:01.754 --> 00:47:03.339
Are you and Arkin fighting?

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.345
Huh?

00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:07.071
Of course not.

00:47:11.764 --> 00:47:12.932
Hi, Pres.

00:47:14.433 --> 00:47:15.768
Hey! How’s it going?

00:47:15.893 --> 00:47:18.562
Via wants to know what your food is.

00:47:21.691 --> 00:47:22.900
I’m having pasta.

00:47:26.195 --> 00:47:27.462
Enjoy your meal!

00:47:34.161 --> 00:47:35.371
They are fighting.

00:47:36.455 --> 00:47:37.915
We’re not!

00:47:37.915 --> 00:47:39.083
Yeah, right.

00:47:57.056 --> 00:47:58.786
Where are you, Kino?

00:47:58.811 --> 00:48:01.397
I’ve been waiting here for 30 minutes.

00:48:01.856 --> 00:48:03.733
Are we still going home together,

00:48:03.983 --> 00:48:06.068
or did he already leave?

00:48:09.196 --> 00:48:10.391
Via.

00:48:11.407 --> 00:48:12.555
- Pres.
- You’re still here.

00:48:13.909 --> 00:48:15.126
Yeah.

00:48:15.244 --> 00:48:17.997
Training ended late today.

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:20.332
Are you going home?

00:48:22.293 --> 00:48:23.294
Where to?

00:48:25.337 --> 00:48:29.008
Just by the jeep terminal.
I’m about to head home too.

00:48:30.551 --> 00:48:33.304
I was supposed to drop
by the computer shop, but—

00:48:34.346 --> 00:48:35.723
plans changed.

00:48:35.723 --> 00:48:37.767
me on, I’ll walk you to the terminal.

00:48:38.142 --> 00:48:38.868
Huh?

00:48:38.893 --> 00:48:40.019
I’ll walk you there.

00:48:40.019 --> 00:48:41.520
Oh no, Pres, it’s fine.

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.606
You might have to go out of your way.
I’d feel bad.

00:48:43.731 --> 00:48:44.790
It’s fine.

00:48:44.815 --> 00:48:46.317
Come on, I’ll take you.

00:48:46.609 --> 00:48:48.611
- Let’s go.
- Okay.

00:48:52.156 --> 00:48:53.407
How was training?

00:48:58.496 --> 00:49:00.598
One more seat left!

00:49:00.623 --> 00:49:01.957
Just one!

00:49:02.625 --> 00:49:03.851
I’ll take it!

00:49:03.876 --> 00:49:05.329
- Pres, I’ll go ahead.
- All right, hop in.

00:49:05.461 --> 00:49:06.754
Thanks. Take care.

00:49:07.296 --> 00:49:08.407
- Here you go.
- Take care!

00:49:09.507 --> 00:49:10.883
- Your change.
- Thanks.

00:49:10.908 --> 00:49:13.202
- Excuse me, please.
- Boss, it’s full.

00:49:21.852 --> 00:49:24.313
Okay, the rest of you,
take the other jeep.

00:49:24.814 --> 00:49:26.899
All right, get in, get in!

00:49:33.948 --> 00:49:37.326
Seems like you’ve been hanging
out with your friends a lot lately.

00:49:38.577 --> 00:49:39.995
I always do.

00:49:44.291 --> 00:49:45.960
Is something wrong with us, Kino?

00:49:47.211 --> 00:49:48.504
No. Why?

00:49:50.089 --> 00:49:51.757
Nothing, really.

00:49:51.757 --> 00:49:55.094
Yesterday, I thought you
were going to wait for me.

00:49:55.928 --> 00:49:58.305
After training.

00:49:58.305 --> 00:49:59.682
Turns out you already went home.

00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:04.610
Yeah. I got sleepy,
so I just went home.

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:07.982
The music club rehearsal
was pretty tiring too.

00:50:07.982 --> 00:50:09.358
I’m sorry.

00:50:09.915 --> 00:50:11.292
It’s all right.

00:50:11.861 --> 00:50:12.903
I’ll see you..

00:50:12.903 --> 00:50:14.989
What about your lunch—

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:24.498
He’s taking his plan way too seriously.

00:50:39.517 --> 00:50:41.603
I honestly thought you
and Arkin had a fight.

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:45.102
What? We didn’t fight.

00:50:45.102 --> 00:50:47.229
Yeah, I was even about to get worried.

00:50:47.229 --> 00:50:49.356
But then I saw you two yesterday,

00:50:49.356 --> 00:50:51.442
he was
waiting for you by the gate.

00:50:52.276 --> 00:50:52.960
Huh?

00:50:52.985 --> 00:50:54.110
Yeah.

00:50:54.778 --> 00:50:56.780
He went home early yesterday, didn’t he?

00:50:58.157 --> 00:50:59.158
What are you talking about?

00:50:59.158 --> 00:51:02.161
We literally saw him waiting by the gate,
right, Ke?

00:51:02.161 --> 00:51:04.705
Yeah. I even invited
him to go home with us.

00:51:04.705 --> 00:51:07.750
He said he was going to wait for you,
so we just went home.

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:08.918
Exactly.

00:51:12.796 --> 00:51:15.257
You two are totally messing with me.

00:51:15.282 --> 00:51:17.149
Pinky swear! Cross my heart.

00:51:18.344 --> 00:51:19.803
Heart, heart.

00:51:19.803 --> 00:51:22.681
So he didn’t really go home right away?

00:51:24.725 --> 00:51:27.394
Meaning you two didn’t go
home together yesterday?

00:51:27.394 --> 00:51:28.604
You didn’t see him?

00:51:33.525 --> 00:51:35.527
Let’s just finish this.
Ma’am might get mad.

00:51:49.208 --> 00:51:50.167
Seriously.

00:51:50.167 --> 00:51:51.502
I’ll take this off.

00:51:52.294 --> 00:51:53.545
Where did you get that cut?

00:51:53.545 --> 00:51:54.672
Yeah.

00:51:54.672 --> 00:51:56.298
How'd that happen?

00:51:59.969 --> 00:52:02.262
Should I give him his lunch box?

00:52:09.144 --> 00:52:10.162
Luna.

00:52:10.187 --> 00:52:11.647
Luna, can we talk?

00:52:11.897 --> 00:52:12.856
Lance, no.

00:52:12.856 --> 00:52:14.066
- Come on.
- Babe, please?

00:52:14.233 --> 00:52:15.609
Lance, I said no.

00:52:15.609 --> 00:52:16.443
It’ll just take a minute,
I promise.

00:52:16.443 --> 00:52:17.059
Let’s just talk.

00:52:17.084 --> 00:52:18.501
What did I just say? I said no!

00:52:19.196 --> 00:52:20.322
Lance, what’s your problem?

00:52:20.322 --> 00:52:21.490
Can’t you hear her?

00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:22.591
I said no!

00:52:22.616 --> 00:52:23.759
It’ll just be quick!

00:52:23.784 --> 00:52:25.703
Lance, she said she
doesn’t want to talk to you.

00:52:25.703 --> 00:52:26.662
Listen to her.

00:52:26.662 --> 00:52:27.788
Via, you’re so noisy!

00:52:27.788 --> 00:52:29.123
You’re not listening to Luna!

00:52:29.123 --> 00:52:30.457
- She doesn’t want to talk to you!
- I’m not talking to you, okay?

00:52:30.457 --> 00:52:31.500
Leave Luna alone!

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.252
You’re not even the one I’m talking to!

00:52:33.252 --> 00:52:34.586
Lance, stop it!

00:52:35.587 --> 00:52:36.630
Hey,

00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:37.715
Why do you even have a packed lunch?

00:52:37.715 --> 00:52:38.716
What are you, in first grade?

00:52:38.716 --> 00:52:41.376
At least I don’t act like one.

00:52:41.844 --> 00:52:42.636
That looks tasty, though.

00:52:42.636 --> 00:52:43.719
Lance.

00:52:44.138 --> 00:52:44.930
Lance, cut it out!

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:47.157
What the! Make your own!

00:52:47.266 --> 00:52:48.142
- Give it to me!
- Lance!

00:52:48.142 --> 00:52:49.518
Give it back!

00:52:51.061 --> 00:52:52.665
Oops, dropped it.

00:52:53.689 --> 00:52:55.821
Looks like you don’t have
a tasty lunch anymore.

00:52:59.319 --> 00:53:01.238
- Lance, what’s wrong with you?
- Hey!

00:53:27.222 --> 00:53:28.849
Put that down.

00:54:24.791 --> 00:54:27.002
Hey, Arkin, want a ride home?

00:54:28.534 --> 00:54:29.993
No thanks.
I’m waiting for Via.

00:54:30.018 --> 00:54:31.240
She’s almost done anyway.

00:54:31.778 --> 00:54:34.030
She might take a while, but all right.

00:54:35.457 --> 00:54:37.793
- Take care.
- Bye!

00:54:40.921 --> 00:54:43.065
- How was training?
- It was fine, Pres.

00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:44.174
Really?

00:54:57.688 --> 00:54:58.709
Let’s go?

00:55:09.508 --> 00:55:11.635
One more seat left!

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:12.828
Just one!

00:55:13.486 --> 00:55:14.139
Me!

00:55:14.163 --> 00:55:16.321
I wonder if he’s going to bring Via home.

00:55:16.874 --> 00:55:17.875
Thanks.

00:55:17.875 --> 00:55:18.897
Sure thing.

00:55:43.567 --> 00:55:45.485
I wonder if she got home safely?

00:56:02.586 --> 00:56:04.254
You’re such an idiot, Kino.

00:56:08.091 --> 00:56:09.760
Pres, you want some?

00:56:13.222 --> 00:56:14.640
Hey, let’s drop by Sevi’s place.

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.600
His house is just nearby, right?

00:56:17.726 --> 00:56:18.785
I got you something.

00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:19.978
Happy birthday!

00:56:21.813 --> 00:56:23.190
Don’t take it off, okay?

00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:25.442
Why is it AA?

00:56:25.442 --> 00:56:27.861
So, if the guy best
friend got a girlfriend...

00:56:27.861 --> 00:56:29.821
What happens then?

00:56:29.821 --> 00:56:33.450
Of course, he’d rather be with
his girlfriend than his friends.

00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:35.577
Are you being honest,
or are you still lying?

00:56:42.424 --> 00:56:45.837
You’ve really changed
since you’ve gotten older.

00:56:45.837 --> 00:56:46.846
So have you.

00:56:49.675 --> 00:56:50.968
Via.

00:56:52.719 --> 00:56:54.346
I’ll just be right here, okay?
